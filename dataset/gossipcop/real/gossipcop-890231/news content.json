He said that Mr. Spacey, who was then 26, had picked him up, placed him on a bed and climbed on top of him.\n\nMr. Spacey did not offer a comment to BuzzFeed. But shortly after the story was published, he released a statement in which he said he did not recall the encounter. \u201cBut if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nThe accusation \u201chas encouraged me to address other things about my life,\u201d he continued in the statement. He then publicly divulged for the first time that he had \u201cloved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Victor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html", "title": "Kevin Spacey Criticized for Using Apology to Anthony Rapp to Come Out", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-10-30T18:49:46.000Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T21:10:14.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/daniel-victor", "tag": "Sex Crimes", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005524481, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1b1df7ff-9311-54d9-8088-01e7a69af665", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/5d0472618d9d4bc0a1c98422cb19620c", "description": "Critics of Mr. Spacey\u2019s apologetic statement said he came out as gay as a distraction from a sexual accusation from Mr. Rapp, a fellow actor.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Daniel Victor", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Gay and Lesbian;LGBT;LGBTQ;Gay;Lesbian,Sexual harassment,Apologies,Kevin Spacey,Social Media,Actor,Anthony Rapp,BuzzFeed,Child Abuse,Rape", "pdate": 20171030, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html", "type": "article", "title": "Kevin Spacey Criticized for Using Apology to Anthony Rapp to Come Out", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Kevin Spacey in May."}, "description": "Critics of Mr. Spacey\u2019s apologetic statement said he came out as gay as a distraction from a sexual accusation from Mr. Rapp, a fellow actor."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html", "title": "Kevin Spacey Criticized for Using Apology to Anthony Rapp to Come Out", "description": "Critics of Mr. Spacey\u2019s apologetic statement said he came out as gay as a distraction from a sexual accusation from Mr. Rapp, a fellow actor.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/arts/31xp-spaceyreax/31xp-spaceyreax-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Kevin Spacey in May."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1b1df7ff-9311-54d9-8088-01e7a69af665"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1b1df7ff-9311-54d9-8088-01e7a69af665", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/kevin-spacey-reaction.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509292800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
