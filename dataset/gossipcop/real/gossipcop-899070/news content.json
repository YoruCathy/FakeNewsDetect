On Friday, two days before Sunday night\u2019s two-hour \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d special on E!, TMZ reported that 20-year-old Kylie Jenner, the youngest of matriarch Kris Jenner\u2019s six children, is pregnant by 25-year-old rapper Travis Scott.\n\nIn August, Kris and her five clients/daughters posed for The Hollywood Reporter, as siblings do, in flesh-toned lingerie, draped over and around each other seductively.\n\nIt\u2019s America\u2019s new normal, established by Kris. In the piece, she recounted hijinks from the show\u2019s pilot.\n\n\u201cThe watercooler chatter from the first episode was all about [9-year-old] Kylie jumping on a stripper pole,\u201d she said. \u201cKim had one installed in my bedroom . . . and Kylie hops up there, twirls around a couple of times, and it became this thing. When I look back on that, I belly laugh.\u201d\n\nOf course. It\u2019s not like Kylie, now 20, began pumping her face and body with filler and silicone as a teenager, or met her first boyfriend when she was 14 and he, the rapper Tyga, was 21, or that the majority of her very short life has been cannibalized for reality-TV fodder.\n\nIn any event, Kylie \u2014 with supermodel sister Kendall, social media empress Kim, and satellite siblings Khloe and Kourtney \u2014 have monetized their unique brand of fame into multimillion-dollar businesses. How and why is hard to explain; it\u2019s not as though their stardom is backed up by any discernible talent. The Kardashians are like the bitcoin of the celebrity-industrial complex, their currency backed by nothing but those who buy into it.\n\nAnd plenty do. According to Forbes, Kim made nearly $50 million in the last year from her app, emojis and endorsements. Kendall ranked No. 3 on the magazine\u2019s list of highest-paid models with $10 million in income. Kylie\u2019s makeup line grossed $420 million in its first 18 months and WWD reports it will earn $1 billion by 2022. Kourtney and Khloe earn between $10 million and $15 million each through social media endorsements.\n\nMuch was made of the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary this year \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 but consider the close ecological relationship between that technology and the concurrent rise of the Kardashians.\n\nThe clan has lived with us for 10 years now, and just as an entire generation doesn\u2019t know life pre-iPhone, they don\u2019t know life pre-Kardashian.\n\nOversexualized tween and teenage girls, sexting and oversharing online, with \u201csocial media influencer\u201d a viable career option \u2014 none of this would have happened without the Kardashians. Just as Lucille Ball set the template for the sitcom and Steve Allen the late-night talk show, the Kardashians invented a new kind of celebrity.\n\nThey\u2019ve also acculturated us to plastic surgery; never before have so many teenagers sought nips and tucks. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons has reported an uptick in the amount of teenagers undergoing cosmetic procedures: In 2014, 64,000 patients were ages 13-19; in 2015, that number was 64,470, with an additional 161,700 less invasive procedures performed that year. Now it\u2019s just a thing kids do before going back to school.\n\n\u201cThis is directly related to the surgery of the stars of their reality shows,\u201d Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, CEO of BeverlyHillsBody, told People.\n\nIt\u2019s the Kardashian Generation, and overseeing all is Kris Jenner, who has used her family\u2019s trashier aspects to muscle their way into the upper echelons of fashion and commerce. She may be among our greatest con artists, wearing us down by refusing to go away, her very staying power validating her pop-cultural omnipotence.\n\nThe woman who has pimped out her own daughters is now embraced as a feminist entrepreneur by no less than Lena Dunham, who published an interview with Jenner in her Lenny Letter last month. Noted was a framed photo, in Jenner\u2019s office, of daughter Khloe\u2019s mugshot after a DUI arrest. Kris has trained her offspring-cum-employees well in 21st-century shock art: \u201cKim Kardashian Reveals Her Favorite Sex Position, That She Pees in Her Spanx, and More Outrageous Things You Didn\u2019t Need to Know,\u201d ran a 2015 Us Weekly headline. Among those \u201cthings\u201d: Kim outed Kourtney for urinating in a common area at Miami\u2019s four-star Delano Hotel.\n\nTroubled brother Rob, who didn\u2019t attend Kim\u2019s wedding to Kanye West because, sources claim, Kim felt he was too overweight and unattractive, was reportedly reamed out by Kris after he quit filming in 2014. \u201cKris finally flat-out told him he\u2019s an embarrassment to the family,\u201d a source told Star that same year. \u201cShe called him a fat slob and told him he\u2019s losing out on business opportunities because no one wants someone as huge as him representing their products.\u201d\n\nYes: In Kris Jenner\u2019s world, being overweight is worse for the brand than pissing on the floor of a fancy hotel.\n\n\u201cRob feels that show has truly ruined his family,\u201d a source told Radar in February 2014. \u201cHe feels very alone.\u201d Rob\u2019s ex, Blac Chyna, with whom he has a child, also has a child with Kylie\u2019s ex Tyga \u2014 and, for a time in 2016, their own reality show. When he began ranting against Chyna and posting revenge porn last summer, Kris called in a crisis management team and her \u201cKUWTK\u201d crew to film it all.\n\n\u201cThe show must go on,\u201d a source told Hollywood Life.\n\nThe show itself really originated with Kim\u2019s sex tape, made when she was just 23 and allegedly sold by someone close to the family. A few months later, it was used to launch \u201cKUWTK.\u201d\n\nAlso documented, on the original show and multiple spinoffs: the broken husbands and partners who cycle in and out of the family, including NBA star Lamar Odom, who was increasingly upset over his portrayal on the show and ended up overdosing in a Vegas brothel. Odom was reportedly \u201cirate\u201d and \u201cinconsolable\u201d after watching, and told a friend that all the family \u201chad ever done was exploit him for the show . . . He felt chewed up and spat out.\u201d\n\nKourtney\u2019s small children can look forward to watching their father, Scott Disick, get black-out drunk repeatedly, his addiction a multi-season arc. She told THR that while filming the first season, she\u2019d sneak into the bathroom to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t think we even knew what we were saying yes to,\u201d said Khloe. \u201cKim and my mom were steering the ship.\u201d\n\nBy the time Bruce Jenner\u2019s divorce from Kris and subsequent gender reassignment surgery were announced in 2015, it was overshadowed as a storyline by the only question that really mattered: Who\u2019d control the reveal \u2014 Kris on \u201cKUTWK,\u201d or Bruce, soon to be Caitlyn, alone? (Caitlyn won.) Would Kanye, who largely sidesteps the show, make a cameo? (Yes.) When Kim got robbed in Paris last year, would she share her trauma on the show? (Yes, with E! airing a teaser trailer in which Kim tearfully recounted the moment she was sure \u201cthey\u2019re going to rape me.\u201d)\n\nIn the aftermath, Kim disappeared from social media and said she would stop with her vulgar displays of wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the money,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nNow, less than one year later, Kim\u2019s the star of the 10th-anniversary teaser, standing like a silent cyborg, looks and body radically altered by surgery and weaves and filler and implants, staring vacantly into space as a small army adorns her like the plastic doll she is.\n\nHer mother must be so proud.", "images": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/online-piano-class.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nup_170132_1863_149255416.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nup_170132_1863_149255416.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nup_170132_1863_149255416.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maureen Callahan", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/09/23/how-a-decade-of-the-kardashians-radically-changed-america/", "title": "How a decade of the Kardashians radically changed America", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
