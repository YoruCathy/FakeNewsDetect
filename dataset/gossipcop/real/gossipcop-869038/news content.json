The \u2018Power\u2019 star is sharing her workouts, daily eating schedule and beauty routine, which involves some KKW contouring, of course!\n\nIf there\u2019s one star who\u2019s crushing 2017 so far, it\u2019s La La Anthony, 38. She\u2019s killing it as LaKeisha in the Starz hit show, Power; she has a clothing line with Lorde & Taylor on the way, and she just wrapped filming on a movie, where she stars alongside Whoopi Goldberg, 61. So, it\u2019s no secret that La La\u2019s career is flourishing. And, that\u2019s all due to her hard work ethic and raw talent. But, La La also credits her success to being in the best shape of her life, both mentally and physically. When HL EXCLUSIVELY chatted with the entrepreneur, she took us inside her healthy lifestyle, where she dished on everything from sweating it out at NYC\u2019s star-studded gym, The Dogpound, to her eating and beauty routines, which includes her favorite product, Arm & Hammer Baking Soda!\n\nAnyone who knows La La, knows that she doesn\u2019t half-a-s anything, which is why she takes her high tensity workouts to NYC-based training facility, The Dogpound; also the workout destination for some of Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s hottest models, including Adriana Lima, 36. And, La La\u2019s got the VIP in. \u201cThe Dogpound is actually close to my house; the owner [CEO and Founder, Kirk Myers] and I are very close friends,\u201d La La tells us. \u201cAnd, I love to box.\u201d But, the actress, knows that when it comes to looking your best it\u2019s not only about sweating it out in the gym.\n\n\u201cWith looking right, it\u2019s mostly about your eating,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd, I feel like a lot of us struggle with that. I\u2019m trying to stay consistent in making better choices when it comes to food. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m always great at it, but I try to keep that in mind. You can\u2019t work your a-s off in the gym and then just throw it all away by eating horrible.\u201d Ultimately, La La says she\u2019s just trying to \u201cfind the balance\u201d with hustling in the gym, and fueling her body the right way. So, with that being said, she filled us in on her daily food diary. And, it\u2019s not as complicated as you may think\u2026\n\nLa La stays hydrated throughout the entire day, which is also part of her beauty routine [which you will see below]. In the morning, she starts her day with a protein shake. Then, for lunch, La La will have a piece of fish or chicken with vegetables. And, the same goes for dinner. Throughout the day, if she\u2019s hungry and needs a snack, La La will reach for a protein bar of any kind. And, like she said, it\u2019s all about the balance, which she\u2019s still perfecting. So, if it\u2019s one of those days where she either cheats or treats herself, she\u2019ll reach for her weakness, some chocolate; aka, her favorite, Nestle Crunch.\n\nWith physical, comes mental health, and both are equally important. And, no one understands that better than La La, who lives by the saying, \u201cWhen you look good, you feel good.\u201d Right now, La La\u2019s looking and feeling real good, if she does say so herself. Despite anything going on in her life, including her public split from husband, Carmelo Anthony, 32, La La says she\u2019s in a really good place. The stunning star confesses that working out and eating right have been major factors in getting her there because it\u2019s been \u201ctherapeutic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re putting time into yourself and you\u2019re really seeing the work pay off, you just have a different confidence about yourself. I\u2019m definitely in a great place,\u201d La La explains. \u201cI feel confident, I feel happy and I\u2019m just ready for what the next challenge is, as far as work is concerned; especially with acting; whatever that is going to be.\u201d\n\nAnother therapeutic tactic La La has in her life, is finally putting herself first. She explains that it\u2019s OK to focus on yourself in the midst of life\u2019s craziness and caring for others. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a good place, you can focus on your kids, your job, your family; you can focus on any relationships you\u2019re in. It\u2019s important to put yourself first and not feel bad about that,\u201d she points out. \u201cSometimes we worry about everyone else and we feel bad, instead of investing time and energy into ourselves. And, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now.\u201d\n\nWith all of the sweat La La sheds from her intense workouts, she really looks forward to her beauty routine. \u201cI\u2019m always staying hydrated,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s all about having great moisturizer and great bronzer, and I think you\u2019re good to go.\u201d And, what other bronzer is La La going to use than her best friend, Kim Kardashian\u2018s KKW contour kit! \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she gushes about Kim\u2019s product. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my closest friends. I support anything she does.\u201d And, when Kim dropped her beauty line, La La immediately phoned her for some assistance in the beauty department. \u201cI called her and I was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to send me a complete video tutorial, because I don\u2019t know how to use this.\u2019 Kim\u2019s way more savvy with all of that stuff more than I am.\u201d That\u2019s what friends are for right? When La La called, Kim delivered! \u201cShe sent a cool video and the contour sticks are great, I love them!\u201d\n\nWhen we caught up with La La she was with her friends at Arm & Hammer, who she recently partnered with because of her longtime love for the brand. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the brand in my life for as long as I can remember,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was surprised to know about all of the things you can do with Arm & Hammer Baking Soda, which is amazing. And, lately, I\u2019m always looking up new tricks to use it with. My most recent trick is putting a little bit of it on my toothbrush before I brush my teeth. It helps to give me a really nice, white smile!\u201d Say what? \u2014 We had no idea! \u201cYes!\u201d, La La says excitedly. \u201cIt has a million other uses \u2014 body scrub and cooking. I\u2019m just fascinated that one product can be used for so many things!\u201d La La, so are we!\n\nBe sure to catch La La on the small screen when Power returns to Starz in September!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what was your favorite tip from La La\u2019s amazing advice?", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/la-la-anthony-exclusive-interview-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/la-la-anthony-exclusive-interview-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F08%2F17%2Fla-la-anthony-workout-routine-diet-plan-beauty-products-interview%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2720992&comment_count=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/la-la-anthony-exclusive-interview-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/17/la-la-anthony-workout-routine-diet-plan-beauty-products-interview/", "title": "La La Anthony\u2019s Workouts That Have Her In The Best Shape Of Her Life & What She Eats In A Day", "meta_data": {"description": "It's no secret that La La Anthony is in the best shape of her life!
