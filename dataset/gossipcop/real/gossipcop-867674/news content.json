The kids, who were from the Make-A-Wish program, met with Reynolds, took photos with him, and even left with their own bamboo swords crafted by the film\u2019s prop master Dan Sissons. It was a heart-warming moment that Reynolds later shared on Instagram; however, not everyone was pleased with what they saw.\n\nOne apparently soulless Instagram user criticized the actor for allowing young children to visit the set of Deadpool, which centers on an anti-superhero who has a habit of dropping f-bombs. The commenter wrote: \u201cGuys [D]eadpool is [an] R rated movie and those kids are watching it\u2026I think something is wrong here [angry face emoji].\u201d\n\nReynolds hit back.\n\n\u201cYup. Deadpool is Rated R. If my kid went through a fraction of the shit these kids deal with daily, I think they can watch whatever they like. That\u2019s just my .02 cents,\u201d he responded.\n\nImage via Instagram\n\nDeadpool: 1. Internet troll: 0.\n\nYou can check out the photos from the Make-A-Wish visit below.
