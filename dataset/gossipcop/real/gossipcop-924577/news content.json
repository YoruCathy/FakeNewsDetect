He was 74.\n\nBochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. A family spokesman told the Associated Press that he died in his sleep on Sunday after a battle with cancer, but did not release details of a memorial service.\n\nWorking with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV\u2019s most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hourlongs featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.\n\nThe recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.\n\nOn \u201cNYPD Blue,\u201d he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger \u2014 who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. \u2014 drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.\n\nBochco launched such series as \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d \u2014 a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show \u2014 and \u201cL.A. Law\u201d for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (\u201cNYPD Blue,\u201d \u201cDoogie Howser, M.D.\u201d) and notable failures, including the musical police drama \u201cCop Rock\u201d and the serialized courtroom drama \u201cMurder One,\u201d which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title \u201cMurder in the First,\u201d for TNT, where it ran for three years.\n\nAsked how he could risk gambling on a musical like \u201cCop Rock\u201d given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, \u201cWith my deal, how could I not?\u201d\n\nBochco wasn\u2019t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d led to the actor\u2019s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former \u201cL.A. Law\u201d co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run for 11 years.\n\nAlthough Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of \u201cHill Street\u201d was born more out of necessity than design.\n\n\u201cWe had so many characters that we realized we couldn\u2019t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,\u201d he told the New York Times.\n\nThe producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When \u201cCop Rock\u201d came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.\n\nBochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d \u2013 which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered \u2013 ultimately helped promote the series and turned it into a hit.\n\nSteven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company\u2019s onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.\n\nHe started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included \u201cColumbo,\u201d with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.\n\nBochco wrote such features as \u201cThe Movie Maker\u201d and \u201cSilent Running\u201d before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including \u201cDelvecchio,\u201d a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came \u201cBay City Blues,\u201d about a baseball team, which didn\u2019t last.\n\nWith \u201cHill Street Blues,\u201d Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like \u201cHill Street\u201d and \u201cCheers\u201d was rewarded after \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.\n\nBeyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on \u201cHill Street\u201d and enlisting David E. Kelley \u2014 then a Boston lawyer \u2014 to work on \u201cL.A. Law.\u201d\n\nWhen the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as \u201cthe standard all television producers strive for.\u201d\n\nFor all of his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire \u201cCapitol Critters\u201d to \u201cPublic Morals,\u201d an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.\n\nAlthough major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of \u201cCommander in Chief\u201d \u2014 an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president \u2014 and co-creating \u201cOver There,\u201d an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.\n\nBochco also produced the legal drama \u201cRaising the Bar\u201d for TNT that ran two seasons in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe producer also tried his hand at novels, writing \u201cDeath by Hollywood,\u201d a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist. His struggle with leukemia prompted him to write his autobiography, \u201cTruth is a Total Defense: My Fifty Years in Television,\u201d which he self-published in 2016.\n\nBochco was loyal to his friends \u2014 certain actors appeared in his shows time and again \u2014 but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.\n\nBochco\u2019s association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in \u201cHill Street Blues,\u201d and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on \u201cL.A. Law\u201d as the wife of firm partner Douglas Brackman, played by her real-life husband (and thus Bochco\u2019s brother-in-law), Alan Rachins. The producer later married Dayna Kalins, a TV executive. His son, Jesse, became a prominent director, working on many of his father\u2019s shows.\n\nBochco was thrice married, the first time to Gabrielle Levin, the second to Bosson.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife Dayna Kalins, whom he married in 2000, as well children Melissa Bochco, Jesse Bochco and Sean Flanagan, and two grandchildren.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/rexfeatures_6528331a_edited.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fsteven-bochco-dead-dies-nypd-blue-1202741169%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202741169&comment_count=25"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/rexfeatures_6528331a_edited.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/steven-bochco-dead-dies-nypd-blue-1202741169/", "title": "Steven Bochco, Innovative Co-Creator of \u2018NYPD Blue,\u2019 \u2018Hill Street Blues,\u2019 Dies at 74", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Steven Bochco, a producer whose boundary-pushing series such as \u201cHill Street Blues\u201d and \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d helped define the modern TV drama, has died.
