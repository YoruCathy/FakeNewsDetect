Now, they're putting those red carpet outfits up for auction to benefit the movement's legal defense fund. The initiative was announced Wednesday by Time's Up, eBay, and Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2014 Glamour 's parent company\u2014who are teaming up to run the auction taking place this Friday.\n\n\"We\u2019re thrilled that actors and others in the entertainment industry are leading in this extraordinary way to end the scourge of workplace sexual harassment,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, the President and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which is in charge of Time's Up's legal defense fund. \u201cEach time they\u2019ve stepped up they\u2019ve inspired more attorneys to join the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund and more individuals to contribute.\"\n\nThe black dresses and tuxedos were donated by the designers, who include Versace, Vera Wang, Armani, Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and many others, and all money raised will be donated to the Time's Up legal defense fund. The outfits will be available for bidding starting January 19, here , with the auction running through January 26.\n\nGood news: there's a way to participate even if you don't have the funds to buy a dress worn by, say, Reese Witherspoon. Three of the dresses, designed by Stella McCartney for Claire Foy, Diane von Furstenburg for Madeline Brewer, and Rosie Assoulin for Mandy Moore, will be part of a sweepstakes for eBay users who donate $25 or more to the legal defense fund.\n\n\"At Cond\u00e9 Nast, we've always believed in the importance of swift action to support meaningful social change,\u201d said Cond\u00e9 Nast Artistic Director and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour in the press release. \u201cThrough this auction powered by eBay for Charity, and harnessing the compelling pull of both fashion and activism, we're hopeful that the black dresses worn at this year's historic Golden Globe Awards will raise funds for the Time's Up initiative, and serve to support the stories and voices of those who have been victims of sexual misconduct.\"\n\nHere's the full list of designers and celebrities who are donating their looks:\n\nArmani \u2013 Laura Dern\n\nBalenciaga \u2013 Salma Hayek Pinault\n\nBrandon Maxwell -
