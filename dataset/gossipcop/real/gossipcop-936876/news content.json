This time, the third in line to the throne was all smiles as Phillips appeared to play a pretend instrument at the event.\n\nWhen he was caught being mischievous this time, George covered his own mouth as he realized the cameras were on him.\n\nThe personalities were on display out the steps outside the chapel \u2013 the young princess waved to the crowd as her older brother shyly hid behind the other bridesmaids.\n\nThe design on the bridesmaid and page boy uniforms incorporated the Mark Bradford artwork included in the Order of Service.\n\nCharlotte had no compunction with modeling for the cameras.\n\nHer bridesmaid flowers, which included posies of Lily of the Valley and spray roses, reflected the bridal bouquet designed by Rob Van Helden.\n\nShe also gave a smile and waved to the crowd while arriving for the ceremony in a car with other bridesmaids and page boys.\n\nMarried!
