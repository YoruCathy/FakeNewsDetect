On Monday (July 17), Bieber surprised kids at Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County to meet fans, take pictures and say prayers with patients.\n\nA number of fans and their parents took to social media to share photos of the \u201cDespacito\u201d singer. One mother named Brandie Runner was pleasantly surprised to see the recording artist stop by to see her daughter Victoria, sharing on Instagram, \u201cSo ... our nurse comes in and asks Victoria if she's been asked about having a visitor? We say no. \u2026 Anyone wanna guess who her visitor was?!! #justinbeiber.\u201d\n\nRunner captioned another photo, \u201cWhat a blessing this day was to her (& I). I never knew he had this big of a heart.\u201d Bieber spent time with several other fans, spreading smiles and hugs, and even a few dabs.\n\nSee photos and footage of Bieber's visit below.\n\nJuly 17: Justin with a fan at a children's hospital in Orange County, California. #justinbieber #bieber #california #jb #purposetour A post shared by HQ Bieber News (@hqbiebernews) on Jul 17, 2017 at 2:07pm PDT\n\nJuly 17: Justin with a fan at a children's hospital in Orange County, California. #justinbieber #bieber #california #jb #purposetour A post shared by HQ Bieber News (@hqbiebernews) on Jul 17, 2017 at 2:06pm PDT", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/justin-bieber-purpose-2016-red-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?c596412deda54d9a807d"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/justin-bieber-purpose-2016-red-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sadie Bell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7872869/justin-bieber-surprises-kids-childrens-hospital-of-orange-county-pics-videos", "title": "Justin Bieber Surprises Fans at Children's Hospital of Orange County", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-07-18T14:35:31-04:00", "published_time": "2017-07-18T10:39:28-04:00"}, "description": "On Monday (July 17) Justin Bieber stopped by Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Orange County to meet fans, completely surprising them with his heartwarming visit.", "og": {"description": "On Monday (July 17) Justin Bieber stopped by Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Orange County to meet fans, completely surprising them with his heartwarming visit.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/justin-bieber-purpose-2016-red-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Justin Bieber Surprises Kids at Hospital of Orange County: See Pics | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7872869/justin-bieber-surprises-kids-childrens-hospital-of-orange-county-pics-videos", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Justin Bieber Surprises Fans at Children's Hospital of Orange County", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "On Monday (July 17) Justin Bieber stopped by Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital of Orange County to meet fans, completely surprising them with his heartwarming visit.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/justin-bieber-purpose-2016-red-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Justin Bieber Surprises Fans at Children's Hospital of Orange County", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500388768.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
