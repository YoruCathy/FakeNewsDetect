Eliza Dushku said she wasn\u2019t invited to the recent Buffy the Vampire Slayer reunion coordinated by Entertainment Weekly in honor of the show\u2019s 20th anniversary. Watch our video above to relive the best Buffy moments!\n\nThe 36-year-old actress, who played Faith on the drama, blamed the snub on having a recurring, on-and-off role (rather than a core cast part) on the series, which ran from 1997 to 2003. \u201cYour [hearts] will go on..!\u201d she tweeted on Wednesday, March 29. \u201cFaith/I will never a series regular cast member of btvs, sweeties=no invite. Cute n special reunion tho #ScoobyGang.\u201d\n\nHottest Couples Who Fell in Love on Set\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar touched on the missing cast members during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Tuesday, April 4. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Eliza,\u201d she said of why she wasn\u2019t at the reunion. \u201cI didn\u2019t control \u2014 I think there was just so many people, it was hard enough.\u201d\n\nTV Shows Gone Too Soon!\n\nAnthony Stewart Head, who played Rupert Giles, was also MIA from the reunion, and said he was busy with his upcoming play. \u201cSo sad I couldn\u2019t join the reunion \u2014 wasn\u2019t for lack of trying \u2014 literally coincided with the tech research of Love in Idleness. Bummer x,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cEW worked hard to have my presence felt \u2014 in a portrait on set and an interview. Here\u2019s to 20 years and a wonderful group of people x.\u201d\n\nGellar, 39, told Cohen it just wasn\u2019t the same without Head. \u201cThere was an oil painting that they had made of him, but it was really sad to not have him,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-80db6ca9-0bc2-4799-91f8-8b9c62b69200.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-7996a770-ca5b-4fe7-96be-d63b2d064d19.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-3c2ad87e-528d-471f-b0cc-e963ce2a29a8.jpg?crop=116px%2C1px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-3c2ad87e-528d-471f-b0cc-e963ce2a29a8.jpg?crop=116px%2C1px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eliza-dushku-says-she-wasnt-invited-to-buffy-reunion-w475099/", "title": "Eliza Dushku Says She Wasn\u2019t Invited to \u2018Buffy\u2019 Reunion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Eliza Dushku said she wasn\u2019t invited to the \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 reunion for the show\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Eliza Dushku Says She Wasn\u2019t Invited to \u2018Buffy\u2019 Reunion", "description": "Eliza Dushku said she wasn\u2019t invited to the \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 reunion for the show\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eliza-dushku-says-she-wasnt-invited-to-buffy-reunion-w475099/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:20:29+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-3c2ad87e-528d-471f-b0cc-e963ce2a29a8.jpg?crop=116px%2C1px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-3c2ad87e-528d-471f-b0cc-e963ce2a29a8.jpg?crop=116px%2C1px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-05T16:05:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:20:29+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Eliza Dushku said she wasn\u2019t invited to the \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 reunion for the show\u2019s 20th anniversary \u2014 find out more", "title": "Eliza Dushku Says She Wasn\u2019t Invited to \u2018Buffy\u2019 Reunion", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/eliza-dushku-3c2ad87e-528d-471f-b0cc-e963ce2a29a8.jpg?crop=116px%2C1px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491408300.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
