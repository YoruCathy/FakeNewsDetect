Martin novels that is based upon, fans have gone into overdrive trying to work out how the show will conclude. The Game of Thrones season seven finale saw Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilai Clarke) enjoy a steamy romp after they believed Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) had promised to help them defeat the Night King (Vladimir Furdik). However, Cersei has chosen to betray the pair in the hope that they will be killed and she can continue to rule Westeros in peace. Following her betrayal, fans have begun to speculate about how Jon and Daenerys will cope without her help. One in particular has theorised that they will have to make a huge sacrifice in order to safe the country.\n\nReddit user luimonade, noted: \u201cThe series has always been about one simple premise: the parallels of life (what must exist) and death (what threatens the balance, magic), each one represented by a character. Each one a parallel of the other.\u201d They explained that Deanerys appears to represent life and fire. Her character has always been viewed as a mother figure. Meanwhile, Jon represents death and ice. His storyline has revolved around the threat of the White Walkers and he has become the one leading the crusade to fight against them. The user goes on to explain that the characters have always been destined to meet and following their night of passion, they could have a baby. Luimonade continued: \u201cThe last time the representations of life (Azor Ahai) and death (Nissa) \u201ccreated\u201d something, was a \u201cpower\u201d (Lightbringer) able to defeat the while walkers.\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s heartbreaking sacrifice revealed?\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Will Daenerys and Jon sacrifice their unborn baby?\n\n\u201cThe twist: the White Walkers\u2019 ultimate goal has always been to stop/kill Daenerys and Jon\u2019s baby. \"They knew from the start this being would exist in the future, and that it represents the power to defeat them all, somehow. \u201cThe series has had these three stories (Jon\u2019s, Dany\u2019s and the White Walkers/Night King\u2019s) advancing since the beginning to meet at this point.\u201d They theorised that the final season will therefore see Daenerys and Jon have a bittersweet ending.
