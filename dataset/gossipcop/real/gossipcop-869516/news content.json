Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.\n\nOther conditions \u2014 such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors \u2014 can cause facial muscle weakness that mimics Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:\n\nElectromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.\n\nThis test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.\n\nTreatment\n\nMost people with Bell's palsy recover fully \u2014 with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.\n\nMedications\n\nCommonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:\n\nCorticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.\n\nsuch as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents.

Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) or acyclovir (Zovirax) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.\n\nPhysical therapy\n\nParalyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.\n\nSurgery\n\nIn the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.\n\nRarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems. Facial reanimation helps to make the face look more even and may restore facial movement. Examples of this type of surgery include eyebrow lift, eyelid lift, facial implants and nerve grafts. Some procedures, such as an eyebrow lift, may need to be repeated after several years.\n\nLifestyle and home remedies\n\nHome treatment may include:\n\nProtecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.\n\nUsing lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist.

Doing your physical therapy exercises. Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.\n\nAlternative medicine\n\nAlthough there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine for people with Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following:\n\nAcupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief.\n\nPlacing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief. Biofeedback training. By teaching you to use your thoughts to control your body, biofeedback training may help you gain better control over your facial muscles.\n\nPreparing for your appointment\n\nYou'll likely start by seeing your family doctor. However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to a neurologist.\n\nIt's good to prepare for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing. Be sure to include any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\n\nBe sure to include any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.

Write down questions you want to ask your doctor.\n\nPreparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For Bell's palsy, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's the most likely cause of my symptoms?\n\nAre there any other possible causes for my symptoms?\n\nWhat kinds of tests do I need?\n\nIs this condition likely temporary or long lasting?\n\nWhat treatments are available for Bell's palsy? Which do you recommend?\n\nAre there alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?\n\nI have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?\n\nAre there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask any additional questions that occur to you during your appointment.\n\nWhat to expect from your doctor\n\nBe prepared to answer questions from your doctor, such as:\n\nWhen did you begin having symptoms?\n\nHave your symptoms been continuous or occasional?\n\nHow severe are your symptoms?\n\nWhat, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?\n\nWhat, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?\n\nHave any of your relatives ever had Bell's palsy or problems with facial paralysis?\n\nHave you had any symptoms of a more generalized infection?\n\nWhat you can do in the meantime\n\nIf you have facial pain:\n\nTake over-the-counter pain relievers.
