Ten years and two children later, the couple is still just as madly in love as they were when they first wed. And in honor of that love and their anniversary, both Brady and B\u00fcndchen shared never-before-seen shots from their wedding day to Instagram, writing the sweetest love notes to each other along with their post.\n\n\"Ten years ago, I didn\u2019t realize how much I could love you and the family we created together. My heart is so full and I am so blessed! I know our journey has not been easy, but the challenges we have overcome have made our bond stronger and our love grow deeper,\" Brady wrote, alongside a photo of he and his wife kissing during the ceremony. \"Thank you for loving me, for supporting my dreams, and for nurturing our family in the way that only you could. You are my rock, my love and my light! I love you and I love our family! \ud83c\udf1f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d #bosslady\"\n\nGisele also took to social media to gush over her spouse. \"I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already been 10 years since we\u2019ve chosen to walk this life together...and what incredible 10 years we\u2019ve had! There is nothing that I love more in this world than you and our family,\" she wrote next to three shots of the couple. \"Thank you for being on this journey with me and for doing the work that it takes to make it so special. May we continue growing together, walking side by side supporting and loving one another for many many years to come. Te amo tanto\u2764\"\n\nThough the two are anything but quiet about their romance, the couple had a very private ceremony when they got married for the first time (their second ceremony took place later that year in Costa Rica). The two said their I do's only a month after they got engaged. Their ceremony included close family and friends in a traditional Catholic ceremony.\n\n\"We planned [the wedding] in like 10 days, and it was perfect,\" Brady told GQ in 2009. \"We went back to the house and I barbecued aged New York strips. We had champagne, a cake, some ice cream. It was a great night.\"\n\nOn their ninth anniversary last year, the couple also rolled out a few never-before-seen shots showing off B\u00fcndchen's stunning off-the-shoulder lace gown.\n\nHappy anniversary to these two lovebirds!", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/RCRh543cuWdafZ7PD3nSq_6M_xs=/2272x1278/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5c757af6d61e8e234ebfb684__169-c0ba085d0b3049cdb876a5f843c83e07.jpeg", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/MS9YFx1OAM0Tt_eCQjqPdlhH3lU=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5c757af6d61e8e234ebfb684__11-9e8293c1d0084db8a7888255a4894b71.jpeg", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/RCRh543cuWdafZ7PD3nSq_6M_xs=/2272x1278/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5c757af6d61e8e234ebfb684__169-c0ba085d0b3049cdb876a5f843c83e07.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Oehler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/gisele-bundchen-never-before-seen-wedding-pic-10-year-anniversary", "title": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen's 10-Year Anniversary Note to Tom Brady Is Giving Us All the Feels", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "And she shared some never-before-seen shots from her wedding day to the football player 10 years ago", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "BRIDES", "sailthru.author": "Christina Oehler", "sailthru.tags": "news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/gisele-bundchen-never-before-seen-wedding-pic-10-year-anniversary", "title": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen's 10-Year Anniversary Note to Tom Brady Is Giving Us All the Feels", "description": "And she shared some never-before-seen shots from her wedding day to the football player 10 years ago", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/RCRh543cuWdafZ7PD3nSq_6M_xs=/2272x1278/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5c757af6d61e8e234ebfb684__169-c0ba085d0b3049cdb876a5f843c83e07.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen's 10-Year Anniversary Note to Tom Brady Is Giving Us All the Feels", "description": "And she shared some never-before-seen shots from her wedding day to the football player 10 years ago", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/OsWHLXrISf2W1-UFa1REmCUfMtg=/1972x1972/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5c757af6d61e8e234ebfb684__11-9e8293c1d0084db8a7888255a4894b71.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
