Rapp described Spacey climbing on top of him on a bed at a party in 1986 before he was ultimately able to get away and leave the room. Spacey also took the opportunity to address the rumors about his sexuality, revealing for the first time publicly that he \u201cchooses\u201d to \u201clive as a gay man.\u201d In a 2010 interview with The Daily Beast, Spacey declined to specify his sexual orientation, saying, \u201cNo one\u2019s personal life is in the public interest.
