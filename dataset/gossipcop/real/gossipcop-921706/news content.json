Taylor Swift has made her mark on a fair share of weddings, and what she did for one lucky couple in New York on Saturday, March 17, is no exception.\n\nImagine Edward and Margaret McNoble\u2019s surprise when The Carltun at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York, informed them that a bottle of champagne was waiting for them with a special note from Swift attached. \u201cRumor has it you might be using my song in your wedding celebration which makes me so happy! Here\u2019s to this amazing day of your continuing love story. Love, Taylor,\u201d the songstress wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to the wedding venue, they told us, \u2018There [is] a special gift upstairs for you from a very special person,\u2019\u201d the New York-based newlyweds tell Us Weekly. \u201cIt was awesome. It was such a great day. With all the moving parts, this was a great surprise! To get a bottle of Dom is a very nice gift, and then to see it\u2019s from Taylor Swift is an even better gift!\u201d\n\nSwift must have found out that they were using her music in their ceremony \u2014 the duo walked in to \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d and shared their first dance to \u201cLove Story.\u201d A source says the pop star would have tried to make it to the wedding, but she was in L.A.\n\nThe \u201cDelicate\u201d singer has a history of making weddings memorable for the bride and groom. She famously crashed a fan\u2019s big day in New Jersey in June 2016 to perform \u201cBlank Space\u201d as the newly-married couple danced. Swift also played bridesmaid and gave a risqu\u00e9 speech at her best friend Abigail Anderson\u2019s wedding in September 2017.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-swift2.jpg?crop=148px%2C49px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-swift2.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-champagne.jpg?w=225", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-swift2.jpg?crop=148px%2C49px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-sends-couple-bottle-of-champagne-at-wedding/", "title": "Taylor Swift Sends Couple Bottle of Champagne at Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Taylor Swift sent one very lucky couple a bottle of champagne when she found out they were using her song in their celebration \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift Surprises Couple With Bottle of Champagne at Their Wedding", "description": "Taylor Swift sent one very lucky couple a bottle of champagne when she found out they were using her song in their celebration \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-sends-couple-bottle-of-champagne-at-wedding/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-swift2.jpg?crop=148px%2C49px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-swift2.jpg?crop=148px%2C49px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-19T20:39:55+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Taylor Swift sent one very lucky couple a bottle of champagne when she found out they were using her song in their celebration \u2014 details", "title": "Taylor Swift Surprises Couple With Bottle of Champagne at Their Wedding", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/taylor-swift2.jpg?crop=148px%2C49px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521491995.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
