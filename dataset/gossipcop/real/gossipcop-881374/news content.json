One of the best moments in my life.\n\nPeak mayhem as Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson announce pregnancy\n\n(Photo: BACKGRID)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m soo happy to be on this journey together with you and creating this angel from the man above. Everyday I give thanks to him for bring[ing] us together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I love you soo much and I know our little angel feels the love we share together and will know that mommy and daddy loves them unconditional forever and ever amen.\n\nHe added: \u2018BTW, shoutout the brodie @brandonjennings for bringing this King and Queen together. Love my G.\u201d\n\nWho is Brandon Jennings?\n\nWho set them up? This guy *points to this guy* (Photo by G Fiume/Getty Images)\n\nHe\u2019s a 28-year-old pro who played for the New York Knicks in their 2016-17 season.\n\nTristan once said of the role Brandon played introducing them in August last year that, it was \u2018one of the best lobs (he) has ever thrown in his career.\u2019\n\nKhloe has already spoken about how she met Tristan, telling Ryan Seacrest about the moment it all came together.\n\nShe said: \u2018Brandon Jennings, who is a basketball player, he is a friend of mine and Malika [Haqq]\u2019s, and he was like, \u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl, I want to introduce you to someone\u201d,\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018I was at the Bel-Air hotel. [Tristan] came to the dinner because I didn\u2019t want to go on a blind date, so Brandon kind of ambushed the blind date.\n\n\u2018So, I had a bunch of people and he brought him and we just connected.\u2019\n\nNow look where we are\u2026\n\nLate last night UK time Khloe broke the news she was expecting a baby with her boyfriend of a year, Tristan.\n\nIn a length Instagram post, accompanied by a glistening bump pic, she said: \u2018My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient. I still at times can\u2019t believe that our love created life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Tristan, thank you for loving me the way that you do! Thank you for treating me like a Queen! Thank you for making me feel beautiful at all stages! Tristan, most of all, Thank you for making me a MOMMY!!! You have made this experience even more magical than I could have envisioned!\u2019\n\nThe post has been liked more than 6.7 million times in 12 hours, so we reckon it\u2019ll give Beyonce\u2019s February pregnancy announcement shot a run for its money as most-liked post of 2017.\n\nShe\u2019s got five million likes and eight days to go.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
