I think that I am still actually processing,' she explained.\n\nStephane Cardinale - Corbis Getty Images\n\n'I feel like I got gangbanged by the f*cking planet. There was not one person in the world that is not capable of seeing these intimate photos of me.'\n\n'You could just be at a barbecue and someone could just pull it up on their phone.'\n\nThe Hunger Games star revealed that several women had contacted her about bringing a lawsuit against technology company Apple which later revealed hackers hadn't penetrated its systems, as was widely believed, rather targeted 'names, passwords and security questions'.\n\nI think that I am still actually processing\n\nDespite the leak, the star decided not to sue the tech giant.\n\n'None of that was going to bring me peace and none of that was going to bring my nude body back to me and Nick [Holt], the person they were intended for,' she explained.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and then-boyfriend Nicholas Holt | ELLE UK Getty Images\n\nDuring the interview, Lawrence recalled a time when someone came up to her following the incident and described her as a role model for young women, forcing her to run to the toilets and burst into tears.\n\n'I feel like I got gangbanged by the f*cking planet\n\n'I felt like an impostor or I felt like I can't believe someone still feels that way,' she admitted.\n\nTouching on the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault and harassment scandal which came to light a month prior, the star described the film producer as a 'paternal' figure in her career.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'Then with Harvey Weinstein, it was bizarre. I heard that he was a dog but he was always almost paternal to me,' she shared.\n\n'He was never inappropriate with me. I thought we had a nice relationship where when he acted like an asshole, I called him an asshole. I actually think the word I used was a sadistic monster, but it was just never of that nature so that was really shocking.'\n\nWhen he acted like an asshole, I called him an asshole\n\nWhile several A-listers including the likes of Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman and Angelina Jolie have spoken up about the sexual misconduct they've endured during their careers, the Californian star admitted: 'I have never had a man use his power to sexually abuse me.'\n\nFeeling sexually violated\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey for The Hollywood Reporter in December 2017, the star said that the hack made her \u2018afraid\u2019 of going nude in a film.\n\n\u2018I just thought, \u201cI'll never do that again. I'll never share that part of myself ever since it got shared against my will\u201d,\u2019 she told the presenter.\n\nThe Passengers actress added that she would rather have been burgled than having photos of her nude body shared online.\n\nJamie McCarthy Getty Images\n\n\u2018I would much prefer my whole house to have been invaded,\u2019 she admitted.\n\n\u2018That's what's so scary about electronic (things). I have such fear with my phone and my computer and electronics.\n\nI would much prefer my whole house to have been invaded\n\n\u2018It's taking somebody's intellectual property but also my body.\n\n\u2018It was violating on a sexual level.\u2019\n\nGoing nude on camera for the first time\n\nIn March 2018, the actress defended her decision to do a nude scene in her spy film, Red Sparrow, in which she plays a Russian ballerina-turned assassin. The film marked the first time the star went nude for a role and was admittedly something she says \u2018scared the hell\u2019 out of her.\n\n\u2018I tried to do the movie without nudity but realised it just wouldn\u2019t be right to put the character through something that I, myself, am not willing to go through,\u2019 Lawrence told Vanity Fair.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear was that people would say, \u201cOh, how can you complain about the hack if you\u2019re going to get nude anyway?\u201d\u2019 Lawrence added.\n\nThe 29-year-old explained that it was her decision to go nude \u2013 no one else\u2019s. \u2018I got something back that was taken from me, and it also felt normal,\u2019 she explained.\n\nLawrence continued, stating that working with the film\u2019s director Francis Lawrence, with whom she filmed the Hunger Games franchise, helped her feel at ease on set during some of the more uncomfortable moments while nude on the set of the spy film.\n\n\u2018He looked me right in the eyes like I had clothes on and then all of a sudden I was like, \u201cOh, okay it\u2019s just like I have clothes on\u201d,\u2019 she told the magazine. \u2018Everybody here is professional. You\u2019re still at work. One look just made me comfortable. It didn\u2019t make me feel naked.\u2019", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/16/24/1600x800/landscape-1465854559-jenifer-lawrence-wedding.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-513018622-1569320312.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.718xh;0,0.0229xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh&resize=1200:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40104/jennifer-lawrence-why-she-didnt-sue-nude-photo-leak-scandal/", "title": "Everything Jennifer Lawrence Has Ever Said About Her Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Everything Jennifer Lawrence Has Ever Said About Her Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "description": "'You could just be at a barbecue and someone could just pull it up on their phone'", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40104/jennifer-lawrence-why-she-didnt-sue-nude-photo-leak-scandal/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2019-09-26 04:54:36", "published_time": "2019-09-24 11:00:00", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Explains Why She Didn't Sue Over Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence has opened up about how she felt following her nude photo hacking in 2014 on several occasions over the years.", "keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence, Nude Photo Leak Scandal, Jennifer Lawrence actress, Jennifer Lawrence boyfriend, Jennifer Lawrence relationship, Jennifer Lawrence and Harvey Weinstein", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.257xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,jennifer lawrence", "sailthru.date": "2019-09-24T11:00:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.257xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Everything Jennifer Lawrence Has Ever Said About Her Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1569294000.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
