Now she's elaborating on why she did it.\n\nInstagram stories @DdLovato\n\n\"I just thought to myself, someone needs to show my fans and anybody that's looking at my account that what you see isn't always what's real,\" Lovato told E! News.\n\n\"And so, I decided to embrace my flaws and\u2014I don't even like to call them flaws, it's just a part of who I am\u2014and show the world that I'm imperfect, but that's what makes me beautiful.\"\n\nInstagram stories @DdLovato\n\nDemi posted her thighs (pointing out that she doesn't have a gap), the cellulite on her butt, and her stretch marks/stomach skin. She's been vocal in the past about suffering from eating disorders and depression, and has said loving herself has always been a struggle.\n\nInstagram stories @DdLovato\n\nDieting isn't part of her life, but she does bring a nutritionist on tour with her as well as a personal trainer to stay healthy.\n\n\"I think that dieting is something that we've been forced to kind of do because of the diet culture...we're praised if we don't eat fried chicken and we eat a salad,\" she said. It's like, sometimes that's what you want and it's OK to treat yourself every once in a while.\"\n\nYES DEMI. Bring on allllll the fried chicken.\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/2560x1280/landscape-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg?resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/2560x1280/landscape-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Baty", "Emma Baty Is The Associate Entertainment Editor At Cosmopolitan Who Focuses On Movies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a19732327/demi-lovato-why-she-posted-cellulite-pics/", "title": "Demi Lovato Explains Why She Posted Those Cellulite Pics", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Demi Lovato Explains Why She Posted Those Cellulite Pics", "description": "Her reasoning is *so* powerful.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a19732327/demi-lovato-why-she-posted-cellulite-pics/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/2560x1280/landscape-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-04-10 03:26:32", "published_time": "2018-04-10 03:26:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/2560x1280/landscape-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Demi Lovato Explains Why She Posted Those Cellulite Pics", "description": "Her reasoning is *so* powerful.", "keywords": "demi lovato, cellulite, demi lovato cellulite pics, demi lovato self love", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/1280x1280/square-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-10T15:26:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/2560x1280/landscape-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/16/41/1280x1280/square-1476363505-gettyimages-610284130.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Demi Lovato Explains Why She Posted Those Cellulite Pics", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523301960.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
