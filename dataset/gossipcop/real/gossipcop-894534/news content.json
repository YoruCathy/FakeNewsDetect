Promise me you won't let them take my leg,\" she pleads with her wife. Time will tell if Arizona ever forgives her.\n\nThere's also more info on Cristina's departure from Seattle Grace in the trailer. After the crash, she doesn't respond to Meredith and throws a vase at the window when the new interns are staring at her.\n\nPlus, it seems Derek may not be able to do surgery anytime soon and an old flame will be rekindled: Jackson (Jesse Williams) asks April (Sarah Drew), \u201cDo you want to get married?\u201d and then they kiss.\n\nFind out what happens on \"Grey's Anatomy\" on Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad3b982500009400377040.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5642a200000e80000ba59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/greys-anatomy-arizona-loses-leg_n_1933221", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy': Arizona Loses Her Leg, April And Jackson Rekindle Romance And More In Season 9 Trailer (VIDEO)", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The Season 9 premiere of \"Grey's Anatomy\" (Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC) jumped forward one month after Arizona (Jessica Capshaw), Mark (Eric Dane), Cri...", "keywords": "Jessica Capshaw,ellen pompeo,Video, tv,patrick dempsey,sara ramirez,Sandra Oh,tv canada,Eric Dane,fall tv", "og": {"title": "Arizona's Amputation, Rekindled Romance & More 'Grey's Anatomy' Season 9 Trailer", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/greys-anatomy-arizona-loses-leg_n_1933221", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The Season 9 premiere of \"Grey's Anatomy\" (Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC) jumped forward one month after Arizona (Jessica Capshaw), Mark (Eric Dane), Cri..."}, "article": {"tag": "Jessica Capshaw,ellen pompeo,Video, tv,patrick dempsey,sara ramirez,Sandra Oh,tv canada,Eric Dane,fall tv", "section": "TV & Film", "published_time": "2012-10-02 16:46:13 -0400", "modified_time": "2012-10-02 17:35:43 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@", "title": "Arizona's Amputation, Rekindled Romance & More 'Grey's Anatomy' Season 9 Trailer", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The Season 9 premiere of \"Grey's Anatomy\" (Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC) jumped forward one month after Arizona (Jessica Capshaw), Mark (Eric Dane), Cri..."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_1933221", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "tv"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1349107200.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
