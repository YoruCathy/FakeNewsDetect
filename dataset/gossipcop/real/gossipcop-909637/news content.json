Abuse isn\u2019t just in the moment, it\u2019s for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nIn a statement last week, United States Olympic Committee officials issued an apology to Nassar\u2019s victims:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar\u2019s victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are,\u201d CEO Scott Blackmun said in the statement. \u201cWe have said it in other contexts, but we have not been direct enough with you. We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren\u2019t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Carlos Osorio/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn a recent statement, USA Gymnastics officials said that they have \u201cand will continue to take specific and concrete steps to promote athlete safety, health and well-being and prevent future abuse by adopting and vigorously enforcing the USA Gymnastics Safe Sport Policy.\u201d USA Gymnastics entire board of directors resigned on Friday.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Flarry-nassar-1-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fjohn-legend4-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fchrissy-teigen9-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fjohn-legend4-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/sports/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-donate-200k-times-up-usa-gymnastics-team/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Donate $200,000 to Time's Up on Behalf of 'Heroic' USA Gymnasts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Aly Raisman,Chrissy Teigen,John Legend,Music News,News,Sports", "news_keywords": "Aly Raisman,Chrissy Teigen,John Legend,Music News,News,Sports", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend\u00a0donated $200,000 to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund on behalf of the \u201cheroic gymnasts of the USA Gymnastics Team\"", "og": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Donate $200,000 to Time's Up on Behalf of 'Heroic' USA Gymnasts", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/sports/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-donate-200k-times-up-usa-gymnastics-team/", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have opened up their wallets on behalf of all the gymnasts who were sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fjohn-legend4-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/sports/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-donate-200k-times-up-usa-gymnastics-team/", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend\u00a0donated $200,000 to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund on behalf of the \u201cheroic gymnasts of the USA Gymnastics Team\"", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fjohn-legend4-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/sports/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-donate-200k-times-up-usa-gymnastics-team/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Donate $200,000 to Time's Up on Behalf of 'Heroic' USA Gymnasts", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend\u00a0donated $200,000 to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund on behalf of the \u201cheroic gymnasts of the USA Gymnastics Team\"", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fjohn-legend4-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
