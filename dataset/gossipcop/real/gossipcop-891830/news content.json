He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program \u201cOn Air With Ryan Seacrest\u201d from Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to put into words what \u2018American Idol\u2019 means to me,\u201d Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it\u2019s allowed me to experience.\u201d\n\nThe show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.\n\nThe glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Show host Ryan Seacrest addresses the audience during the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo\n\nWithin the United States, the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice,\u201d CBS\u2019s \u201cRock Star\u201d, and Fox\u2019s \u201cThe X Factor.\u201d\n\nPop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!\u201d wrote Perry. \u201cAll the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.\u201d", "images":
