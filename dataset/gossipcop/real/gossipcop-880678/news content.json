Here are some of the most talked-about looks of the night.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nNicole Kidman has had plenty of iconic fashion moments \u2014 and this red, tea-length dress with a tie detail at the neck might make the list.\n\nViola Davis\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nViola Davis is never afraid of color, and this Creamsicle-colored dream is a perfect example of why. Has the \"How to Get Away with Murder\" star ever had a misstep? Not that we've ever seen.\n\nShailene Woodley\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\n\"Big Little Lies\" star Shailene Woodley is rocking her new blond hair color and the hottest trend of the season: velvet.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\n\"Black-ish\" star Tracee Ellis Ross is a star who can truly rock the most fashion-forward look. She must have learned her from mom: the legendary Diana Ross!\n\nGina Rodriguez\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nGina Rodriguez is looking red hot in this low-cut and long-sleeved beaded dress.\n\nPadma Lakshmi\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nThis color should be renamed Padma Pink!

And the \"Saturday Night Live\" star owns it!\n\nChrissy Metz\n\nJordan Strauss / AP\n\nThis deep teal color was made for Chrissy Metz! We love how she matched her eye makeup as well.\n\nJessica Biel\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nIs Jessica Biel a Grecian goddess? This draped dress is a dream on \"The Sinner\" star.\n\nZoe Kravitz\n\nMARK RALSTON / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThis fringed and feathered number on \"Big Little Lies\" star Zoe Kravitz is ready to party!\n\nJulianne Hough\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nStuff We Love Get a daily roundup of items that will make your life easier, healthier and more stylish.

The \"Grace and Frankie\" star looks as youthful and fresh as ever \u2014 at 79!\n\nAnna Chlumsky\n\nJordan Strauss / AP\n\nThe awards might be gold, but \"Veep\" star Anna Chlumsky is gorgeous in all silver. This slinky sequined gown has an especially gorgeous ombre bodice.\n\nMandy Moore\n\nMIKE BLAKE / Reuters\n\n\"This is Us\" star Mandy Moore is having quite the year, and it looks like she's enjoying every second of it! This playful black-and-white gown is the perfect way to make a red carpet entrance.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nThe \"Westworld\" star has been open about her love of pants on the red carpet \u2014 and with a suit this good, we have to agree with her.\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nReese Witherspoon produced and starred in the hit HBO series \"Big Little Lies,\" and she's all business in this blazer-inspired minidress on the red carpet.\n\nLea Michele\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nLea Michele looks positively royal in this belted and beaded dress in a deep eggplant purple.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" stars\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images\n\nThe \"Stranger Things\" kids are back \u2014 and stylish as ever! Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin are bonafide stars now and look the part.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown\n\nMIKE BLAKE / Reuters\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, best known for role as Eleven in \"Stranger Things,\" looks beautiful and age appropriate in this ballerina-inspired dress.
