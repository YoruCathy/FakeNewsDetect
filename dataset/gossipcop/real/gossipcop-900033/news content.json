Sometimes saying nothing or very little speaks volumes.\n\n\u201cI will get in so much trouble if I tell you. Nope. I cannot tell you! You\u2019ll have to wait and see next year,\u201d Kim said about her infamous tweet. \u201cPeople think I just say it because I\u2019m being a hater, but I\u2019m just telling you that it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kenya has publicly denied rumors that she has been fired; claiming that she\u2019s one of the \u201cmost relevant\u201d Housewives on the Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\n\u201cI think my storyline speaks for itself, the fact that I\u2019m one of the most Google\u2019d people on the show and, one might say, one of the most relevant,\u201d Kenya told E! News. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone would rush to a judgment to say I wouldn\u2019t be a Housewife. I have the top storyline of the entire season, so that wouldn\u2019t even really make good business sense.\u201d\n\nI have a sneaky suspicion that Kenya may be getting the ax, but part of me is pissed about it because I feel like Kim is getting her way. I\u2019d be curious to know if Kim could have played a role in Kenya getting let go if the rumors are true.\n\nDo you think Kenya had been fired from RHOA? Is Kenya one of the most relevant Housewives on the show? Why do you think Kim is all the sudden keeping her mouth shut? Could Kim be behind Kenya\u2019s firing? Would you rather have Kim or Kenya on RHOA?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-15-at-9.43.29-AM.png?fit=990%2C735&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-80x80.png", "https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/THE-REAL-HOUSEWIVES-OF-ATLANTA-Kenya-Moore.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rhoa-kandiburruss-neneleakes.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/teresa-giudice-1.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jennifer-Aydin.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tamra-braunwyn.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-15-at-9.43.29-AM.png?fit=1148%2C852&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-15-at-9.22.26-AM.png?resize=972%2C302&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sheree-300x168.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bravocon-.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/180716_3762858_Did_Vicki_Gunvalson_Set_Up_Kelly_Dodd_s_Ex_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small-1.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RHONJ-season-10-gia-giudice-frank-catania-ava-tortorici-miss-teen-usa-nj.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-15-at-9.43.29-AM.png?fit=1148%2C852&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/12/15/kim-zolciak-biermann-sounds-off-fired-rhoa-cast-member-scandal/", "title": "Kim Zolciak-Biermann Sounds Off On That Fired RHOA Cast Member Scandal! - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Zolciak-Biermann Sounds Off On That Fired RHOA Cast Member Scandal! - The Real Housewives | News.
