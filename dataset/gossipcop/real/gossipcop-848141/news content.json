How are you doing?\n\nASHLEY GRAHAM I\u2019m so good! I\u2019m so happy to be doing this.\n\nTER Me too! First of all, you\u2019re slaying everybody\u2019s life right now with your fashion. I was spit out of a fashion womb, thanks to momma [Diana Ross]. I\u2019ve been stealing her clothes for a lifetime. My mom was always like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Because she always thought that the costumes were incredibly important and worthy of archiving, but I\u2019ve been explaining to her for many, many years, \u201cMom! Listen, with just your fashion choices in general, you defined an era. These T-shirts are a curated collection!\u201d But that\u2019s not the point. We\u2019re here to talk about you!\n\nAG Who cares! I like being able to talk to you.\n\nTER There\u2019s so much I want to talk to you about! Let\u2019s just dive in. When did you make a decision to love the skin you\u2019re in? Was it something that you found your way to, or was there a particular moment?\n\nAG It would be so much easier to be like, \u201cThis is the date, time, and experience I had,\u201d but there really isn\u2019t one. It was more about experiences in my life of devaluing the fact that I was an average, normal girl living in the city. But being told, \u201cYou\u2019re fat,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re ugly\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re just not good enough,\u201d and trying to live in these model standards, that was my normal. I think I hit bottom around 18. I was disgusted with myself and told my mom I was coming home. And she told me, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not, because you told me that this was what you wanted and I know you\u2019re supposed to do this. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think about your body, because your body is supposed to change somebody\u2019s life.\u201d To this day that sticks with me because I\u2019m here today and I feel that it\u2019s okay to have cellulite.\n\nTER In our culture it\u2019s a big, ugly word, but it\u2019s such a normal part of the human body. As women, we\u2019re taught to see through the eyes of other people instead of our own.\n\nAG I remember my first signs of cellulite, in middle school. I remember telling my mom, \u201cIsn\u2019t it disgusting? It\u2019s so ugly.\u201d She pulled her pants down and said, \u201cLook, I have it, too.\u201d And I was like, \u201cGasp!\u201d She looked at me, then at it, and just rolled her eyes. She didn\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s beautiful or ugly. She just made it a nonissue. It doesn\u2019t define my worth. If women like you and me continue to preach that, then I feel like younger girls are going to grasp it and they\u2019re going to be like, \u201cWho cares!\u201d\n\nTER In high school, I came up with the Jell-O and earthquake test. I\u2019d stomp my foot on the floor while staring, naked, in the mirror so I could watch how long my ass jiggled. If it made me uncomfortable, it meant I had more work to do.\n\nAG I think you have one of the best asses in the industry!\n\nTER Thank you. I never moved into being full-blown anorexic, but that was the sort of tenacious relationship I had with my body growing up. Do you have a mantra you say to yourself when things get tough?\n\nAG Absolutely, I have many. I grew up in a very Christian home, so words have power. I took that with me into every area of my life. If you say, \u201cI\u2019m fat,\u201d that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to feel. If you say, \u201cI\u2019m stupid,\u201d that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to start your day. I wake up sometimes and I feel like the fattest person alive, but I\u2019m not going to let that affect the rest of my day. Say to yourself, \u201cI like this day. I am bold, I am beautiful, and I am brilliant.\u201d For me, that hits the interior, the exterior, and it makes me feel smart.\n\nTER I do the exact same thing! I get clear on what the specific thing is that is frightening me and then I can turn it around into a positive mantra. I keep little white index cards or put it on the home screen of my phone. You want young girls to start with these good thoughts. But I\u2019m 44 and every day is [still] different. How old are you by the way?\n\nAG This year is the big three-oh.\n\nTER I don\u2019t know why people are afraid of getting older. But we should have a conversation about the areas you have to moisturize, and what to do with the armpits as we get older.\n\nAG Should I be moisturizing my armpits?\n\nTER Moisturize them. Talk to them and make sure they should be doing what they\u2019re doing, but do not forget them. Let\u2019s shift gears. How does what\u2019s happening in our country right now connect to your sense of activism and responsibility?\n\nAG I have never had so many political conversations with my girlfriends. If this year has done anything, it\u2019s brought my friendships to a closer level. We\u2019ve been able to get things off our chests and understand things better. We\u2019ve become closer, even just my inner circle. I feel like a lot of American women have gotten closer and tighter and listened to each other more\u2014and been more supportive of each other. It\u2019s not just about the industry we\u2019re in, but the world we\u2019re in. Women have always had a stereotype of being catty or malicious; I think now we\u2019re willing to bring our sisters up and fight for one another. At the end of the day, we just want equality and our rights.\n\nTER It\u2019s a strange time, but I think it\u2019s awakened a lot of people. What are your thoughts on social media? You use it as a wonderful tool.\n\nAG I think there are negative attachments to it as far as the face tuning and flawless face and big round butt and tiny waist. It\u2019s like, We get it. But I honestly think social media has been a really great platform for young adults that haven\u2019t been accepted. If nobody in their small town looks like them or is doing the same things as them, they can find people on the Internet.\n\nTER I agree. It\u2019s a way to connect to a like-minded community, but it can obviously go either way. Who are your role models?\n\nAG Growing up, I idolized Beyonc\u00e9, J-Lo, and the Spice Girls. I was a mix between Ginger and Scary Spice. I wore the Scary buns and Ginger\u2019s slutty, leopard outfits. Today, I have two role models. One of them is my mom. Just seeing how happy she has been going through [life] and how she\u2019s handled every curveball is like, That\u2019s a woman who has integrity and dignity and has been kind and generous to people around her. Business-wise, it\u2019s Kathy Ireland. She\u2019s OG. When she was younger and in Sports Illustrated she was like, I\u2019m going to sell some socks and make a business. Now she has a billion-dollar company. Kathy Ireland, if you\u2019re out there, I\u2019m still trying to be your best friend. You\u2019re on my vision board.\n\nTER Anything you want to say that I didn\u2019t ask about?\n\nAG Buy my book! It\u2019s called A New Model: What Confidence, Beauty, and Power Really Look Like and it comes out May 9th.\n\nON EYES (THROUGHOUT) MAYBELLINE EYE STUDIO COLOR TATTOO LEATHER 24HR CREAM GEL EYESHADOW IN CHOCOLATE SUEDE ON LIPS (THROUGHOUT) MAYBELLINE COLOR SENSATIONAL VIVID MATTE LIQUID IN NUDE THRILL", "images": ["https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/images/search-white.svg", "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Order-v124-300x600-1.jpg", "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/V107_SORRENTI_03.jpg", "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/images/mail.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20773362&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/V107_SORRENTI_01.jpg", "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/images/close.svg", "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/images/search.svg"], "top_img": "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/V107_SORRENTI_03.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Body Beautiful: Ashley Graham Bares All to Tracee Ellis Ross", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 13397230804}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "SjfHn-gKXYNiWsxt47jus1sB0qrasWGaNVwIkC6olDQ", "robots": "noodp", "title": "Body Beautiful: Ashley Graham Bares All to Tracee Ellis Ross | V Magazine", "description": "Ashley Graham strips down in black and white and talks with her friend Tracee Ellis Ross about role models, mothers, and mantras in our summer issue\u2014available to order here.", "keywords": "Ashley Graham, tracee ellis ross, b", "og": {"image": "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/V107_SORRENTI_03.jpg"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/V107_SORRENTI_03.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/res/public/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://vmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
