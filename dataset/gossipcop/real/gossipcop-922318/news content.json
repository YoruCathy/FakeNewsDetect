But his comments about retirement seemed rather more pointed.\n\nStewart was appearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen when a fan called in to ask him what he thought of The Rocket Man's planned retirement.\n\nStewart said: \"I did email her [Elton] and said: 'What, again dear?' And I didn't hear anything back.", "images":
