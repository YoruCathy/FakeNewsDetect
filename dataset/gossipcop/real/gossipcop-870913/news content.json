However, to those who are privy to insider information, fans know that most professional athletes are taking drugs to cope with the stresses of professional athleticism.\n\nDespite the initial controversy that rocked the airwaves, Rodriguez has managed to clear his name in the public\u2019s eye.\n\nHe claimed, \u201cIt starts with being accountable. When people can see that you\u2019re genuine, that\u2019s when they pay attention. You have to own your s\u2013t.\u201d\n\nThe baseball star revealed, \u201cThere were nights in Miami when I was close to tapping out.\u201d\n\nAfter the baseball star played his final game on the 12th of August, Rodriguez has turned his position into one of a sports broadcaster.\n\nAnd not only that but as you all know by now, Alex has been dating Jennifer Lopez for awhile.\n\nWhen talking about his relationship, he said, \u201cWe both appreciate where we are in our lives. We appreciate being a mother and father, and we\u2019re so similar; we\u2019re both workaholics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI left it all on the field. My best two years happened at 19 and as a broken-down 40-year-old. I hadn\u2019t played in two years. I had two hip surgeries, two knee surgeries, and a doping-scandal. If you think about that arc, that tells you a hell of a story, right? The mistakes I\u2019ve made are loud and clear. But one thing I am proud of is: I did not let those mistakes define who I am. I kept getting up.\u201d", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chris-parnell1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Joe-Rogan-Angers-Some-Of-His-Fans-After-Revealing-Hes-Been-Tested-Multiple-Times-For-COVID-19-300x210.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Caitriona-Balfe-Sam-Heughan-Outlander-Actors-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rasheeda-Frost-Kirk-Store-Pressed-Restocked-300x177.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Alex-Rodriguez-and-Jennifer-Lopez-e1501728242173.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1280_garcelle_beauvais_jamie_foxx_GettyImages-171509406-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennier-Lopez-SevenStarsWorld.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-alex-rodriguez-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ayesha-curry-son-jlo-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Alex-Rodriguez-and-Jennifer-Lopez-e1501728242173.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/how-alex-rodriguez-changed-his-life-from-doping-scandals-to-rocking-out-with-jennifer-lopez-56491/", "title": "How Alex Rodriguez Changed His Life From Doping Scandals To Rocking Out With Jennifer Lopez", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "alex rodriguez, jennifer lopez,", "keywords": "celebrity news, alex rodriguez, jennifer lopez,", "description": "In case you missed out on the sports gossip, Alex Rodriguez was involved in a 2014 doping scandal that left his reputation tarnished among those in", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How Alex Rodriguez Changed His Life From Doping Scandals To Rocking Out With Jennifer Lopez", "description": "In case you missed out on the sports gossip, Alex Rodriguez was involved in a 2014 doping scandal that left his reputation tarnished among those in", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/how-alex-rodriguez-changed-his-life-from-doping-scandals-to-rocking-out-with-jennifer-lopez-56491/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Alex-Rodriguez-and-Jennifer-Lopez-e1501728242173.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-02", "modified_time": "2017-08-02", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/bridgethill/", "section": "Sports", "tag": "jennifer lopez"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501603200.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
