Things happen,\u201d DeGeneres told Meyers during his visit to her show Wednesday. Devising a game plan for possible hiccups, DeGeneres instructed Meyers to read the teleprompter, while dealing with various distractions.\n\nPrior to DeGeneres\u2019 test, Meyers revealed that he is somewhat nervous for Sunday night's show, in particular being in front of some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars. \u201cAt least some of them have been on my show \u2026 But you\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t recognize them,\u201d Meyers joked. \u201cI would rather look out into a room full of strangers, as opposed to movie stars.\u201d\n\nThe Late Night host also joked that it would be awkward if he saw a future guest find his Globes jokes not funny. \u201cBecause, they've watched me watch them not crack a smile.\u201d DeGeneres then asked when the host would begin drinking during the ceremony, to which Meyers joked \u201cright after the opening monologue.\u201d\n\nLater on, Meyers revealed that his 2-year-old son is a pro at celebrating Hanukkah after mumbling his own prayer during their family\u2019s candle lighting. Meyers, who is expecting his second child, shared that he and his wife will be having another boy. Explaining that he loves that his son will have a sibling best friend, like he does, Meyers then joked that his feelings could be one-sided. \u201cMy brother doesn\u2019t even say it. He doesn\u2019t care for me at all. I\u2019m clingy.\"", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Annie/unnamed-1.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2018/01/screen_shot_2018-01-03_at_10.50.06_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/01/screen_shot_2018-01-03_at_10.50.06_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/01/screen_shot_2018-01-03_at_10.50.06_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez", "Lexy.Perez Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ellen-degeneres-puts-seth-meyers-awards-show-boot-camp-1071314", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Puts Seth Meyers Through Awards Show Boot Camp", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The 'Late Night' host also shared a story about his 2-year-old son's experience celebrating Hanukkah.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ellen-degeneres-puts-seth-meyers-awards-show-boot-camp-1071314", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Puts Seth Meyers Through Awards Show Boot Camp", "description": "The 'Late Night' host also shared a story about his 2-year-old son's experience celebrating Hanukkah.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/01/screen_shot_2018-01-03_at_10.50.06_am_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Puts Seth Meyers Through Awards Show Boot Camp", "description": "The 'Late Night' host also shared a story about his 2-year-old son's experience celebrating Hanukkah.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ellen-degeneres-puts-seth-meyers-awards-show-boot-camp-1071314", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/01/screen_shot_2018-01-03_at_10.50.06_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Ellen DeGeneres Puts Seth Meyers Through Awards Show Boot Camp", "sailthru.description": "The 'Late Night' host also shared a story about his 2-year-old son's experience celebrating Hanukkah.", "sailthru.author": "Lexy Perez", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-03 11:15:53", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Ellen DeGeneres,Seth Meyers,Golden Globes,Golden Globes 2018,The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514949353.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
