He teared up and gave me the lip \ud83d\ude02,\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\nA few minutes later, Bubby decided to try his luck again, but without much success as his mother took another photograph as evidence.\n\nGrimacing at being caught, Bubby stood in front of his family\u2019s coffee table with a present half unwrapped.\n\n\u201cCaught! This was literally 20 minutes after I posted that lip pic \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02,\u201d James Decker wrote in the caption.\n\nThe singer and her husband, Eric Decker, also share 3\u00bd-year-old daughter Vivianne Rose.
