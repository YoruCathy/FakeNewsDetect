There was no stopping this time. I\u2019d go to sleep, wake up a couple hours later, go at it again, drinking to take the edge off. I remember thinking, \u2018I\u2019m probably not going to make it until tomorrow,\u2019\u201d he recalled, adding, \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018F--k it, I don\u2019t care.
