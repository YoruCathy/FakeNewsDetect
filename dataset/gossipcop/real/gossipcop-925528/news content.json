The dogs\u2014who all donned Mickey Mouse ears for the occasion\u2014spent the day frolicking with their favorite Disney characters, posing in front of Disneyland landmarks and even having a go on some of the rides.\n\nThe Internet, of course, was left swooning over Dog Disney, with many canine enthusiasts taking time to appreciate the delightful photos. \u201cNot to be dramatic but I\u2019m in love with every single dog in this,\u201d wrote one enamored Twitter user. \u201cThey\u2019re such good boys.\u201d\n\nThe dogs are being trained by Canine Companions for Independence, a non-profit that provides assistance dogs free of charge to adults, children, and veterans with disabilities.\n\nSee more photos below.\n\nGet The Brief.
