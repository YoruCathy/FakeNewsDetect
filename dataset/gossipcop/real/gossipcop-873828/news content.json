But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.\n\nSpeaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won\u2019t he play the character for a fifth time.\n\n\u201cI have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I\u2019ve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.\u201d\n\nAsked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some \u201cgood news\u201d about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe revealed he had known for a \u201ccouple of months\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing it, we\u2019ve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.\u201d\n\nHowever, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. \u201cI think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.\n\nEdan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!\n\nHurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR\n\nThe film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather \u201cslit my wrists\u201d than reprise the role.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m over it at the moment. We\u2019re done. All I want to do is move on,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.\u201d\n\nBut explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. \u201cInstead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (\u00a348.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.\n\nSay never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more\n\nNeither \u2013 should they both happen \u2013 will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.\n\nThanks to Craig\u2019s reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. \u201cI\u2019m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I\u2019ve not even played the role,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cEnough is enough. I can\u2019t talk about it any more.\u201d\n\nCraig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the \u201cbest screen Bond to date\u201d.\n\nSkyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015\u2019s Spectre, which was described by the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw as \u201cterrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure\u201d cost $245m to make \u2013 the most expensive Bond film to date \u2013 but was also box office gold, taking in $880m worldwide.\n\nCraig has not been solely negative about the impact playing Bond has had on his life, and said he did not worry about being typecast because the role had \u201cchanged my working life in an incredible way\u201d.\n\ndani \u2728 (@boldlygaying) DANIEL CRAIG CONFIRMED HES BACK AS BOND FOR 2 MORE MOVIES!!!! pic.twitter.com/IbxevPJLZd\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are more opportunities. I could do many, many things. But it takes an awful amount of time. If anything, the restriction is that it is incredibly time-consuming. That\u2019s the restriction.\u201d\n\nThe producers are also rumoured to be determined to bring back Adele to record the theme tune, after her song written for Skyfall became the first 007 theme to win a Grammy and a Golden Globe award.\n\nThe next Bond film, the 25th in the series, is scheduled for release in November 2019.", "images":
