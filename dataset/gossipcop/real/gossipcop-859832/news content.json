The Singer Ditches Her Signature Bangs and Wigs While Strolling Through LAX\n\nMoore narrates the five-minute visual, starring Saldana as an expectant mother who gets diagnosed with HIV.\n\n\"She's about to learn that the HIV is taking over her body, attacking her immune system, and if left untreated, will be passed on to the baby inside her,\" Moore says in the gut-wrenching opening scene.\n\nThe piece follows the mom-to-be's journey from learning of her health status to building her emotional strength (as illustrated by a heartfelt dance sequence choreographed by Ryan Heffington), and giving birth to a healthy baby.\n\nMORE: Sia Releases New Single 'Move Your Body' Weeks After Filing for Divorce\n\nFans will be able to download \"Free Me\" on Friday. All proceeds from the sale of the track will benefit the #endHIV campaign aimed at funding trials for the new e-vaccine that promises to prevent HIV.\n\nWATCH: Stars Align for AIDS Research\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2015-11/640_charlie_sheen_124940528.jpg?itok=HZ2W_101", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/1280set_zoe_saldana_sia_free_me.jpg?itok=23-AiKV_", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-06/1280set_zoe_saldana_sia_free_me.jpg?itok=3XW6CLRM"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/1280set_zoe_saldana_sia_free_me.jpg?itok=23-AiKV_", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Latifah Muhammad"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/music/219283_sia_zoe_saldana_and_julianne_moore_team_up_to_raise_awareness_for_hiv_free_me_music_video_watch", "title": "Sia, Zoe Saldana and Julianne Moore Team Up to Raise Awareness for HIV in 'Free Me' Music Video -- Watch!", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Sia, Zoe Saldana and Julianne Moore Team Up to Raise Awareness for HIV in 'Free Me' Music Video -- Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/music/219283_sia_zoe_saldana_and_julianne_moore_team_up_to_raise_awareness_for_hiv_free_me_music_video_watch", "title": "Sia, Zoe Saldana and Julianne Moore Team Up to Raise Awareness for HIV in 'Free Me' Music Video -- Watch!", "description": "The 41-year old singer debuted a gripping new visual on Thursday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/1280set_zoe_saldana_sia_free_me.jpg?itok=23-AiKV_", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 41-year old singer debuted a gripping new visual on Thursday.", "title": "Sia, Zoe Saldana and Julianne Moore Team Up to Raise Awareness for HIV in 'Free Me' Music Video -- Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Latifah Muhammad", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/music/219283_sia_zoe_saldana_and_julianne_moore_team_up_to_raise_awareness_for_hiv_free_me_music_video_watch", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/1280set_zoe_saldana_sia_free_me.jpg?itok=23-AiKV_"}, "description": "The 41-year old singer debuted a gripping new visual on Thursday.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Music, Zoe Saldana, Sia", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JntzkszLX8?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
