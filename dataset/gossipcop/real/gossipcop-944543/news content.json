Although the star\u2019s life has been filled with different milestones, perhaps the most notable is the birth of her baby boy DJ Isaiah.\n\nEver since she won American Idol at the age of just 17, Jordin\u2019s career has taken off.\n\nBut after years of nonstop working, becoming a mom and taking a break may be what she needed.\n\nSparks now has a very beautiful and happy family alongside her son and husband Dana Isaiah, and she always makes sure to share some of the most memorable moments of her life with her many fans as well.\n\nThe two were introduced by some mutual friends, and the connection was immediate.\n\nAfter her failed relationships with Jason Derulo and then Sage the Gemini, she had pretty much given up on love.\n\n\u2018I had gone through a crazy time last year, so I was just like \u2018You know that? I\u2019m good. I am going to stay single. I am just not going to look.\u2019 It is amazing that that phrase, \u2018When you don\u2019t look for it, that\u2019s when it comes,\u2019\u2019 she shared with People.\n\nThe in love pair eloped in July of 2017 in Hawaii, and just weeks after their wedding, they learned that they were pregnant!\n\nOn Father\u2019s Day, Sparks paid tribute to her man, and it was very sweet: \u2018I knew the moment that I met you that my life was going to change. And it really has in the most beautiful way. Thank you for being the most amazing man I know. For bringing me much light and joy. For making me a Mommy. For constantly building me up and making me better. For loving me and loving DJ.\u2019\n\nThe singer is definitely enjoying motherhood, and she was ready for it even before the birth: \u2018The joy, laughter, scrapes, and bruises\u2026I can\u2019t wait for it all!\u2019\n\nHowever, when it comes to giving her son a sibling, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018No, no. I\u2019m not ready. Nope. I would love for him to grow [up with siblings] because we had siblings. But ask me in like three years,\u2019 she previously told ET.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Oprah-Winfrey-Phil-McGraw-Fauci-300x182.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kourtney-Kardashian-and-Reign-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ashley-Mitchell-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Britney-Spears-justin-timberlake-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nene-leakes-rhoa-season-12-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Kimberly-Guilfoyle-Donald-Trump-Jr-Dating-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jordin-sparks.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Halle-Berry-Dating-Boys-In-The-Past-300x203.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stassi-schroeder-beau-clark-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bernice-Burgos--300x185.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jordin-sparks.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Mitchell", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/all-about-jordin-sparks-happy-life-as-a-mom-and-wife-to-the-most-amazing-husband-161124/", "title": "All About Jordin Sparks\u2019 Happy Life As A Mom And Wife To The \u2018Most Amazing\u2019 Husband", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ashley Mitchell", "news_keywords": "dana isaiah, instagram, jordin sparks,", "keywords": "celebrity news, dana isaiah, instagram, jordin sparks,", "description": "Jordin Sparks is happier than she\u2019s ever been!
