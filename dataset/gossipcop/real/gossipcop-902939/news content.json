In one word: Family.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, the country singer and actress revealed that she and her husband Mike Caussin \u2014 whom she separated from in 2016 and reunited with in 2017 \u2014 renewed their wedding vows in Hawaii earlier this month.\n\nKramer married the former NFL star in 2015; their daughter Jolie was born Jan. 31, 2016. The pair broke it off later that year after reports of Caussin's infidelity, but began rebuilding their marriage slowly in 2017. Based on the lovely picture with the two smiling and gazing deeply into each other's eyes, it appears the pair's steady efforts have paid off.\n\n\"You broke my heart, you broke me down, you made me question everything, but damn did you make me strong,\" Kramer captioned the photo. \"You taught me patience, you taught me family was everything. You made me believe not only in myself but the power of forgiveness. You turned me into the women I always wanted to be. I have NO clue what 2018 has in store for me but I\u2019ve never been more ready to live day by day and enjoy each day as it comes at me. Here\u2019s to always believing in love and fighting for it.\"\n\nThis year has been challenging for Kramer on various levels. On Dec. 9, she revealed on Instagram that she'd suffered a miscarriage.\n\nKramer made her debut on the country music scene in 2013 with \"Why You Wanna\" following her acting tenure on the popular teen drama One Tree Hill in the role of Alex Dupre.\n\n12 Country Breakups We Never Saw Coming", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/michael-caussin-jana-kramer-marriage-update.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/michael-caussin-jana-kramer-marriage-update.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Wendy Hermanson"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/jana-kramer-vow-renewal/", "title": "Jana Kramer Reveals Vow Renewal With Husband", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "The formerly estranged couple have worked hard repairing their marriage, and now can share a triumphant moment at the end of the year.", "keywords": "jana kramer, jana kramer vow renewal, jana kramer mike caussin, jana kramer mike caussin vow renewal", "fb": {"app_id": 193351250697247, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 173910492638623}, "og": {"title": "Jana Kramer Reveals Vow Renewal With Husband", "description": "The formerly estranged couple have worked hard repairing their marriage, and now can share a triumphant moment at the end of the year.", "url": "https://tasteofcountry.com/jana-kramer-vow-renewal/", "site_name": "Taste of Country", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/michael-caussin-jana-kramer-marriage-update.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tasteofcountry"}, "sailthru.description": "The formerly estranged couple have worked hard repairing their marriage, and now can share a triumphant moment at the end of the year.", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-31 17:29:25", "sailthru.title": "Jana Kramer and Husband Michael Caussin Renew Their Vows", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, jana-kramer, country-music-news, country-music-pictures", "sailthru.author": "wendyhermanson", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/michael-caussin-jana-kramer-marriage-update.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/michael-caussin-jana-kramer-marriage-update.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "e19BTQtucrkVk-O5axdlPIIJWMrqGU-QRWcldJZvxnA", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514712565.0, "source": "http://tasteofcountry.com", "summary": ""}
