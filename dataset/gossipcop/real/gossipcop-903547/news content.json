Rogowsky dubbed May the \u201cHQtie\u201d \u2014 a common pet name he uses for the trivia players \u2014 of the year.\n\nOf course, that only made the news better for May. \u201cI\u2019m HQtie of the year,\u201d she said, sobbing, in a separate video. \u201cI love 2018 so much.\u201d\n\nMONEY has reached out to May for an interview.\n\nCertainly winning $11.30 won\u2019t change her life the way larger cash prizes could, but May\u2019s reaction is relatable for other winners of the daily trivia game. Created by the founders of Vine, HQ Trivia is a daily game show on a smartphone app. Everyday at 9 p.m. and every weekday at 3 p.m., players have 10 seconds to respond to each multiple choice question. If they get all 12 questions, they win a portion of the jackpot.\n\nSince launching late last year, the game has gained a significant following, with hundreds of thousands of people playing each round. The cash prizes vary, and everyone who wins a round splits the money.\n\nIn May\u2019s case, her small cash prize likely came as a result of multiple winners and a low jackpot. For others, like Cesar Paolini of Miami, the prizes have been a bit bigger. He won $1,500 \u2014 the entire jackpot \u2014 in a December game after becoming the only winner of that round.\n\nAnd on special occasions, HQ Trivia will make the jackpot upwards of $10,000.\n\nAs for May, winning HQ Trivia despite the small cash prize \u2014 and getting a Twitter shoutout from Rogowsky \u2014 was a successful start to a new year. \u201cGood thing I\u2019m not an emotional person or I\u2019d be overwhelmed,\u201d she tweeted.", "images": ["https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/money2018/img/money-logo.png", "http://time.com/img/navigation/subscribe-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/money2018/img/money-logo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas"], "canonical_link": "https://money.com/you-have-to-see-this-womans-reaction-to-winning-11-30-on-hq-trivia/", "title": "Watch a Woman Lose Her Mind After Winning $11.30 on HQ Trivia", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "hq trivia, hq trivia money, hq trivia twitter, hq trivia app, scott hq trivia, reaction to winning hq trivia, womans reaction to winning $11 on hq trivia, scott rogowsky, scott rogowsky hq,", "news_keywords": "hq trivia, hq trivia money, hq trivia twitter, hq trivia app, scott hq trivia, reaction to winning hq trivia, womans reaction to winning $11 on hq trivia, scott rogowsky, scott rogowsky hq,", "description": "A San Francisco woman won just $11.30 in a recent game of HQ Trivia.
