I\u2019m sorry that this may not be what you want to hear, but it\u2019s our truth.\u201d\n\nThe post continued: \u201cJust know there are no negative feelings here, we are simply two people who believed in love, and were open enough to give it a chance. We still care for each other very deeply.\u201d\n\nAfter asking for privacy, the pair concluded their statement with a thank you to their supporters, writing, \u201cThank you for your understanding and love while we have shared our vulnerability with the world.\u201d\n\nWhile Canadian Beaus\u00e9jour-Savard fell hard for Crawley \u2014 who appeared on Juan Pablo\u2018s season of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and the first two seasons of \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d \u2014 she was infatuated with German contestant Christian Rauch.\n\nCrawley, 36, ended up breaking things off with the distraught Canadian in favor of getting to know Rauch, but that relationship ended up falling apart too.\n\nBeaus\u00e9jour-Savard, 31, didn\u2019t let a little rejection get him down, though. He reached out via text after the show and the duo reconnected. What followed was a surprise engagement \u2014 that included a custom Neil Lane ring \u2014 on \u201cThe Bachelor Winter Games: The World Tells All\u201d reunion show.\n\nThis break-up is the second for a \u201cWinter Games\u201d couple; \u201cBachelor\u201d favorite Ashley Iaconetti and Canadian firefighter Kevin Wendt split in March.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/benoit.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/benoit.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/benoit.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/04/06/bachelor-winter-games-couple-clare-and-benoit-call-off-engagement/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 couple Clare and Benoit call off engagement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
