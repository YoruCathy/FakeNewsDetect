Lindsey Stirling was hospitalized on Sunday, Oct. 29 after suffering a scary rib injury during Dancing With the Stars rehearsals the previous week. But, being the competitor that she is, Lindsey bravely still appeared on the Monday, Oct. 30 Halloween episode despite being in pain.\n\nAnd just a few days after her brave performances with pro partner Mark Ballas, Lindsey gave worried fans an update on her condition. \u201cThank you so much for all your prayers. I don\u2019t know how I made it through this dance. It really was a miracle. Not only was I injured and in a lot of pain but the hardest part to get through was that my spirit was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought that I might have to forfeit, and the thought that this injury might effect my tour was devastating. For the first time in a while, I didn\u2019t believe that I could do it.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI received help from Drs (@humangaragela), I got a blessing from a church leader, I prayed, and I visualized what I couldn\u2019t practice. I basically forced myself to believe I could make it through that dance. Sometimes you have to fake it till you make it.\u201d Luckily, it seems Lindsey and Mark will also appear on tonight\u2019s DWTS episode! \u201cThis week, I am being very careful with how I pace my body and I\u2019m feeling a little stronger every day. I\u2019ve reminded myself why I do what I do and I have my fire back. I believe I can do this and it\u2019s real now. Thank you so much for your support. You guys believe in me even when I doubt myself. Please keep me in your prayers,\u201d Lindsey concluded.\n\nMark also gave fans an update Lindsey\u2019s condition last week. \u201cI am not going to lie \u2014 she is in a bit of pain,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cWe are blessed that the X-ray didn\u2019t show any break or fracture. But definitely some muscle issues in there and she has to rest now, ice it, [and] take care of herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have to bench her a bit this week, we will, but the fact that she got out there tonight was super-impressive,\u201d Mark continued. \u201cAll day she was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to let down the fans, I don\u2019t want to let anybody down, I don\u2019t want to let down my team. I want to go out there and do it.\u2019 I was really impressed \u2014 that was a hard routine to do with a back injury.\u201d\n\nMark, 31, traveled with Lindsey, also 31, to a local hospital after the professional violinist was badly hurt while practicing a \u201crapid dance move\u201d in late October. In the pre-dance segment before their performance last week, Lindsey was seen asking Mark what will happen if she couldn\u2019t perform on the Halloween DWTS episode while breaking down in tears.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely not an ideal day for this to happen, it\u2019s never an ideal day to have an injury. But today is Sunday, it\u2019s the day before we perform\u2026 so this is kind of really nerve-wracking,\u201d Mark said. Lindsey then stated, \u201cI push, push, push all the time\u2026 that\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten to where I\u2019m at but I\u2019m just so afraid that I might\u2019ve pushed too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be so mad if I\u2019ve blown it, we\u2019ve worked so hard\u2026 What happens if they say I can\u2019t go out there tomorrow?\u201d Lindsey asked to which Mark replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll be forced to forfeit\u2026 that\u2019ll be it.\u201d As per the show\u2019s official rules, a celebrity contestant must compete each week to be eligible for the Mirror Ball Trophy. However, pro dancers may skip an episode due to injury or other circumstances and are then replaced by backup pros or troupe dancers.\n\nAfter their high-energy performance last week, the judges (yet again) praised the two for their successful pasadoble. The couple then received 9\u2019s across the board from Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, and Bruno Tonioli, which was three points off from their perfect score the week prior. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but it is all mindset, unless you are just so done that there is no coming back, which I have been in that situation before as well,\u201d Mark shared. \u201cBut the great thing about this show is that we have incredible fans that keep us going. Lindsey wanted to get out there for them and this was so important to her. She is working so hard and she\u2019s got a shot at this. I just want to make sure she is taking care of her body.\u201d\n\nAnd with just a few weeks left before the Mirror Ball Trophy is awarded, Mark and Lindsey are really in it to win it! \u201cWe keep trying to be creative, we keep pushing the boundaries,\u201d he said. \u201cLindsey and I have a great time together. Our chemistry is so fun in rehearsals, we laugh a lot, we\u2019ve just got to make sure that she is healthy now and just keep pushing the envelope and entertaining the fans.\u201d We\u2019re so proud of Lindsey for being such a fighter \u2014 and we can\u2019t wait to see what the couple comes out with tonight!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amber-Laign-and-Robin-Roberts.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/art-carney-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/john-tesh-wife-connie-sellecca03.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dancing-with-the-stars-contestants-net-worth.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10543684k.jpg?crop=518px%2C193px%2C2424px%2C2424px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lindsey-stirling.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_9241936v.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C5347px%2C3028px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lindsey-stirling.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/martin-lawrence-kids.jpg?crop=741px%2C0px%2C2204px%2C2204px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tom-bergeron.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gene-rayburn-match-game.jpg?crop=0px%2C1597px%2C5235px%2C2963px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dancing-with-the-stars-wardrobe-malfunctions-kelly-monaco.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Valerie-Bertinelli-Feature.jpg?crop=160px%2C93px%2C1887px%2C1068px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sunny-hostin-abby-huntsman-the-view.jpg?crop=51px%2C67px%2C3168px%2C1795px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richard-boone-have-gun-will-travel-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C964px%2C546px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-Harry-bothered-by-Prince-William-title.jpg?crop=452px%2C0px%2C3583px%2C3582px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_9728195bk.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C4000px%2C2265px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-William-gets-new-title.jpg?crop=476px%2C0px%2C2875px%2C2875px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lucy-podcast-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lindsey-stirling.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Closer Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/lindsey-stirling-dancing-with-the-stars-hospitalized-injury-145539/", "title": "Lindsey Stirling Gives Dancing With the Stars Fans Update on Her Injury", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "What a tough cookie!
