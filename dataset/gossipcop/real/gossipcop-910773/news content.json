{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/mission-impossible-fallout-tom-cruise-exactly-what-you-missed/", "text": "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout,\u201d the sixth (and best) entry in Tom Cruise\u2019s action franchise, is 147 minutes of relentless action, convoluted and shocking twists and lots of Tom Cruise running.\n\nBetween the stunning fights, chases and helicopter shootouts, you can be forgiven for losing track of the plot, which doesn\u2019t really matter anyway. That\u2019s because \u201cFallout\u201d opens with a giant exposition dump that encourages you to just sit back and have fun; don\u2019t bother trying to make sense of it all.\n\nSo that you don\u2019t have to sweat the small stuff, we\u2019re here to help fill in the blanks.\n\n(SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!)\n\nAlso Read: 'Mission Impossible: Fallout' Film Review: Cruise-ing for Bruising Action in This Jam-Packed Six-Quel\n\nTwo years after Ethan Hunt (Cruise) captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the baddie from \u201cRogue Nation,\u201d Lane\u2019s agents, now known as The Apostles, are running rampant. They\u2019re in pursuit of three plutonium cores to use within portable nuclear devices. Already these stakes are delightfully absurd.\n\nEthan plans to purchase and intercept the plutonium himself, but he loses it when he\u2019s forced to choose between it and the life of his friend and teammate Luther (Ving Rhames).\n\nThe terrorists are working with an agent known only by the alias John Lark, who will rendezvous with a broker called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) to obtain the plutonium and arm the nuclear bombs. Fun Easter Egg: When we first meet the White Widow, she refers to her mom \u201cMax,\u201d who was the arms dealer played by Vanessa Redgrave in the very first \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d film.\n\nAlso Read: Can 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' Ride Critical Acclaim to Box Office Success?\n\nIf there\u2019s one thread that\u2019s been common among all the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movies, it\u2019s that Ethan and the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) are always in need of supervision and oversight from the CIA. In this case, CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) blames Ethan and the IMF for losing the plutonium in the first place, and assigns agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill) to tag along with Ethan.\n\nThe two of them HALO jump out of a plane to sneak into a rave in Paris where Lark and the White Widow plan to meet. Ethan and Walker get in a wall-busting fist fight with the person they suspect could be Lark, leading Ethan to pose as Lark and meet with the White Widow himself. She informs him that in exchange for the plutonium, they need to break Lane out of holding as he\u2019s being moved through Paris.\n\nBut after Ethan meets with the Widow, Walker and Sloan have a private meeting in which Walker accuses Ethan of truly being Lark. The man they killed in Paris was actually a decoy, and Ethan, burned by his government one too many times, might be secretly operating under the IMF\u2019s nose.\n\nAlso Read: Tom Cruise Can't Keep Straight Face After First Line of Jimmy Fallon's 'Mad Lib Theater' (Video)\n\nHere\u2019s where things get really complicated, resulting in one of the franchise\u2019s best exchanges of double-crossing and face mask trickery yet.\n\nAfter capturing Lane, IMF chief Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) shares with Ethan the CIA\u2019s accusation against him and that the White Widow has been an undercover CIA agent the whole time. And Walker is no babysitter, but an assassin tasked with killing Ethan should he go rogue.\n\nWith Ethan now under the microscope, he subdues Hunley and then proceeds to disguise Benji (Simon Pegg) as Lane, planning to hand him over to the terrorists in exchange for the plutonium, leaving Walker alone with the real Lane. It\u2019s here where we learn that Walker, not Ethan, is the real John Lark. (gasp!)\n\nAlso Read: 'Mission: Impossible' - 10 Stunts That Make Us Think Tom Cruise Has a Death Wish (Photos)\n\nWalker starts conspiring with Lane, saying Lane is more interested in getting revenge on Ethan than in setting their plan in motion. But in a bizarre double switch, Walker realizes he\u2019s been duped and realizes it was Benji in a Lane mask the whole time. Rather than just bring in Walker, Sloan double-crosses Hunley and the IMF, and sicks a CIA SWAT team to bring the whole lot of them in. Walker escapes with Lane \u2014 and soon the plutonium \u2014 in the mayhem, and Hunley is killed.\n\nAfter a lengthy foot chase in which Cruise broke his foot performing a stunt, Walker lays a photo of his ex-wife Julia in front of Ethan and explains that he\u2019s her \u201cguardian angel.\u201d \u201cIf I see you again, she\u2019s dead.\u201d Ethan and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) then manage to trace Lane and Walker to a medical camp in a remote part of Kashmir where they plan to set off the bombs, only to find that Julia and her new husband (Wes Bentley, weirdly) are stationed there.\n\nA helicopter chase, a cliff-side brawl and 14 minutes and 59 seconds later, the IMF manage to defuse the bombs, Earth is saved, and everything is right in the world again.\n\nGot all that? Now let\u2019s talk about that bananas skydiving sequence, shall we?", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Mission-Impossible-Collage-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laura-bush-michelle-obama-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/white-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bill-cosby-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Tom-Cruise-on-Jimmy-Fallons-Mad-Lib-Theater-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-52741361-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tom-Cruise-Movies-Ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dwayne-Johnson-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tom-Cruise-Movies-Ranked.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Welk", "Tim Molloy", "Tony Maglio", "Daniel Goldblatt", "Rosemary Rossi", "Trey Williams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/mission-impossible-fallout-tom-cruise-exactly-what-you-missed/", "title": "Here\u2019s Exactly What You Missed in \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019", "meta_data": {"parsely-title": "Here\u2019s Exactly What You Missed in \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/mission-impossible-fallout-tom-cruise-exactly-what-you-missed/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-07-28T14:50:55-07:00", "parsely-section": "movies", "parsely-author": "Brian Welk", "parsely-tags": "alec_baldwin, angela_bassett, christopher_mcquarrie, henry_cavill, mission-impossible-fallout, mission-impossible-6, rebecca-ferguson, sean-harris, tom_cruise, vanessa-kirby, ving_rhames", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "If you got wrapped up in the action and lost track of the plot in Tom Cruise's latest \"Mission: Impossible,\" we've got you covered with this recap.", "news_keywords": "alec baldwin, angela bassett, christopher mcquarrie, henry cavill, mission: impossible -
