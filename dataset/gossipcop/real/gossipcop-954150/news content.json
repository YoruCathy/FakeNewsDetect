Athletes can only receive IVs through hospital treatment under anti-doping regulations.\n\n\u201cA subsequent investigation by USADA, with which Lochte fully cooperated, revealed that Lochte received an intravenous infusion of permitted substances at an infusion clinic in a volume greater than 100 mL in a 12-hour period without a Therapeutic Use Exemption TUE,\u201d the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said in a press release.\n\nThe 12-time Olympic medalist posted a photo of himself getting the IV in May, which prompted the investigation. Lochte was set to race in four events this week at the national championships in California.\n\nThe photo has since-been deleted.\n\nLochte\u2019s suspension began on May 24, 2018 and he'll be eligible to return to the water in July 2019.\n\nIt is the swimmer\u2019s second suspension since the Rio Olympics. He was banned for 10 months after claiming he and three other American swimmers were robbed at gunpoint at the 2016 Games.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/ry0_ovj__400x400.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/0c61872e-lochte.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/270/152/NFL-Ben-Roethlisberger.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/270/152/NBA-Adam-Silver2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/270/152/120315-NFL-Green-Bay-Brett-Favre-sp-80b5ec28858b2510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/0c61872e-lochte.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mekhi-Becton-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/0c61872e-lochte.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
