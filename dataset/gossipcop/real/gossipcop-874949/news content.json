The caption: \u201cTinder profile: Hi I'm Lili. I'm 21, a Virgo, Cali-Girl \ud83d\ude1d And I have cystic acne. Hmu.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ruby Rose Opens Up About Battling Adult Acne In Emotional Instagram Post\n\nLili Reinhart\n\nHer condition, cystic acne, is the most severe form of acne, according to the Mayo Clinic. It happens when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles, causing large, festering bumps under the skin that can't be popped. They're generally caused by hormones and P.acnes, the bacteria that can cause acne. (And it can be painful AF). It sucks, but thankfully, Lili's got a sense of humour about it.\n\nThis isn't the first time Lili has opened up about her cystic acne. Last fall, the 21-year-old shared her skin-care routine on her Instagram stories, including her favourite go-to face mask (which is only $9 on Amazon!) and exfoliating peel.\n\nAnd she's not the only Hollywood star who has this struggle. Kendall Jenner told a fan to \"never let that sh*t stop you!\" after appearing on the Golden Globes red carpet with acne in January. And in a recent Instagram Story, Justin Bieber declared that \"pimples are in\" with a photo of himself with a sprinkle of zits across his forehead.\n\nRELATED: Kendall Jenner Had The Perfect Response When Her Acne Was Attacked At The Golden Globes\n\nIt's refreshing to see a celeb share their not-so-perfect skin on social media (proof that in some ways, they're still just like us). Lili's post is a reminder that acne is a fact of life for many of us\u2014and it's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Women's Health US", "images": ["https://www.womenshealth.com.au/Branding/WomensHealth/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/media/19807/wh0520_cover_cmyk_bws.png?height=158", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgo6e4MgsRr/media/?size=l", "http://www.womenshealth.com.au/media/10524/lili-reinhart.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/Branding/WomensHealth/images/enhanced-header-logo-alt.svg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/Branding/WomensHealth/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.womenshealth.com.au/media/10524/lili-reinhart.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Brophy Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19719179/lili-reinhart-cystic-acne-tinder/", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Lili Reinhart Just Shared A Hilarious Selfie Of Her Cystic Acne", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Kudos for keeping it real.", "news_keywords": "lili reinhart, riverdale, skin, skincare, acne, cystic acne, celebrity", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "Women's Health", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/lili-reinhart-cystic-acne", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Lili Reinhart Just Shared A Hilarious Selfie Of Her Cystic Acne", "description": "Kudos for keeping it real.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.womenshealth.com.au/media/10524/lili-reinhart.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1000}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "womenshealthaus", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Lili Reinhart Just Shared A Hilarious Selfie Of Her Cystic Acne", "description": "Kudos for keeping it real.", "image": "http://www.womenshealth.com.au/media/10524/lili-reinhart.jpg", "url": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/lili-reinhart-cystic-acne"}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 15083547539}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523322719.8, "source": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au", "summary": ""}
