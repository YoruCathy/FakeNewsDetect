No one does it better. \u2014 W\u1ecdl\u00e9 II (@Kingwole) July 14, 2017\n\nBlack Twitter also addressed some of the backlash Queen Bey has gotten from some salty white women:\n\nSo many celebs have debuted their children on magazine covers, etc. for money but Beyonc\u00e9 posts a pic on IG for free and is a narcissist.. pic.twitter.com/rYzcOgPEb6 \u2014 \u2655 A\u0336N\u0336G\u0336E\u0336L\u0336 \u2655 (@IBeenCrowned) July 15, 2017\n\nIt's interesting, white women didn't really start showing their asses in regards to Beyonce until she reaffirmed her blackness with lemonade \u2014 Mike Tr\u00e9 (@TheMikeTre) July 15, 2017\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is NOT a psychopath or narcissist for the photoshoot. Y'all need to stop looking foolish, using psych words you don't understand. \u2014 TheBlackDorianGray (@QueeringPsych) July 14, 2017\n\nWhite women: I wonder what Beyonc\u00e9 is doing at this exact moment. I want to be mad for no good reason at all.
