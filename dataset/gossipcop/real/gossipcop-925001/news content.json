Bryan does not yet have an opponent for next month\u2019s WrestleMania 34, but you better believe Vince McMahon & co. are scrambling to make that happen.\n\nThe undersized Bryan\u2019s in-ring career was shut down two years ago following a series of concussions. Now, he\u2019s got the thumbs-up from numerous neurologists, WWE says.\n\nAlso Read: Charlotte Flair Says Ronda Rousey Signing With WWE Raises 'Everyone's Game' (Video)\n\n\u201cFollowing more than two years of extensive evaluations, WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan has been medically cleared to return to in-ring competition by leading neurosurgeons, neurologists and concussion experts, including Dr. Robert Cantu, Dr. Javier C\u00e1rdenas and Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher,\u201d WWE said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cBryan underwent a full review of his medical history and received comprehensive neurological and physical evaluations independent of WWE. He was cleared by each doctor as well as WWE\u2019s Medical Director, Dr. Joseph Maroon.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: WWE 'Raw': Watch Brock Lesnar Beat the Hell Out of Roman Reigns With a Steel Chair (Video)\n\nTheWrap spoke with Bryan last June about his battle to return to in-ring action. At the time, he was frustrated with WWE\u2019s decision to bench him, but understood executives\u2019 reasons from a liability aspect.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that there is anything the WWE could hear that would change their opinions. The difficulty is in the testing for concussion protocols \u2014 there\u2019s too much liability involved,\u201d he told us at the time. \u201cEverybody agrees that they think my brain is fine now, right? But there\u2019s nothing to say that if something else happens, something bad couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, that kind of liability when it\u2019s a billion dollar company with lots of people who work there \u2014 they don\u2019t want to see that happen to me, with my family. I have a new daughter,\u201d Bryan continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see that happen where there would be a huge lawsuit. That would hurt their ability to employ as many people as they do.\u201d\n\nRead more from our candid interview with Bryan here.\n\nAlso Read: Triple H on Daniel Bryan's Fight to Return to WWE Ring: 'There Will Be No Exceptions'\n\nIn January, we asked WWE Superstar and executive Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque about Bryan\u2019s fight to fight again. The part-time wrestler and EVP of WWE Talent told us the following:\n\nThere can be no exception medically. If the belief is that he\u2019s not healthy enough and there\u2019s a risk [for him] to perform, then I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d allow him to step into the ring unless it can be proven otherwise. There will be no exceptions. We have some of the best medical people in the world that work for us. Our wellness policy, our concussion programming, our protocols \u2014 I\u2019ll put them up there against any on the planet. That is a new science in a way, too. So we\u2019re gonna look at it from all aspects, but the medical experts will make the determination as to whether he can ever step into that ring or not. Look, personally for him, I know it would be something he would love to do, and part of me feels like I hope he has that opportunity. But at the same point in time, he\u2019s married and has a child. Certainly, [we put] the human being first.\n\nAlso Read: WWE's Daniel Bryan on Everything He's Doing to (Possibly) Return to Wrestling Action\n\nSee Bryan tonight on USA Network\u2019s \u201cSmackDown Live,\u201d which airs at 8/7c, and *probably* April 8 at WrestleMania 34 in New Orleans.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SPORTS-100.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Daniel-Bryan-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ric-Flair-WWE-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/WWE-legends.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kid-Rock-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Fabulous-Moolah-WWE-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Daniel-Bryan-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Maglio", "Tim Kenneally"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/daniel-bryan-cleared-wwe-wrestle-wrestlemania-34/", "title": "Daniel Bryan Cleared by WWE to Wrestle", "meta_data": {"parsely-title": "Daniel Bryan Medically Cleared by WWE to Wrestle Again \u2013 Just in Time for WrestleMania 34", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/daniel-bryan-cleared-wwe-wrestle-wrestlemania-34/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-03-20T12:02:50-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Tony Maglio", "parsely-tags": "daniel-bryan, smackdown, smackdown-live, wrestlemania, wrestlemania-34, wwe", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "'SmackDown Live' general manager Daniel Bryan has been medically cleared by WWE to wrestle once again -
