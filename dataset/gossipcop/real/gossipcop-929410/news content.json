Bush was actually funny\u2014and sometimes gleefully imprudent.\n\nOn summer breaks from the White House, Bush loved speeding full-throttle in his twin-engine, V-8 cigarette boat, to the white-knuckled terror of guests at his family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\nAnd though he first bailed out of a cockpit at age 18, as a World War II Navy pilot in the Pacific, old age wouldn\u2019t keep him from jumping out of still more airplanes.\n\nWho can forget the image of a gleeful Bush, celebrating his 90th birthday four years ago with a tandem skydive \u2014 despite being wheelchair-bound and suffering from Parkinson\u2019s?\n\nHis endearing quirks were many. He was fond of colorful socks, the louder the better. In a photo he tweeted in June, he posed alongside Bill Clinton flashing his blue socks bearing his White House successor\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cLuckily I had a fresh laundered pair of @BillClinton socks to mark the occasion,\u201d Bush tweeted.\n\n\u201cI like a colorful sock,\u201d he explained in 2012, in an interview with his granddaughter, TODAY show host Jenna Bush Hager. \u201cI\u2019m a sock man.\u201d\n\nAfter taking office in 1989, Bush banished broccoli from Air Force One and the White House.\n\n\u201cI do not like broccoli,\u201d he famously explained.\n\n\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I\u2019m president of the United States, and I\u2019m not going to eat any more broccoli!\u201d\n\nBush had an earnest, at times cornball, sense of humor.\n\n\u201cDid you hear the one about the duck that went into the bar?\u201d Ellen Warren, the Chicago Tribune\u2019s former White House correspondent, recalled fondly Saturday, describing a memorable clunker.\n\n\u201cBartender looked at the duck and said, \u2018Your pants are down.\u2019\u201d\n\nBush got nothing but vacant stares when he told the joke in 1992 at the Waffle House in Spartanburg, S.C., remembered Warren.\n\n\u201cThe Most Powerful Man on Earth gamely explained: Ducks? Covered in down? Get it?\u201d she wrote.\n\nHis humor was often self-deprecating, but never so much as in 1992, when he invited comedian Dana Carvey to the White House \u2014 to reprise in person his gently mocking Bush impersonation.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/busch.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/home-workout.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/busch.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/knewz_300x250.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/busch.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["December"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/12/01/george-h-w-bush-was-a-pro-at-telling-corny-jokes/", "title": "George H.W.
