And I immediately started sobbing on the plane,\" Kendall said of her hardest day to work over the last 10 years. \"Then I got the next text came through, saying, 'OK, actually, he's OK, but he's not doing well.'

He came to the dinner... I had a bunch of people and Brandon Jennings brought him, and we just connected,\" Khloe recalled. \"It's a serious relationship.\"\n\n\"It's a level five,\" Kourtney interjected. \"[Out of] six.\"\n\nRELATED: Scott Disick Approves of Khloe Kardashian's 'Unbelievable' BF Tristan Thompson\n\nSee more on Khloe's relationship with Thompson in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef&itok=-Hcp3lrf", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef&itok=VBz6vuej", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef&itok=VBz6vuej", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-says-thinking-lamar-odom-had-died-was-most-traumatic-experience-i-was-screaming", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-says-thinking-lamar-odom-had-died-was-most-traumatic-experience-i-was-screaming", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming'", "description": "The reality star also opens up about her relationship with Tristan Thompson in 'KUWTK's 10th Anniversary Special.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef&itok=VBz6vuej", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The reality star also opens up about her relationship with Tristan Thompson in 'KUWTK's 10th Anniversary Special.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-says-thinking-lamar-odom-had-died-was-most-traumatic-experience-i-was-screaming", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef&itok=VBz6vuej"}, "description": "The reality star also opens up about her relationship with Tristan Thompson in 'KUWTK's 10th Anniversary Special.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, TV, Khloe Kardashian, Lamar Odom, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttAvHIMyoHk?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAbMZycURSA?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
