The Puerto Rican singer\u2019s daughter, Mikaela, proved she inherited his star quality and love of music. A sweet video of the 6-year-old dancing to her father\u2019s hit song \u201cEchame La Culpa\u201d has exploded on social media.\n\nThe video \u2014 posted Jan. 2 on Instagram by Fonsi\u2019s wife of three years, Agueda L\u00f3pez, while vacationing in the Dominican Republic \u2014 shows Mikaela and a group of young friends doing choreographed moves to the beat of his smash duet with Demi Lovato while in their bathing suits by the pool. \u201cHey Fonsi!!! #NewDancers #FonsisGirls #TooMuch#EchameLaCulpa,\u201d his wife\u2019s playful caption reads.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nAfter the \u201cDespacito\u201d singer\u2019s busy 2017, which included a European tour, he took a well-deserved break with multiple generations of his clan in the Caribbean.

The musician and Lopez took turns diving into the Hoyo Azul natural spring in Punta Cana. Lopez mesmerized with her fit abs in a tiny black bikini as she leapt into the water in a video posted Jan. 3. The Spanish model also showed off her enviable curves the previous day in a red bikini while holding her son Rocco, who turned 1 on Dec. 20.\n\nThe pop sensations\u2019s crazy work schedule has kept him away from home in Miami more than he would like, he told PEOPLE CHICA last year. \u201cI love my family so much and this year, with all the traveling it\u2019s been really challenging to be apart from them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why when I\u2019m home or they come to where I am at that time, I try to just enjoy every minute\u201d.\n\nThe proud dad of two added that he enjoys his time off with his children. \u201cI love playing with them, taking my daughter to school, watching movies, and [I] hug them to the point they can\u2019t stand me anymore,\u201d he joked. \u201cEverything I do is for them, they are my light and I can\u2019t believe how lucky I am to have them in my life.\u201d\n\nFonsi\u2019s holiday including some male bonding during tee time. The singer shared an image on Jan. 4 with his brother, his dad and brother-in-law also playing golf in Cap Cana, with palm trees and beach in the background. \u201cDoesn\u2019t get better than this,\u201d he wrote.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fluis-fonsi-feature-2000.jpeg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=698&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fluis-fonsi-tout-2000.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=698&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fluis-fonsi-tout-2000.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lena Hansen"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-daughter-dancing-echame-la-culpa/", "title": "WATCH: Luis Fonsi's Daughter Mikaela Dancing to His Hit Song 'Echame La Culpa'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "chica,Chica Celebrity,Luis Fonsi", "news_keywords": "chica,Chica Celebrity,Luis Fonsi", "description": "Watch Luis Fonsi's daughter Mikaela dancing to his song with Demi Lovato, 'Echame la Culpa.'", "og": {"title": "WATCH: Luis Fonsi's Daughter Mikaela Dancing to His Hit Song \"Echame la Culpa\"", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-daughter-dancing-echame-la-culpa/", "description": "For Luis Fonsi, charisma seems to run in the family.
