She looked incredible, and she knew it\u2014and refused to hear anything otherwise.\n\nShe wore the custom Jane Doe Latex dress to present the award for Best Duo alongside her costar, Milo Ventimiglia, and clearly upstaged him:\n\nAnd that was even after she changed into a gorgeous blue dress for the Beauty and the Beast-themed opening number. Changing in and out of latex quickly? That deserves its own award.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut apparently, not everybody was too happy with Metz\u2019s look, and snarked about her size online. But Metz has never had time for body shaming, and always promotes positivity no matter what your size. After the awards show wrapped, she went on Twitter and responded to the body shamers. \u201cFor the record, I wear what I want, when I want,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNews flash it\u2019s MY body. #thankstho.\u201d\n\nFor the record, I wear what I want, when I want. News flash it's\n\nMY body. #thankstho \u2014 Chrissy Metz (@ChrissyMetz) May 8, 2017\n\nThose are words to live by\u2014and hardly the first time she\u2019s spoken out about feeling comfortable in her own skin. \"Size doesn't equate to beauty. I don't understand why that's a thing,\u201d she told Marie Claire back in March. \u201cWell, I do, because the media has told us thin is beautiful. But is it?\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.738xh;0,0.0802xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.738xh;0,0.0802xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Friedman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a9619142/chrissy-metz-mtv-awards-latex-dress/", "title": "Chrissy Metz Does Not Have Time for Any MTV Awards Body Shaming", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Chrissy Metz Does Not Have Time for Any MTV Awards Body Shaming", "description": "\u201cFor the record, I wear what I want, when I want.\"", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a9619142/chrissy-metz-does-not-have-time-for-any-mtv-awards-body-shaming/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.738xh;0,0.0802xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2017-10-06 06:54:47", "published_time": "2017-05-08 01:07:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.738xh;0,0.0802xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Chrissy Metz Wears Latex Dress to MTV Movie and TV Awards, Hits Back at Body Shamers", "description": "\"This Is Us\" star Chrissy Metz rocked a burgundy latex dress to the MTV Movie and TV Awards Sunday night.", "keywords": "chrissy metz, this is us, jane doe latex, latex dress, mtv movie and tv awards, body shaming", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=0.681xw:1.00xh;0.161xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-08T13:07:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.738xh;0,0.0802xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-680133698-1494248471.jpg?crop=0.681xw:1.00xh;0.161xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Chrissy Metz Does Not Have Time for Any MTV Awards Body Shaming", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494176820.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
