The show will not be aired on any Viacom platform.\n\nParamount Network president of development and production Keith Cox told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cWe were going to air in March and hit pause and then had Santa Fe.\u201d\n\nLast month, a 17-year-old shooter killed 10 people and injured 13 more in Texas.\n\n\u201cThis was a very difficult decision. We had multiple meetings, and in the end, we didn\u2019t feel comfortable right now airing the series and I\u2019m not sure when there might be a time that we as a youthful brand at Viacom would feel comfortable,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cThis is a bold move and we stand behind it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Cox and company are trying to find a new home for the show, which is an updated version of the original 1988 film written by Daniel Waters and directed by Michael Lehmann.\n\nYou can follow us on social media at www.twitter.com/HighlightHwd or on Facebook at: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Highlight-Hollywood/193119760769011 , and now on Google+ at: https://plus.google.com/+TommyLightfootGarrett90211/about\n\nWritten By: Tommy Lightfoot Garrett\n\nPhotographs are Courtesy: Paramount TV Network\n\nFollow us on Twitter @HighlightHwd or @LightfootinHwd", "images": ["http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mgid_ao_image_logotv.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/heathers.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1024x759-180118104253-1024-2heathers-paramount.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/facebook-linked_image___tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-720x475.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/151055_0164-h_2019-720x433.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cropped-Untitled-1-4.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Leonardo-dicaprio-gq-uk-june-2016-cover-armani-suit.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/capote-2020-04-16-at-8_13_47-AM-720x475.png", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/got-final-night-king.jpg", "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/taylor-vmas.jpg"], "top_img": "http://highlighthollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/heathers.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://highlighthollywood.com/2018/06/heathers-reboot-pulled-following-sante-fe-high-school-shooting/", "title": "\u2018Heathers\u2019 Reboot Pulled Following Sante Fe High School Shooting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.1.4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "'Heathers' Reboot Pulled Following Sante Fe High School Shooting", "url": "http://highlighthollywood.com/2018/06/heathers-reboot-pulled-following-sante-fe-high-school-shooting/", "description": "Paramount TV network has announced its pulled the show after the Sante Fe High School shooting in May.
