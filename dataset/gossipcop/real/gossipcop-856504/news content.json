Bachelor Nation is back, but at least this time the girl is interesting. Enter Rachel Lindsay. *Spoilers for \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d*\n\nShe is stunning, funny and actually has a real job. (No, she\u2019s not just a \u201cfree spirit.\u201d) The Dallas-based trial attorney seemed sincere as she laughed while dubbing herself \u201csassy yet classy\u201d before nervously kicking off her season of one of the most mocked reality TV series.\n\nOf course season 13 of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d began with flashbacks of Rachel crying over Nick. Like, girl, you dodged a bullet. And we all know it. Then footage of Chris Harrison and the other assholes at ABC surprising our beautiful tropical fish with the first four contests of her upcoming series because nobody could take one more second of \u201chappy couple\u201d Nick and Vanessa [Grimaldi] scowling at each other.\n\nBut then we finally got back to the live footage of Rachel being the every girl as admitted to feeling like she was \u201cin the movie clueless\u201d while pulling onto Rodeo Drive, before allowing an old lady to advise her not to \u201csleep with all of \u2018em.\u201d Aye, aye, grandma!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to focus on the part of my life that I\u2019m just so talented at neglecting,\u201d Rachel pledges. Giiirl. Get off of this terrible reality show and come be my best friend please, because yes.\n\nUgh. But just like that the attention is off of our darling Rachel and onto the horde of testosterone-filled, big-headed men who literally howl from the limousine and endlessly gush about how sexy Rachel is as if it\u2019s a competition and the man with the best cheesy metaphor for her beauty wins her heart.\n\nThe writing for this show is so bad I leave a note for myself that I should be drinking for next week\u2019s viewing. For example, professional wrestler contestant \u201cPretty Boy Pitbull Kenny King,\u201d says something like, \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of rings in my life, maybe the next one that I touch is going to be the one I give you, Rachel.\u201d [Drink]\n\nAlso, why do so many guys watch \u201cThe Bachelor?\u201d Contestants are always saying they fell in love with Bachelorettes while watching them on series of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Does it have that big of a male audience? Are they using it for dating? And if so, should I be watching this season\u2019s castoffs for my future husband and then social media stalking them after their final rose ceremonies? (Looking at you, Blake K.)\n\nOkay. What the fuck is the deal with this Whaboom guy? Because it\u2019s not like Ka-boom \u2013 either the cleaner or the nonprofit that builds playgrounds for children (as seen on \u201cParks and Rec.\u201d). It\u2019s more like a bad, drawn out Jim Carrey impersonation\u2026. and therefore seemingly not at all an occupation? This annoying man child has got to go, which means he\u2019s probably going to be, like, the runner up or something. *sigh*\n\nNot to be a bitch here, but I feel like Rachel is better than a 31-year-old aspiring anything, let alone drummer. Especially one who spends his entire intro talking about his exercise regimen and how (supposedly) impressive his dick is. Hard pass.\n\nFor Diggy all I noted is that he has 575 pairs of sneakers and a bunch of \u201c?!?!?!\u201d because boy, what? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love shoes. But I literally can\u2019t even imagine where that many shoes goes. How big is your house?! I\u2019m getting a headache just thinking about how cluttered a room would look with that many shoes. Or how long it would take to find the pair you want. Unless you have one of those amazing closet computers like Cher in \u201cClueless,\u201d in which case, you\u2019ve pulled me back in. Let\u2019s talk.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve just noted \u201cCORINNE!\u201d The bitch is back! Unfortunately, so were a bunch of other girls I couldn\u2019t remember. I know Raven was one of them, and she\u2019s a sweetheart so she probably wasn\u2019t thinking this, but if it were me I\u2019d be like, hell no am I going back to this goddamn mansion to talk to a \u201cBachelorette\u201d who is not me after I got all the way to the end just to be rejected by that loser on national television.\n\nBut like I said, she\u2019s much nicer than I am. So she joined a bunch of other former contestants to talk Rachel up and give her encouragement before her big night. Then she ran off to get ready and our TV screens were tarnished by Smarmy McFull-of-it Chris Harrison, who stepped out to pretend once again that he was bestowing us with some great blessing instead of just playing host to the bajillionth season of a bad reality show.\n\nThen we saw Peter, who is a \u201cbusiness owner,\u201d which seems questionable \u2014 what kind of business?! \u2014 but he was cute AF and in a plaid suit so I\u2019m unbothered. Josiah seems to think he\u2019s won already since they\u2019re both lawyers, so that made him comfortable enough using lame ass puns like, \u201csee you later, litigator\u201d with reckless abandon.\n\nOne guy did an Urkel impression (what year is it?!) and another literally lugged a giant slab of ice and a huge hammer just so he could \u201cbreak the ice.\u201d Lord help me. Meanwhile, DeMario (whom Rachel had met on the pre-show) was still carrying around his plane tickets to jet off to Vegas with Rachel to elope.\n\nThere was a singer/songwriter, because there always is? I feel like they\u2019re all from Tennessee, too. And was the last one named Lee? I feel like he was. Jack Stone really rubbed me the wrong way because after Rachel said she\u2019d talk to him more inside he gave her crazy eyes and said, \u201cYou better.\u201d Sir, all she \u201cbetter\u201d do in this lifetime is pay taxes and die, so just watch that tone if you want this TV time to launch your startup tie business or whatever you\u2019re here for.\n\nAlso, how many guys are on this show? I feel like I\u2019m back in the theater for the first installment of \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d before I realized it was a three-parter, sitting there like, IS THIS EIGHT HOURS LONG?! This is never going to end.\n\nYou guys, Rachel is TOO NICE. Men are tickling her. They are juggling for her and screaming in her face. And not a side eye to be seen. These produces must have a strict ass contract on her because I\u2019m a people pleaser by nature and even I couldn\u2019t have pulled this shit off.\n\nWait. Jonathan\u2019s occupation is \u201ctickle monster.\u201d A grown man\u2019s occupation is tickle monster. He\u2019s 31, you guys. I can\u2019t with this show. Okay, and now Adam has brought this creepy ass doll (\u201cAdam Jr\u201d) around with him. They have it speaking French to the cameras and literally have Rachel addressing it like it\u2019s a one-on-one. Rachel is better than having to speak alone to a DOLL like some straight to DVD sequel to \u201cThe Boy.\u201d\n\nNow Bryan was a little much for my taste because he was talking about how he was going to be \u201cgood trouble\u201d for Rachel since he\u2019s Colombian, but she seemed into it. And at least he\u2019s a Chiropractor and not some made up, horrifying job like \u201ctickle monster.\u201d And well, during their one-on-one, not only did he tell her that he\u2019s \u201cgood with his hands,\u201d but he fucking WENT FOR IT.\n\nThey tongued like teenagers and if I\u2019m being honest, I was not expecting it. I looked away for one second, and when I looked back, I kid you not, I audibly yelled, \u201cOH SHIT!\u201d at the TV\u2026 alone in my bedroom. Get it, girl.\n\nBryan was the only one Rachel kissed that night, and therefore the one mostly likely to be cocky. But he seemed to have kept his mouth shut. Meanwhile, other guys like Josiah and DeMario seemed pretty certain they were getting that first impression rose.\n\nThese dudes are cocky AF not only about the rose but about Rachel being their wife, for having spoken to her for all of, oh, I don\u2019t know, five minutes. Bachelor Nation is weird, man. Just think if a girl said that in real life. Guys would RUN. But they\u2019re literally arguing over who is going to marry her after basically one interaction.\n\nAnd Blake E. is having a little meltdown because he\u2019s so mad Lucas (Whaboom) is there \u201cfor the wrong reasons.\u201d Like, every interview is about Lucas. You know you\u2019re there to focus on Rachel, right? Blake E. seems like the new Evan. But Chad is waaaay more interesting than Lucas. Sorry not sorry.\n\nNot surprisingly, Bryan gets the first impression rose, and they seal it with another kiss. This prompts all the other guys to flip out, and say insanely narcissistic things like, \u201cMaybe Rachel doesn\u2019t like guys with perfect hair and perfect facial features.\u201d WOW.\n\nFinally, after the sun had come up Rachel did her first rose ceremony, sending home the adorable Blake K., as well as a bunch of other people I\u2019ve already forgotten. However, she did keep the grown man dressed in a penguin suit as well as whaboom guy (Lucas), much to Blake E.\u2019s dismay. Clearly the producers have a big hand in shaping this season.\n\nNow, we already know Rachel ends up engaged, thanks to ABC\u2019s spoilers. So I\u2019m not entirely sure of the point of this show anymore. It\u2019s like \u201cUnREAL\u201d popped \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d bubble and now they\u2019re just admitting that love isn\u2019t real and they\u2019re just all about the fabricated drama.\n\nSo, I guess here\u2019s to drama. And wine. Next week I\u2019ll be watching with wine.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1833586533359519&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sydneywilhelm-262x100.jpg", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sincerelymedia-262x100.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-LYHLZ2G7DVf5j.gif", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kitchen-515388_1920-262x100.jpg", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Bachelorette-Rachel-deserves-better-doll-Entity.png", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Bachelorette-Rachel-deserves-better-kiss-Entity.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-t0psdDzpeVM89.gif", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/noah-buscher-x8ZStukS2PM-unsplash-262x100.jpg", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/entity_v7-entity-gold-bar-for-black.png", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/performance-art-262x100.jpg", "https://media.giphy.com/media/6Nv7BdrUl6Psc/giphy.gif", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kayla-caldwell-entity-288x300.jpg", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Bachelorette-Rachel-deserves-better-Entity-1320x720.png", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/170811_Entity_Sin_Charlie_Last-Day1-2-e1538596089633.jpg", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Entity-Academy-Logo-1.png", "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ENTITY-Logo-Gold-1024x146.png"], "top_img": "https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Bachelorette-Rachel-deserves-better-Entity-1320x720.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.entitymag.com/the-bachelorette-rachel-deserves-better/", "title": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019: Rachel Deserves Better Than These Clowns", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Bachelorette Rachel deserves better.
