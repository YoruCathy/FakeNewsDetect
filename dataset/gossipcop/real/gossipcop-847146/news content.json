Not only that, but sister Jamie Lynn Spears made a surprise appearance, taking part in a performance medley of her older sibling's hits.\n\nJamie Lynn presented Britney with the first-ever Icon Award and joined Kelsea Ballerini, Sofia Carson and Hailee Steinfeld for a medley of \"...Baby One More Time,\" \"Circus\" and \"Till the World Ends.\"\n\n\"What a pleasant surprise, my goodness!\" the older Spears said upon receiving the Icon Award. \"This is such an honor. I want to thank Radio Disney so much for giving me their first-ever Icon Award. What can I say? This is such an honor! Your support throughout my career has meant so much to me.\"\n\nSpears went on to thank her fans, who she called \"the freakin' best,\" and her two sons, Sean Preston, 11, and Jayden James, 10.\n\nBallerini hosted the awards show, which aired on Sunday night (April 30), in addition to the medley of Britney classics. In an earlier interview, the country singer gushed about the pop legend, saying, \"She was also my first concert, she\u2019s a legend.
