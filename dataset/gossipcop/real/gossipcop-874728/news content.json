And no, it doesn\u2019t contain any spoilers from Sunday\u2019s Season 7 finale.\n\nAlso Read: 'Game of Thrones' Director Hints at 'Violent' Fate for Arya or Sansa Stark\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Apple and the adapted series\u2019 executive producer James Corden shared a multi-minute sneak peek of Seth MacFarlane and Ariana Grande\u2019s turn in the SUV, when the duo belted out \u201cSuddenly Seymour\u201d from \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors.\u201d\n\nOh, and they almost got in a car accident \u2014 that\u2019s just a matter of time with this distracting gimmick.\n\nWatch that preview here:\n\n\n\nAlso Read: 'Family Guy' Boss Seth MacFarlane Remembers His Mayor Adam West: 'You're Irreplaceable'\n\nBoth \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d episodes premiere tonight, Aug. 22 at 9 p.m. ET/6
