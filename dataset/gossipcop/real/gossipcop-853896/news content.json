It was 13 years of getting it, and then, one day you get it\u201d and then you start thinking \u2018This is my life\u2019s dream, what am I going to do after this?\u2019 It\u2019s always in the back of your mind,\u201d Moynihan said.\n\n\u201cI knew my contract was ending. I went to LA and went to a meeting,\u201d Moynihan said of jumping to CBS. He remembered thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got to make a decision soon\u201d whether to \u201chang out at the place I love most, or try and become an adult and move on.\u201d\n\nAsked why he left SNL when the show is on fire thanks to Donald Trump, Moynihan said, \u201cI felt like I was on one show for eight years and another for one year. It was a completely different machine last year, took on a whole different level.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get so used to never sleeping and writing all night long, and I made it through eight years of this, thinking this can\u2019t get any worse. And then, all of a sudden Trump happens\u2026With Trump you would come in on Friday and he did something nuts, and we\u2019d have to re-do everything. At times we were doing a brand new cold open on Saturday.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m so thankful I was there for that year. My first episode was the first time Tina [Fey] did Sarah Palin. And I was in the audience for Sean Spicer, when Melissa [McCarthy] did that.\u201d Moynihan called it \u201cthe hardest year easily\u201dof SNL, \u201cbut also, weirdly, maybe deep down one of my favorites. I was glad I got to be there for it.\u201d\n\nWritten by Dan Kopelman, Me, Myself & I examines one man\u2019s life over a 50-year span. The show will focus on three distinct periods in Alex Riley\u2019s life: as a 14-year-old in 1991 (Jack Dylan), a 40-year-old in present day (Moynihan), and a 65-year-old in 2042 (John Larroquette).\n\nEP Dan Kopelman said he never considered having Moynihan play the two adult roles. \u201cIt was always going to be three actors playing the same role and get the best actors for the role and trust that the audience is going to go along for the ride.\n\nLaroquette being much taller than Moynihan, \u201cin the future scenes we tried to surround [Laroquette] with taller people so he is not towering over them.\u201d But Moynihan and Larroquette are never seen together on screen, Kopelman reminded. \u201cIf we do our job right, you\u2019re going to go along for the ride.\u201d", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2017%2F08%2Fbobby-moynihan-leaves-saturday-night-live-me-myself-i-growing-up-tca-1202139996%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202139996&comment_count=3", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa De Moraes"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan-leaves-saturday-night-live-me-myself-i-growing-up-tca-1202139996/", "title": "Bobby Moynihan: Leaving \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 For \u2018Me, Myself & I\u2019 About \u201cBecoming An Adult And Moving On\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Bobby Moynihan came to TCA to talk about his new comedy \"Me, Myself &amp; I,\" but, understandably, took a lot of \"SNL\" questions.", "news_keywords": "bobby moynihan, CBS, Me Myself & I, TCA, TCA", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bobby Moynihan: Leaving \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 For \u2018Me, Myself & I\u2019 About \u201cBecoming An Adult And Moving On\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan-leaves-saturday-night-live-me-myself-i-growing-up-tca-1202139996/", "description": "Bobby Moynihan came to TCA to talk about his new CBS comedy Me, Myself & I, but, understandably, took a lot of Saturday Night Live questions. \u201cI\u2019m an unabashed fan of SNL and would have s\u2026", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1200, "height": 768}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-01T17:26:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-01T19:58:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Deadline", "text": {"title": "Bobby Moynihan: Leaving \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 For \u2018Me, Myself & I\u2019 About \u201cBecoming An Adult And Moving On\u201d"}, "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan.jpg?w=1024", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bobby Moynihan: Leaving \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 For \u2018Me, Myself & I\u2019 About \u201cBecoming An Adult And Moving On\u201d", "description": "Bobby Moynihan came to TCA to talk about his new comedy \"Me, Myself & I,\" but, understandably, took a lot of \"SNL\" questions."}, "author": "Lisa de Moraes", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202139996, "title": "Bobby Moynihan: Leaving 'Saturday Night Live' For 'Me, Myself & I' About \"Becoming An Adult And Moving On\"", "published_at": "2017-08-01 10:26:13", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bobby-moynihan.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1", "comment_count": 3, "tags": "TCA", "topics": "TV", "body": "Bobby Moynihan came to TCA to talk about his new CBS comedy Me, Myself & I, but, understandably, took a lot of Saturday Night Live questions.\r\n\r\n\"I\u2019m an unabashed fan of SNL and would have stayed there forever and ever,\" Moynihan acknowledged. \"The day you get SNL you start worrying about your exit from SNL; it was always on my mind.
