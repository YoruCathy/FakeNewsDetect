Hide their embarrassing baby pics? Tell them they\u2019re loved?\n\nFor Cindy Crawford\u2019s 18-year-old son, Presley Gerber, the answer is found in the ink. On Thursday, Presley shared an Instagram photo of a brand-new tattoo on his body. To many of his followers' suprise, the arm tat was dedicated to his younger sister, 16-year-old model sister Kaia Gerber. Her first name in a slim script above the number 23 written in Roman numerals are visible on his left tricep:\n\nView this post on Instagram 23 A post shared by Presley (@presleygerber) on Feb 15, 2018 at 3:23pm PST\n\nGerber turned to celebrity-favorite tattoo artist Jon Boy (Kendall Jenner and Hailey Baldwin are clients) for the new piece of art, and Kaia was apparently there to watch him do it during New York Fashion Week, according to Jon Boy\u2019s Instagram.\n\nOn Instagram Stories, Kaia wrote \u201cbest big bro ever\u201d along with the same photo Presley shared, so she clearly likes the piece in her honor. While we\u2019re not sure what the number \u201c23\u201d could stand for, we do know one thing: fans have mixed feelings about the piece.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a sweet gesture for Presley to recognize his love for his sister in such a permanent way, but not everyone feels this way. In the comments, some fans expressed their opinion, writing, \u201cweird af but ok\u201d and \u201comg wtf\u201d while others quickly came to his defense, explaining that they too have tattoos of their siblings\u2019 names.\n\nRELATED: Quiz\u2014How Well Do You Know Celebrity Tattoos?\n\n\u201cDon't judge him because he decided to do something for her sister, you can make an opinion but that opinion doesn't have to hurt; so if you say \"How can anyone tattoo their sister's name\" you are kind of laughing at them, I don't know I would do that for my brother, but if he did, I look up to him for the great capacity of love he has,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nTattooing the names of close family members isn\u2019t really all that bizarre. Drew Barrymore, for instance, has the names of her daughters Olive and Frankie on her wrist (below), while Angelina Jolie has seven geographical coordinates on her left bicep (they represent the location where each of her children was born). Sisters Tia and Tamerya Mowry have a tattoo of the word \u201cJumelles\u201d on their wrists, which means twins in French.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F09%2F092517-kaia-and-presley-gerber_0.jpg%3Fitok%3D-qcQZSbb"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F09%2F092517-kaia-and-presley-gerber_0.jpg%3Fitok%3D-qcQZSbb", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Borge"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/presley-gerber-tattoo-sister-kaia-name", "title": "Kaia Gerber's Brother Presley Got a Tattoo of Her Name and People Have Mixed Feelings", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celebrity,News,latest,Tattoos,Social Media,Kaia Gerber", "news_keywords": "presley gerber new tattoo, cindy crawfords son, kaia gerber modeling, cindy crawford and kaia gerber, presley gerber and kaia calvin klein, presley gerber 23, kaia gerber 23, presley kaia 23 meaning", "description": "The 18-year-old son of Cindy Crawford got a new tattoo to honor his little sister, Kaia.
