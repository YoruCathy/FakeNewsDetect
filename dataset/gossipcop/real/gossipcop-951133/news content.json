As Pitta recounted the scene, \u201cI just casually said, \u2018Another comedian I know has a service dog. The dog wakes her up when she chokes in her sleep.\u2019 And Robin instantly said, \u2018Oh, a Heimlich retriever.\u2019 It got a huge laugh. He just sat there and had a little smile on his face.\u201d When he and Robin left the theater at the end of the evening, Pitta said, \u201cI gave him a hug and I said goodbye. He said goodbye to me three times that night. And he said it exactly the same way. He goes, \u2018Take care, Marky.\u2019 He said it three times.\u201d\n\nOne evening in early August, Robin made one of his intermittent visits to Zak and Alex\u2019s house in San Francisco, as he did when Susan was out of town. This time she happened to be in Lake Tahoe, and Robin showed up to see his son and daughter-in-law like a meek teenager who realizes he\u2019s stayed out past his curfew; he was always welcome there, but he carried himself with mild discomfort, as if he still needed someone else\u2019s permission to be in their home. At the end of the night, as Robin was preparing to head back to Tiburon, Zak and Alex asked him what it would take to keep him at their house\u2014would they have to tie him up and throw a bag over him?\n\n\u201cWell, that was a joke,\u201d Zak said with a bittersweet laugh. \u201cTo be clear, that was a joke. But we didn\u2019t want someone who seemed like he was in so much anguish to leave. We wanted him to stay with us. We wanted to take care of him.\u201d\n\nOn the night of August 10, a Sunday, Robin and Susan were home together in Tiburon when Robin began to fixate on some of the designer wristwatches that he owned and grew fearful that they were in danger of being stolen. He took several of them and stuffed them in a sock, and, at around 7 P.M., he drove over to Rebecca and Dan Spencer\u2019s house in Corte Madera, about two and a half miles away, to give them the watches for safekeeping. After Robin came home, Susan started getting ready for bed; he affectionately offered her a foot massage, but on this night, she said she was O.K. and thanked him anyway. \u201cAs we always did, we said to each other, \u2018Good night, my love,\u2019 \u201d Susan recalled.\n\nRobin went in and out of their bedroom several times, rummaged through its closet, and eventually left with an iPad to do some reading, which Susan interpreted as a good sign; it had been months since she\u2019d seen him read or even watch TV. \u201cHe seemed like he was doing better, like he was on the path of something,\u201d she later said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018O.K., stuff is working. The medication, he\u2019s getting sleep.\u2019\u201d She saw him leave the room at around 10:30 P.M. and head to the separate bedroom he slept in, which was down a long hallway on the opposite side of their house.\n\nWhen Susan woke up the next morning, Monday, August 11, she noticed that the door to Robin\u2019s bedroom was still closed, but she felt relieved that he was finally getting some needed rest. Rebecca and Dan came over to the house, and Rebecca asked how the weekend had gone with Robin; Susan optimistically answered, \u201cI think he\u2019s getting better.\u201d Susan had been planning to wait for Robin to wake up so that she could meditate with him, but when he wasn\u2019t awake by 10:30 A.M., she left the house to run some errands.\n\nBy 11 A.M., Rebecca and Dan were concerned that Robin still had not come out of his room. Rebecca slipped a note under the door of Robin\u2019s bedroom to ask if he was O.K. but received no response. At 11:42 A.M., Rebecca texted Susan to say she was going to wake Robin up, and Dan went to find a step stool to try to look through his bedroom window from the outside of the house. In the meantime, Rebecca used a paper clip to force open the lock to the bedroom door. She entered the room and made a horrifying discovery: Robin had hanged himself with a belt and was dead.\n\nExcerpted from Robin by Dave Itzkoff.
