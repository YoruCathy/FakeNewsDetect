Indeed, the first half of the show frequently returned to the many sexual misconduct scandals roiling powerful men and the institutions that once protected them \u2014 including Senator Al Franken, the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d alumnus who said on Thursday that he would resign his seat as he faced allegations from at least six women of groping and improper advances.\n\nThe show\u2019s pointed and effective opening sketch, which featured Kenan Thompson as the would-be Santa and Kate McKinnon as his elfin assistant, began with a boy asking Mr. Thompson for traditional gifts like Mega Bloks and Lazer Tag.\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d the boy added, \u201ccan you tell me, what did Al Franken do?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson was understandably taken aback. \u201cO.K., wow, let\u2019s see,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I can handle the Mega Bloks and the Lazer Tag.
