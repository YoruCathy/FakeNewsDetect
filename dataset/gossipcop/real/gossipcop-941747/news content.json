She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cHug your loved ones extra tight today.\u201d\n\nAfter Brosnahan won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a television series, musical or comedy for her work in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in January, Kate told Page Six that the family was \u201cinsanely proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am beside myself! My daughter and I jumped up and down when she won,\u201d the beloved handbag creator said. \u201cShe deserves this recognition, as she\u2019s put her heart and soul into the role. We are insanely proud.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kate Spade and Rachel Brosnahan Walter McBride/Getty\n\nPolice confirmed Kate was found Tuesday morning in her bedroom at her and Andy\u2019s Park Avenue home in Manhattan.
