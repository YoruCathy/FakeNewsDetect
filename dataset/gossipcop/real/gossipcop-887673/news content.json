Every part has been a stretch\u2014the type of stretch that incites critics to wonder aloud, \u201cEr, can Zac Efron do [X]?,\u201d that is: \u201cCan Zac Efron believably hang out with Orson Welles in the 1930s?\u201d \u201cCan Zac Efron be trusted to headline a beloved Dr. Seuss classic?\u201d \u201cCan Zac Efron convincingly play an angsty race-car-driver-cum-farmer-cum-son-of-Dennis-Quaid?\u201d And, again, coming up Friday, there\u2019s We Are Your Friends, starring Efron as a young man who wants nothing more from life than to mash up house tracks for college students rolling on ecstasy. \u201cCan Zac Efron make us care about D.J.s?\u201d\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is yes, even when it's technically no. Because Zac Efron can make us care about anything, even if that thing is terrible.\n\nHe is wildly attractive and desperately charming, but also, somehow, extremely attainable in an Old-Hollywood-meets-New-Jersey way that makes you (the royal you, but also me) feel like he is going to sweep you off your feet, carry you up a winding staircase, make enthusiastic love to you in his four-poster bed, then order pizza and play Call of Duty with you and wink at you when you have a particularly clutch kill. He is the Everyman and Superman at the same time. It\u2019s a quality his That Awkward Moment co-star Miles Teller described as follows: \u201cWith the right lighting, that movie star thing happens. It\u2019s like a falling star just happened in his eyes.\u201d It\u2019s a quality that made Matt Lauer blush and giggle and write off that aforementioned red-carpet condom drop as a safe-sex promo. It\u2019s a quality that made it impossible for Seth Rogen to hate him, even though Seth Rogen really, really wanted to hate him, but instead went ahead and cast him as his co-star in Neighbors (and in the upcoming sequel). It\u2019s a quality that made us all forget about that time he got into a \u201ctussle\u201d with a homeless dude.\n\nWe love Efron because he\u2019s got the bone structure of an Italian statue but the palpable confusion of an Italian tourist; because he\u2019s a walking contradiction. In other words, he\u2019s just a human. He\u2019s us. What better proof than the fact that Efron prefers playing characters who are trying to improve, who just want to break free? \u201cI\u2019m constantly searching for characters that are about betterment of self and betterment of others,\u201d he told T.H.R. \u201cAnd I\u2019m searching for those parts because those are the ones that make me happy. They\u2019re the ones that fulfill me personally.\u201d\n\nSo, in the spirit of infinite chances, let\u2019s say this about Efron\u2019s next attempt to keep his head above water: We Are Your Friends may be a bad film, but it could also be his last one, the true start of something new. With a sequel to Neighbors, a spring-break movie with Robert De Niro, and a Baywatch movie with The Rock on the way, his upcoming work is targeted at a frat-bro audience, but with a prestige that seems purposeful. And it cannot be a coincidence that the year of We Are Your Friends is also the year that Efron engaged in the act of, as he put it, \u201cTaking over my social. Get ready.\u201d (This means that previous tweets and Instagrams\u2014including this one and this one\u2014were posted by his shills in hopes of shaping an image that had been fractured many times over.) Is there any better proof that Zac Efron is taking ownership of his career than the fact that he\u2019s finally confident enough to star exclusively in films that see him shirtless throughout and to post his own heavily filtered photos?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know for sure where We Are Your Friends will take Efron, but what I do know is that we\u2019ll all be there, watching, waiting, as he valiantly tries to re-invent himself yet again. Because we are your friends, Zac. We\u2019re all in this together.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/53d7e6b3f447d4ab3b000649/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/zb_wormfeeds.gif", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/53d7e670a923ddc66900064f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/zb_parachute.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/53d7e8c1f447d4ab3b00064a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/zb_firsthighfive.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4ed6c169027501c6fa598/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/zac-efron-we-are-your-friends.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Handler", "Rachel Handle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/zac-efron-we-are-your-friends", "title": "Why We Keep Loving Zac Efron, No Matter How Many Times He Fails", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Rachel Handler", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Whether or not We Are Your Friends is a hit, it fits the narrative that has made Efron\u2019s career a success, even when it doesn\u2019t seem to be.", "id": "55d4d10d8fbf768838dcfa58", "keywords": "movies,zac efron,we are your friends", "news_keywords": "movies,zac efron,we are your friends", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "55d4d10d8fbf768838dcfa58", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Whether or not We Are Your Friends is a hit, it fits the narrative that has made Efron\u2019s career a success, even when it doesn\u2019t seem to be.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Whether or not We Are Your Friends is a hit, it fits the narrative that has made Efron\u2019s career a success, even when it doesn\u2019t seem to be.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Why We Keep Loving Zac Efron, No Matter How Many Times He Fails", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/zac-efron-we-are-your-friends"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Whether or not We Are Your Friends is a hit, it fits the narrative that has made Efron\u2019s career a success, even when it doesn\u2019t seem to be.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55d4cfb5169027501c6fa14d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/zac-efron-high-school-musical-paper-boy-we-are-your-friends.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Why We Keep Loving Zac Efron, No Matter How Many Times He Fails"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
