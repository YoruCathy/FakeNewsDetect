Remini, known for the hit sitcom \u201cKing of Queens,\u201d was a devout Scientologist for 35 years before she left the church in 2013. She has been an outspoken critic ever since, although it is extremely rare for anyone to criticize Scientology after they leave. Here\u2019s her history of calling out the church:\n\n(For the record, the church has called Remini an \u201cobnoxious, spiteful ex-Scientologist\u201d and claims the actress is bitter that she was expelled for unethical conduct; it also disputes many statements made in the A&E show. Church officials say that Remini is trying to \u201cdistort the truth\u201d about Scientology and that she\u2019s \u201cdoing [the show] for the money and now tries to pretend otherwise.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJuly 2013: Page Six confirms that Remini, who rose to very high levels in the organization once she became a star and donated millions, has left Scientology. A Remini \u201csource\u201d says the actress was \u201cput through interrogations and blacklisted within the church\u201d when she started to question leader David Miscavige, particularly the whereabouts of his wife, Shelly, who reportedly hasn\u2019t been seen in public since 2007.\n\nRemini said she also disagreed with the church\u2019s policies that restrict members from talking to relatives who criticize the church, a practice known as \u201cdisconnecting.\u201d \u201cShe is stepping back from a regime she thinks is corrupt. She thinks no religion should tear apart a family or abuse someone under the umbrella of \u2018religion,\u2019 \u201d the source says.\n\nLater that month, Remini echoes this sentiment to People magazine. \u201cI believe that people should be able to question things. I believe that people should value family, and value friendships, and hold those things sacrosanct,\u201d she says. \u201cThat for me, that\u2019s what I\u2019m about. It wouldn\u2019t matter what it was, simply because no one is going to tell me how I need to think, no one is going to tell me who I can, and cannot, talk to.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAugust 2013: Remini files a missing-person report for Shelly Miscavige, which the Los Angeles Police Department calls \u201cunfounded.\u201d The church says it\u2019s \u201cill-advised, ludicrous self-promotion\u201d on Remini\u2019s part.\n\nSeptember 2013: Remini joins the cast of \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d where she lands in fifth place. During one episode, she tells her partner, Tony Dovolani, that she hoped the show would help her move on. \u201cThe church is looking for me to fail so they can say to their parishioners, \u2018You see what happens when you leave the church?\u2019 They\u2019re waiting for me to fail,\u201d Remini says.\n\nFebruary 2014: Remini tells Buzzfeed that she quit Scientology because her young daughter was getting closer to the age of getting \u201cacclimated\u201d in it and would have to sit for audits, where members divulge personal information. Plus, Remini thought Scientology was taking over her life. \u201cI was spending most of my time at the Church,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I was saying \u2018family first,\u2019 but I wasn\u2019t showing that. I didn\u2019t like the message that sent my daughter.\u201d (Scientology officials call Remini\u2019s statements \u201cabsurd, insulting and motivated entirely by a desire to grab attention.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMarch 2015: Alex Gibney\u2019s \u201cGoing Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\u201d documentary airs on HBO, featuring multiple ex-members telling horror stories about their time in the organization. Remini tweets her praise: \u201cThank you to the brave who did something about it. And to those who didn\u2019t have a voice, you do now.\u201d\n\nMay 2015: Remini sits for an interview with Oprah Winfrey in \u201cOprah: Where Are They Now?\u201d and talks about how painful it was to leave friends behind in the church. \u201cI\u2019m learning there\u2019s a new world out here and there shouldn\u2019t be any kind of judgment toward somebody who has a belief system that is not yours,\u201d she says.\n\nJuly 2015: The second and final season of her TLC reality show, \u201cLeah Remini: It\u2019s All Relative,\u201d premieres, and Remini talks more about how she left to protect her daughter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOctober 2015: Remini writes a book, \u201cTroublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology,\u201d and promotes it with an in-depth interview on \u201c20/20,\u201d reiterating her previous claims and saying she didn\u2019t want want to be \u201cdisconnected\u201d from her daughter.\n\nNovember 2015: Remini\u2019s book is released, and she spills lots of dirt, including tales of Scientology superstar Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u2019s wedding weekend, which is where her relationship with the church started to go downhill after Remini was accused of behaving badly. The church\u2019s response? Remini is \u201cpathetically exploiting her former religion, her former friends and other celebrities for money and attention to appear relevant again.\u201d\n\nDecember 2015: According to her show on A&E, Remini starts to get lots of requests for help from people who still have family members in the church. She captures one story on video of a family torn apart by Scientology, and decides to develop a show.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNovember 2016: \u201cLeah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath\u201d premieres on A&E, chronicling Remini\u2019s past and the stories of former members, who allege physical and sexual abuse. (Scientology officials say all of them are lying.)\n\n\u201cI want to give a voice to these stories,\u201d Remini says in the show, \u201cenough that people will be incensed by it to put some pressure on this organization to stop abusing people.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rpMMAByuvXo5luT3NSQsGt6ze_A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWLV77KLV46MDCKG6DM6EIH6DA.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWLV77KLV46MDCKG6DM6EIH6DA.jpg&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rpMMAByuvXo5luT3NSQsGt6ze_A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWLV77KLV46MDCKG6DM6EIH6DA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/01/leah-reminis-long-history-of-calling-out-the-church-of-scientology/", "title": "Leah Remini\u2019s long history of calling out the Church of Scientology", "meta_data": {"description": "It all culminated in this week's A&E docuseries, in which Remini says she will expose \"shocking stories of abuse, heartbreak and harassment.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/12/01/leah-reminis-long-history-of-calling-out-the-church-of-scientology/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rpMMAByuvXo5luT3NSQsGt6ze_A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWLV77KLV46MDCKG6DM6EIH6DA.jpg", "title": "Leah Remini\u2019s long history of calling out the Church of Scientology", "description": "It all culminated in this week's A&E docuseries, in which Remini says she will expose \"shocking stories of abuse, heartbreak and harassment.\""}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Leah Remini\u2019s long history of calling out the Church of Scientology", "description": "It all culminated in this week's A&E docuseries, in which Remini says she will expose \"shocking stories of abuse, heartbreak and harassment.\""}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-21T22:24:02.542Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1480521600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
