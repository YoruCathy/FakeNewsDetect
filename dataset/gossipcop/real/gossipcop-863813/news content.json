ABC News\n\nChris Cornell, 52, was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on May 18. His death was ruled an apparent suicide, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nMedical reports note that though seven different drugs were found in his system, these were not a contributing factor to his death.\n\nVicky Cornell, and others in the medical community, however, argue that there is more to the story.\n\nChris Cornell and family attend the New York Screening of \"The Promise\" at The Paris Theatre in New York City, April 18, 2017.

He loved his life,\" Vicky Cornell said. \u201cI don't think that he could make any decisions because of the level of impairment.\u201d\n\nDr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy, told ABC News that two drugs found in his system at the time of his death may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions.\n\n\"They were not at levels that would\u2019ve caused his death; in other words, it wasn\u2019t an overdose,\" Cote said. \"But what the two drugs did individually and in combination was to really impair his judgment and make him psychically unable to be responsive in ways that he normally would be responsive.\"\n\n'There were signs\u2019\n\nVicky Cornell recalled the year before her husband\u2019s death, when she said he fell back into addiction after being sober since 2003.\n\n\u201cApproximately a year before he died, he was prescribed a benzodiazepine to help him sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had torn his shoulder \u2026 the pain in the shoulder was waking him up at night and it was keeping him up.\u201d\n\nChris Cornell of Soundgarden performs during the Pemberton Music and Arts Festival, July 18, 2014, in Pemberton, British Columbia.

ABC News\n\nVicky Cornell said her memories of the night her husband died still weigh heavily on her.\n\n\u201cI know that people say ... you can't blame yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm trying not to, but there were signs.\u201d\n\n'You think addiction is a choice, and it's not'\n\nShe said she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic.\n\n\u201cPeople think that addiction is like, \u2018Oh, you were an addict,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t recognize it as a disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think addiction is a choice, and it's not,\u201d she added. \"I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up.\"\n\nShe added that addiction has now \"crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere.\"\n\n\u201cMy husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie. He just wasn't,\" she said. \"He was the best husband, the greatest father. I lost my soulmate and the love of my life.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/chris-cornell-family-02-gty-mt-180220_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/chris-cornell-family-02-gty-mt-180220_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Catherine Thorbecke", "February", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/chris-cornells-widow-battle-addiction-led-suicide-loved-53228245", "title": "Chris Cornell's widow says his battle with addiction led to his suicide: 'He loved his life'", "meta_data": {"description": "\"He wanted to be there for his family,\" Vicky Cornell said.", "keywords": "Chris Cornell, Vicky Cornell, suicide, addiction", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
