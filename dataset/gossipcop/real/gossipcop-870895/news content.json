They\u2019ve made so many sacrifices throughout their 33 years of marriage just to see us happy.\u201d\n\nThe star detailed all the extra work his immigrant parents put into raising their kids, which included both parents working two jobs. His mother worked as a housekeeper at Disney and an overnight cashier at Walgreens, while his father worked in maintenance and as a cashier at Burger King at night.\n\n\u201cGrowing up I never needed anything, I had presents under the tree, food on the table and a roof over my head,\u201d James says. \u201cThey did such a marvelous job of raising us, without us ever knowing their daily struggles.\u201d\n\nA post shared by LeJuan James (@lejuanjames) on Aug 1, 2017 at 6:55pm PDT\n\nWatch the incredibly emotional surprise play out in the video above.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5845c9201800002c00e40fe1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598387761500007d208b4faa.png?ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d3cdd1700001600b065cf.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598387761500007d208b4faa.png?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/youll-cry-after-watching-lejuan-james-surprise-his-parents-with-a-new-home_n_598382f9e4b0cb15b1bd6e31", "title": "You'll Cry After Watching LeJuan James Surprise His Parents With A New Home", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Don't even try to fight the tears.", "keywords": "Arts and Entertainment,Social Media,latino", "og": {"title": "You'll Cry After Watching LeJuan James Surprise His Parents With A New Home", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598387761500007d208b4faa.png?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598387761500007d208b4faa.png?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/youll-cry-after-watching-lejuan-james-surprise-his-parents-with-a-new-home_n_598382f9e4b0cb15b1bd6e31", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Don't even try to fight the tears."}, "article": {"tag": "Arts and Entertainment,Social Media,latino", "section": "Latino Voices", "published_time": "2017-08-03 17:29:59 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-08-03 17:29:59 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "title": "You'll Cry After Watching LeJuan James Surprise His Parents With A New Home", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598387761500007d208b4faa.png?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "Don't even try to fight the tears.", "creator": "CaritoJuliette"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_598382f9e4b0cb15b1bd6e31", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501795799.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
