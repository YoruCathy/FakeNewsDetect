Love makes you do f\u2014ed up things. Do you think anyone\u2019s proud of that? No. You don\u2019t f\u2014 with someone\u2019s heart and emotions.\u201d\n\nAfter Rob\u2019s social media rampage, Chyna and her legal team accused him of violating California\u2019s revenge porn laws, claiming in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that he allegedly hit her and threatened to kill himself multiple times. A judge later granted her a set of restraining orders against her ex.\n\nHis actions launched a two-month-long custody war over their 14-month-old daughter Dream Ren\u00e9e. The two agreed to joint custody Sept. 15, PEOPLE confirmed \u2014 though at the time, Chyna\u2019s lawyer Lisa Bloom said the decision \u201cdoes not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Rob and Chyna have officially broken up, but they obviously still have to communicate for the custody of Dream,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says in the sneak peek. \u201cThey\u2019re still having a hard time getting along. The legal battle that has been going on between the two of them has been super frustrating. I feel like this is escalating to a place that none of us could have ever imagined.\u201d\n\nIn September, Rob and his sister Kylie Jenner, 20, sued Chyna for battery, assault and vandalism, alleging she attempted to choke Kardashian with an iPhone cord during a fight in December 2016. (Jenner owns the home where the alleged altercation took place.)\n\nIn the complaint, the siblings alleged Chyna made a \u201cdeliberate attempt to extort the Kardashian family for her own monetary gains\u201d and claimed her decision to have a baby with Rob was \u201cnothing short of an outright fraud to shake down the Kardashian family.\u201d\n\nIn October, Chyna filed her own lawsuit against her ex for allegedly damaging her brand and verbally and physically abusing her. In the filing obtained by PEOPLE, Chyna claims she has suffered \u201csignificant damages\u201d from his social media posts. She alleged the nude photo scandal \u2014 along with influence from the Kardashian family \u2014 are what got Rob & Chyna, her and Rob\u2019s E! reality show, axed before a season 2.\n\nShe also accused Rob of physical abuse, alleging that her ex once grabbed her phone out of her hand and \u201cviolently knocked her to the ground where she landed on her hands and knees\u201d after she tried to call Tyga, with whom she shares 5-year-old son King Cairo and who previously dated Jenner for almost three years.\n\nRELATED: Lawsuits, Assault Accusations and Social Media Wars \u2014 Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian\u2019s Rocky History\n\nRob, who denies the assault claims, and his family have requested that the case be dismissed. According to court documents filed Dec. 27 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles and obtained by The Blast, Rob \u201cgenerally and specifically denies each of the allegations\u201d and claimed Chyna \u201cdid not suffer any injury or harm as a result of any conduct by [Kardashian].\u201d\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE in response, Chyna\u2019s attorney said, \u201cWe are confident that we will prevail on this motion and at trial.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs this Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=842&h=441&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=842&h=441&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-rob-blac-chyna-drama/", "title": "Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian: Rob Should Have 'Controlled Himself' During Blac Chyna Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Blac Chyna,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,News,Rob Kardashian,TV", "news_keywords": "Blac Chyna,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,News,Rob Kardashian,TV", "description": "\"With Rob having sisters, he should just know better,\" says Kim Kardashian West in a Keeping Up with the Kardashians sneak peek", "og": {"title": "Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian: Rob Should Have 'Controlled Himself' During Blac Chyna Drama", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-rob-blac-chyna-drama/", "description": "Months after Rob Kardashian\u2018s drama with Blac Chyna reached its explosive peak, the aftermath is being documented on&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
