She paired the killer ensemble with black gladiator heels, soft makeup and her hair in a low ponytail. The Green Bay Packers quarterback looked suave in a navy tuxedo with black lapels and a white button-up shirt with a black bow-tie.\n\nThe two looked so in love as they smiled at each other on the red carpet, before Patrick took the stage to host the ceremony.\n\nAlberto E.

The former IndyCar and NASCAR driver kicked off her hosting gig by poking fun at various athletes, including LeBron James, the U.S. men's soccer team, Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors, Odell Beckham Jr. of the New York Giants and Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon.\n\nWhile Patrick was emceeing the show, the camera would show Rodgers admiring his lovely girlfriend.\n\nPatrick confirmed she was dating Rodgers in January after splitting from fellow NASCAR racer Ricky Stenhouse Jr. last November. The twosome first met at the 2012 ESPYs.\n\nIn May, she opened up about her relationship with the NFL star while on The Rachael Ray Show.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s funny, he\u2019s very kind, he\u2019s thoughtful, he\u2019s super smart,\" Patrick said of Rodgers. \"And he\u2019s really good at football. And he\u2019s tall and he\u2019s big and I like that.\u201d\n\nFor more on the couple, watch below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nDanica Patrick Gushes Over 'Thoughtful, Super Smart' Boyfriend Aaron Rodgers\n\nDanica Patrick Celebrates 36th Birthday With Boyfriend Aaron Rodgers: Pics!\n\nAaron Rodgers Kisses Danica Patrick at the Daytona 500: Pics\n\nRelated Articles:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Zn4GGWx1r6S1yPdqI5EiIw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAwO2g9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/c2e7cdd19d21e459e3a8037a868db877", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7w4QXLv56rGku_oH3e5GEQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-03-12/5d3d7a20-25f7-11e8-a583-35df99676a72_et.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lfGpUo3O.qPZNnqEhq6s9A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAwO2g9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/e032ddf37df644cdd4f11146a89b3478", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lTBDxVbSF4zrD27JveltOA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAwO2g9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/73d356cd3f960067b71a22e8d7b57935", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ci.V.Wyepm96XJM9ZtdN2w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/73d356cd3f960067b71a22e8d7b57935", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wGOdlISX.nM5jxdqwmNxPA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQwO2g9ODQ4/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/e032ddf37df644cdd4f11146a89b3478", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aLNGLqgZm_PU0hPUOvYPpQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQwO2g9ODY3/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/c2e7cdd19d21e459e3a8037a868db877"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ci.V.Wyepm96XJM9ZtdN2w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/73d356cd3f960067b71a22e8d7b57935", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/danica-patrick-makes-red-carpet-023135967.html", "title": "Danica Patrick Makes Red Carpet Debut With Aaron Rodgers Before Hosting 2018 ESPYs", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooFinance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 36-year-old racing driver was the first female host for the sports award show.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ci.V.Wyepm96XJM9ZtdN2w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/73d356cd3f960067b71a22e8d7b57935", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ci.V.Wyepm96XJM9ZtdN2w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/73d356cd3f960067b71a22e8d7b57935"}, "title": "Danica Patrick Makes Red Carpet Debut With Aaron Rodgers Before Hosting 2018 ESPYs"}, "news_keywords": "Danica Patrick, Aaron Rodgers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=2ed78911-d03c-3ac0-ad58-f753769238a3&src=web", "description": "The 36-year-old racing driver was the first female host for the sports award show.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ci.V.Wyepm96XJM9ZtdN2w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/73d356cd3f960067b71a22e8d7b57935", "description": "The 36-year-old racing driver was the first female host for the sports award show.", "title": "Danica Patrick Makes Red Carpet Debut With Aaron Rodgers Before Hosting 2018 ESPYs", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/danica-patrick-makes-red-carpet-023135967.html"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=2ed78911-d03c-3ac0-ad58-f753769238a3&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=2ed78911-d03c-3ac0-ad58-f753769238a3&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531967495.0, "source": "https://finance.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
