They\u2019re slickly \u201cempowered\u201d women, yet it\u2019s hard to distinguish that power from the thriller-video decadence of 21st-century action filmmaking.\n\nIn the elegantly tense and absorbing \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d on the other hand, Jennifer Lawrence portrays a Russian spy who\u2019s a cunningly desperate human being \u2014 or, at least, enough of one that each scene rotates around the choices she makes, the way she appraises and seizes the destiny of the moment. Lawrence, in this movie, shows you what true screen stardom is all about. She plays a spy as someone who acts out a role, but does so (paradoxically) by acting as little as possible; she cues each scene to a different mood, leaving the audience in a constant state of discovery. We\u2019re on her side, but more than that we\u2019re in her head. Even when (of course) we\u2019re being played.\n\nDirected by Francis Lawrence, who made the last three \u201cHunger Games\u201d films, working from a script by Justin Haythe (based on the 2013 novel by Jason Matthews, a former C.I.A. operative) that taps the audience\u2019s intelligence rather than insulting it, \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d presents Lawrence\u2019s character, Dominika Egorova, as a victim who is cast into a state of peril she has to dig her way out of, one ominous chess move at a time. The movie is a thriller, but it\u2019s also a kind of sexualized nightmare, and that\u2019s the boldness of it. Dominika starts off as a prima ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet, dancing before the glitterati of Moscow in a costume of resplendent red and gold. But her career is cut short by a horrific on-stage collision (not an accident, as we soon discover). It\u2019s here that she confronts what it means to be a pawn in the ruthless new Russian state (the same, it seems, as the old state). We also learn that when her fury flies, there will be blood.\n\nTo Western eyes, Dominika lives in a very modest flat, which she shares with her mother (Joely Richardson), whom she\u2019s devoted to taking care of. But as soon as her dancing days end, she learns that she\u2019s going to be stripped of her health insurance and the apartment. It\u2019s a dread-ridden slipping-out-of-the-middle-class scenario, and it spurs her to take up the offer of her uncle, Ivan (Matthias Schoenaerts, gleaming like Vladimir Putin\u2019s bureaucrat-sociopath son), who happens to be the deputy director of Russia\u2019s external intelligence agency, the SVR. He will keep her afloat, as long as she agrees to carry out a mission.\n\nFor a relatively traditional spy thriller, \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d is more up-to-the-minute than it looks \u2014 more so, even, than the filmmakers must have known when they were making it. Dominika\u2019s mission, in which she\u2019s assigned to bed a shady businessman in a gilded hotel room, plays like a Harvey Weinstein nightmare. She winds up witnessing a murder, which means that she herself will be eliminated unless she agrees to become a recruit at State School 4, a training ground for what are known as the Sparrows. As presented, they are undercover prostitutes from hell.\n\nThat sounds like a clich\u00e9, and maybe a sexist one. But \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d is actually a lively critique of the Mata Hari-as-dominatrix scenario it presents to us. It\u2019s about a heroine who has had her choices cut off by a thug patriarchy. The training school, run by the ultimate icy headmistress, played in sadistic high style by Charlotte Rampling, amounts to a series of encounter sessions in which the recruits are stripped down in every possible way. They\u2019re reduced to being utensils (\u201cYour body belongs to the state,\u201d says Rampling), which they learn to manipulate. Lawrence makes her nakedness dramatic; she plays Dominika as shamed and proud at the same time. The film presents her new, transactional relationship to sexuality as a pop projection of the torments that women have endured, and there\u2019s a resonance to that. When James Bond sleeps with someone, it\u2019s all part of the hedonistic sport of the spying life. In \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d it\u2019s quite the opposite. Dominika deeply resents her \u201cwhore school\u201d training. The men she faces add up to a conspiracy \u2014 sexual harassment as the dark underbelly of tradecraft.\n\nShe is sent to Budapest to have a \u201cchance\u201d encounter with Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), an American C.I.A. operative who has cultivated a mole high up in the Russian regime. We brace ourselves for another clich\u00e9: the tale of two spies who swoon for each other \u2014 and who, by the way, is using whom? But \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d is an espionage thriller that\u2019s more clever than it first appears. It contains a romantic spark (or, at least, a semi-smoldering ember), but Dominika and Nash quickly figure out everything there is to know about each other. And so the film keeps you guessing as to what\u2019s at stake.\n\nThe basic set-up is simple enough (will Dominika sniff out the mole?), but \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d has enough tangles and reversals to be a fully satisfying night out. It\u2019s more talk than action, in a gratifyingly unfolding way. At one point, Dominika joins forces with the Americans, leading to the film\u2019s most suspenseful sequence, which features Mary-Louise Parker as a neurotic lush who\u2019s the turncoat chief of staff for a U.S. senator. The double-crossing isn\u2019t movieish and abstract \u2014 it\u2019s scruffy, rooted in desperation and raw appetite. Edgerton makes Nash a down-to-earth operative, noble in his impulses but far from a superman. And Lawrence\u2019s Dominika is gripping, because she has to keep improvising. She\u2019s been trained to survive, and does, wriggling out of everything from extreme torture to gross come-ons from her boss. But is she calling the shots, or are the shots calling her?\n\nLawrence, with regal cheekbones and voluptuous bangs, has a great Slavic look, and eases into the soul of playing a Russian. She does it with an unobtrusive accent, though you wish the rest of the cast had followed suit. Jeremy Irons, as a Russian general, doesn\u2019t even try for the accent (though he\u2019s still very good). Schoenaerts does (sort of), and acts with a swinish glee, playing a character who\u2019s even creepier than we imagine (he\u2019s been fixated on Dominika since she was a child). There are no clips of Putin, and he isn\u2019t even referred to by name, yet he\u2019s a presence in this movie; he\u2019s the demigod of a corruption that the rest of the characters are acting out. For the first time in a long while, a thriller revives Cold War tensions in a way that doesn\u2019t feel corny, since the Russians, in \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d are standing in for the new world order: a global marketplace of people selling themselves. It\u2019s no wonder spying is trickier than ever. After a century of espionage, even the most undercover impulses are now out in the open, if not downright naked.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Freviews%2Fred-sparrow-review-jennifer-lawrence-1202700101%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202700101&comment_count=61", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/red-sparrow-review.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/red-sparrow-review.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Owen Gleiberman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/red-sparrow-review-jennifer-lawrence-1202700101/", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence gives a star performance as a spy driven by survival in an espionage thriller that's (gratifyingly) more talk than action.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202700101, "author": "Owen Gleiberman", "pmc-category": "Reviews", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-02-16T09:00:10"}, "pmc-tag": "Jennifer Lawrence,Jeremy Irons,Joel Edgerton,Red Sparrow", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film", "pmc-primary-category": "Reviews", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/red-sparrow-review-jennifer-lawrence-1202700101/", "description": "In pumped-up espionage potboilers like \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d or \u201cSalt,\u201d Charlize Theron and Angelina Jolie have gone through the motions of imitating male action stars at their mo\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/red-sparrow-review.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Red Sparrow Review"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-16T17:00:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-25T14:51:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@OwenGleiberman", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "Film Review: \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/red-sparrow-review.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "Red Sparrow Review"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence gives a star performance as a spy driven by survival in an espionage thriller that's (gratifyingly) more talk than action."}, "author": "Owen Gleiberman", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202700101, "title": "Film Review: 'Red Sparrow'", "published_at": "2018-02-16 09:00:10", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/red-sparrow-review.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 61, "tags": "Red Sparrow", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "In pumped-up espionage potboilers like \"Atomic Blonde\" or \"Salt,\" Charlize Theron and Angelina Jolie have gone through the motions of imitating male action stars at their most kick-ass grandiose.
