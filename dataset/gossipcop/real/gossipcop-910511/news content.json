(Photo: Rich Fury/Getty Images)\n\nI have friends who don\u2019t understand the phenomenon of \u201cGet Out.\u201d They just don\u2019t get it.\n\nWell, for every one of those people who doesn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d There are thousands who do. It was made for $4.5 million and has grossed more than $250 million worldwide.\n\nOscar nominations were announced Tuesday and I was both surprised and fist-pumpingly happy over its handful of nominations: Best movie, best original screenplay for Jordan Peele, best directing for Peele and best performance in a leading role for Daniel Kaluuya. The Academy Awards are March 4.\n\nFirst of all, I love horror flicks and historically only a handful of scary movies have ever been nominated by the Academy for best picture. So this is huge for the thriller/horror genre. And secondly, there is an underlying social message that Peele so masterfully weaves into the storyline that touches on the plight of African-Americans and resonates in the heightened discussions about equality today.\n\nIn various interviews and speeches, Peele has likened the \u201csunken place\u201d to the system that silences the voice of women, minorities and other people.\n\nPeele and Kaluuya were in Palm Springs earlier this month for the Variety Brunch awards held annually during the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Peele was there to present Kaluuya with the Creative Impact in Acting Award.

Kaluuya talked about how grateful he was that Peele believed in him and ultimately took a chance on him.\n\nThe director, who started out in comedy on such sketch shows as \"MADtv\" and \"Key and Peele,\" said he noticed the young actor in an episode of \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d He said Kaluuya delivered one of the most \u201cpassionate, primal, beautiful\u201d monologues he\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful episode of television and Daniel in it plays a character who really showed me the complete spectrum of emotion that I knew I would need for my movie,\u201d Peele said.\n\nJordan Peele earned a Directors Guild nomination on his first try with 'Get Out.'

I wondered if the two cultures would translate. If being a black British person, how it related to being an African-American \u2014 what this movie was about.\u201d\n\nOnce the two Skyped for about half an hour, Kaluuya put all of Peele's concerns to rest. He said Kaluuya got the script and really showed that he grasped not only the African-American experience of being black in white spaces and what it means to navigate in a world like that, but that kind of experience overall regardless of nationality.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018black is black. Right? You know what I mean? Black is black.\u2019 And that really stuck. I knew what he meant then. And so he won me over there,\u201d said Peele.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams in 'Get Out.' (Photo: Justin Lubin)\n\nAnd then when it came time for Kaluuya to actually audition, Peele said their jaws dropped. They did the scene where Kaluuya\u2019s character (spoiler alert!) is getting hypnotized by Catherine Keener\u2019s character and he delivered the scene as close as possible to what is in the actual movie.\n\nAnd then when it came time to actually film that scene, they did five takes and in each one a tear rolled out of his eye basically at the same minute, at the same second, in each take, said Peele.\n\n\u201cHaving him on the actual set of the film was a dream for a first-time director like myself. His process is beautiful. All he asks is that you give him the emotion that he needs to feel. You\u2019re discovering more about this role yourself while you\u2019re talking to him,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more you can dream of as a director.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: What the stars had to say on and off the red carpet at the Palm Springs International Film Festival gala\n\n'Get Out' is one of the best picture nominees at this year's Academy Awards. (Photo: Universal Pictures)\n\nKaluuya, who said he had no idea how huge the film would become, said he owes the film\u2019s success to Peele and his success on screen to Peele\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many things that have to happen for me to just do my job. To do acting. There\u2019s so many pieces. So many stars have to align. But a major piece (that) has to be there for me to do my job is belief and someone believed in me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we live in a world where because of who I am and the hue I have people don\u2019t. And that\u2019s tough. So when Jordan did it meant the world to me and I just didn\u2019t want to let him down.\u201d\n\nKaluuya saw the movie again just a couple days prior to his Palm Springs visit and said he came away thinking what a special filmmaker Peele is and how impressive the movie was.\n\n\u201cAnd I felt so privileged that you allowed me to do it with you. And to help me tell your truth,\u201d said Kaluuya to Peele.\n\nHave something for the column?
