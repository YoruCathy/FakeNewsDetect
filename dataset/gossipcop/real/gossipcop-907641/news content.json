He had so much fun doing that. It was actually the exact opposite. There was no doom and gloom. ... That was a shock to me that people even thought that, really.\u201d\n\nThe documentary hits theaters tonight (Wednesday) for one night only in partnership with Fathom Events, and then will air on Spike TV on May 17.\n\nLedger died on Jan. 22, 2008, at age 28 in New York City from an accidental overdose of prescription medication and sleeping aids. The role of the Joker would win him a posthumous Oscar for his work in The Dark Knight in 2009.\n\n\u201cLike many of us, we read all sorts of insinuations online that Heath Ledger was taken down this dark spiral path to the depths of depression from his role as the Joker \u2014 this is the reason why we lost this bright star so early in his life,\u201d says I Am Heath Ledger producer and co-director Derik Murray. \u201cWhat was incredible, what was really quite amazing is that the truth behind that is so polar opposite.\u201d\n\nI Am Heath Ledger begins during Ledger\u2019s youth, utilizing hours of the actor\u2019s own home videos. The film charts his quick rise in Hollywood. Less than a year after moving to Los Angeles, he booked the lead role in the 1999 hit teen rom-com 10 Things I Hate About You opposite Julia Stiles.\n\nThen Ledger pivoted, turning down opportunities like Spider-Man and making films that would lead him to work like Lords of Dogtown and his Oscar-nominated role in Brokeback Mountain.\n\n\u201cAs you see in the documentary, he could have very easily gone down that heartthrob career (path) and done a lot of those roles, and he chose not to right from the very beginning,\" says Kate. \"He wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. He was always in command of what he did. He wouldn\u2019t just do something for the money.\u201d\n\nKate Ledger says filmmakers have been knocking at her family\u2019s door since her brother\u2019s death, but it was the involvement of executive producer Matt Amato, her brother\u2019s close friend, that gave them trust the documentary would be done right.\n\nPlus, they had Michelle Williams\u2019 blessing. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have done anything otherwise,\u201d says Kate, revealing little about Ledger\u2019s ex-girlfriend or their child together, Matilda (now 11), though she confirms the family sees both often. \u201cI love them so much and I\u2019m so protective of them that I don\u2019t like to discuss them. Because it\u2019s very private, their life, and I just like to keep it like that,\u201d she says.\n\nThough Ledger\u2019s parents, directors and friends (including Naomi Watts and Ben Harper) appear in the documentary, Williams does not. \u201cShe just felt she was not ready to be on camera and be talking about Heath, which we respected,\u201d says Murray.\n\nToday, Kate Ledger says dealing with her brother\u2019s death as the world watched nine years ago was indescribable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like two separate things. The shock itself was one thing and dealing with it in the public eyes was completely different \u2014 I actually can\u2019t put it into words and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to,\u201d says Ledger, who has since set up a scholarship in her brother\u2019s name for emerging Australian talent. \u201cNot too many people have to experience that. It\u2019s hard enough to experience losing a loved one (without) doing it in front of everyone else. It\u2019s horrendous.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e53ebf636892716b2d5b22a986acd2d3a3dbeef6/c=0-25-358-227/local/-/media/2017/05/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/636294130388821015-I-AM-HEATH-photo.png?width=358&height=202&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8da11378502b364fc0f9d780142c7a548c8ddd0c/c=0-0-358-477/local/-/media/2017/05/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/636294130388821015-I-AM-HEATH-photo.png?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e53ebf636892716b2d5b22a986acd2d3a3dbeef6/c=0-25-358-227/local/-/media/2017/05/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/636294130388821015-I-AM-HEATH-photo.png?width=358&height=202&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/03/joker-did-not-kill-heath-ledger-says-sister/101246100/", "title": "'The Dark Knight's' Joker did not kill Heath Ledger, says sister", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "'The Dark Knight's' Joker did not kill Heath Ledger, says sister", "description": "New documentary dispels myth that playing the Joker sent Ledger spiraling into depression.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/03/joker-did-not-kill-heath-ledger-says-sister/101246100/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e53ebf636892716b2d5b22a986acd2d3a3dbeef6/c=0-25-358-227/local/-/media/2017/05/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/636294130388821015-I-AM-HEATH-photo.png?width=358&height=202&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 358, "height": 202}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Andrea Mandell", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "New documentary dispels myth that playing the Joker sent Ledger spiraling into depression.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e53ebf636892716b2d5b22a986acd2d3a3dbeef6/c=0-25-358-227/local/-/media/2017/05/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/636294130388821015-I-AM-HEATH-photo.png?width=358&height=179&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "'The Dark Knight's' Joker did not kill Heath Ledger, says sister", "description": "New documentary dispels myth that playing the Joker sent Ledger spiraling into depression."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493740800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
