Their relationship was heavily scrutinized by the RHONY cast from the beginning, but the couple seemed to face their critics with a united front. But, Tom and Luann weren't married for very long before it was reported that the pair will filing for divorce after just seven months of marriage.\n\nThis is the second divorce for The Countess (can we call her that again, now?), having previously been married to Alexandre de Lesseps for 16 years. RHONY fans are well aware that Luann and Tom were not starting off their brief marriage on the most stable of feet. Last season, fellow housewife Bethenny Frankel alleged that she had photos of Tom and another woman kissing at a NYC bar before the couple's engagement party. (Tom has never flat-out denied these claims \u2014 he said on the show that he didn\u2019t remember, and then he said to Luann on the phone, \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d He and Luann did an interview with People soon afterward in which Tom said, \u201cIf I could take it back, I would. I deeply regret the mistakes I've made, and most of all hate the way it hurt Luann.\")\n\nSome fans were shocked to see that they went ahead with the wedding despite these allegations, but Luann was confident that they could move past the drama. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like things were able to be completely resolved in the end and Luann made an announcement about their split on her Twitter page, asking fans to please respect their privacy.\n\nLuann's costars have begun to weigh in on the situation, with Ramona taking to Twitter to give her response to the news.\n\nSince this season of RHONY has almost wrapped completely, it is unclear whether the divorce will be part of next season's storyline. Hopefully, everything moves smoothly and Luann and Tom can part ways without too much extra drama.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/14/efcd4f59-9964-4c6d-a6ad-4634b0b09f8a-getty-1156675580.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/8/3/a1630cd8-c5bb-4df1-ad50-875ed8a675a0-getty-634619768.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/15/37f4f60e-5d87-4523-9a7d-39f782b3c0e4-getty-1209799355.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/15/0da7790c-e1c6-4938-8b28-31640686b33f-getty-1209799362.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/2/6534f3ff-ed4a-48a5-867b-2a0737fbc057-getty-1154921708.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/8/3/a1630cd8-c5bb-4df1-ad50-875ed8a675a0-getty-634619768.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/8/3/a1630cd8-c5bb-4df1-ad50-875ed8a675a0-getty-634619768.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/how-long-were-luann-tom-dagostino-married-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-star-only-just-walked-the-aisle-74412", "title": "How Long Were Luann & Tom D'Agostino Married?
