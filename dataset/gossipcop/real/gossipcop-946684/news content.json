I never would have wittingly called any black person . . . a monkey. I just wouldn\u2019t do that. I didn\u2019t do that. And people think that I did that, and it just kills me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBarr reiterated her explanation that she was medicated with the sleep drug Ambien when she posted the tweet comparing Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, to an ape. The tweet in late May read: \u201cmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBarr told Boteach that she did not know Jarrett was black, an assertion she has also made publicly.\n\n\u201cWhen ABC called me and said, \u2018What is the reason for your egregious racism?\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh my God, it is a form of racism,\u2019 \u201d Barr said. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t know she was black, and I\u2019ll cop to it, but I thought she was white.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you still regret and don\u2019t excuse what you wrote,\u201d asked Boteach, who said he has been friends with Barr for two decades.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOf course, no, I don\u2019t excuse it. I horribly regret it. Are you kidding? I lost everything, and I regretted it before I lost everything,\u201d Barr responded. \u201cAnd I said to God: \u2018I am willing to accept whatever consequences this brings because I know I\u2019ve done wrong. I\u2019m willing to accept what the consequences are.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBarr added that many refuse to accept her apology. \u201cI\u2019ve made myself a hate magnet,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Barr\u2019s tweet about Jarrett, ABC shut down the \u201cRoseanne\u201d revival, which Barr had starred in. When Barr blamed the tweet on Ambien, the company that produces the drug responded that \u201cracism is not a known side effect\u201d of any of its medications.\n\nAD\n\nLast week, three weeks after ABC abruptly canceled the show, the network said it had ordered a spinoff centered on the same family, but without Barr. The working title is \u201cThe Conners.\u201d\n\nBoteach, whom The Washington Post once called \u201cAmerica\u2019s most famous rabbi,\u201d has been a spiritual guide for the likes of Michael Jackson and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J). In releasing the podcast interview Sunday, he praised Barr for her \u201cincredibly public and passionate commitment to Judaism.\u201d\n\nAfter Barr\u2019s Twitter rant, Boteach said he \u201creached out to her and told her that she has a responsibility, in the name of repentance and her commitment to Judaism, to make this right.\u201d In the interview, he asked her to affirm that she believes in the Torah values that \u201cevery human being is created equally in the image of God.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBreaking down in tears, Barr spoke of her intense remorse: \u201cAfter your heart is unfrozen and after it stops being broken from the pain you caused others, you stop being a robot and you\u2019ve got to come back to God.\u201d\n\nBarr said what she did makes her \u201csick.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t defend it. I don\u2019t want to defend it,\u201d she said. The actress said she had been trying to call Jarrett to apologize to her personally.\n\n\u201cI caused a lot of pain. I know that, and that\u2019s the worst feeling in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI caused pain for my family, I caused pain for my mother, I caused pain to the 200 out-of-work actors that I loved, and the crew and writers. I feel so bad that they gave me another chance and I blew it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut I did it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd what can I do now except for say . . . I\u2019m not a racist, I\u2019m an idiot. And I might have done something that comes across as bigoted and ignorant, and I know that that\u2019s how it came across. And you know, I just ask for forgiveness because I do love all people, I really do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s the interview:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WQTVRV5VE2HVH47MHDEETQHBU.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4Rv1QNGA7JWSexqXbopF8QDORbs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WE2Z55WIY3JLLRFCAD3CH3KUA.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/c71d0f75-e726-4b3e-a5fe-039e913143fc.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4Rv1QNGA7JWSexqXbopF8QDORbs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WE2Z55WIY3JLLRFCAD3CH3KUA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/25/roseanne-barr-breaks-down-sobbing-in-first-interview-after-racist-tweet-ive-lost-everything/", "title": "Roseanne Barr breaks down sobbing in newly released interview after racist tweet: \u2018I\u2019ve lost everything\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Roseanne Barr spoke of her remorse in an interview with her longtime friend and spiritual adviser Rabbi Shmuley\u00a0Boteach.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/25/roseanne-barr-breaks-down-sobbing-in-first-interview-after-racist-tweet-ive-lost-everything/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4Rv1QNGA7JWSexqXbopF8QDORbs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4WE2Z55WIY3JLLRFCAD3CH3KUA.jpg", "title": "Roseanne Barr breaks down sobbing in newly released interview after racist tweet: \u2018I\u2019ve lost everything\u2019", "description": "Roseanne Barr spoke of her remorse in an interview with her longtime friend and spiritual adviser Rabbi Shmuley\u00a0Boteach."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Roseanne Barr breaks down sobbing in newly released interview after racist tweet: \u2018I\u2019ve lost everything\u2019", "description": "Roseanne Barr spoke of her remorse in an interview with her longtime friend and spiritual adviser Rabbi Shmuley\u00a0Boteach."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-29T21:36:17.573Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529856000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
