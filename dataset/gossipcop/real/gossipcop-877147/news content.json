Kim revealed that she uses shaving-cream to remove makeup stains in a quick and easy way. She shared the advice on her app:\n\n\u201cJust apply to the stain and then lightly wet or wash.

The stain should lift out easily.\u201d\n\nSee more: Kim Kardashian on Trump\n\nKim Kardashian is a leader in the beauty community so it\u2019s not surprising that she has developed some tricks along the way.
