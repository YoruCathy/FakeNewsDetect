See his cutest photos with Kingston, Zuma and Apollo here!\n\nGwen Stefani is the proud mom of three sons, Kingston Rossdale, 11, Zuma Rossdale, 9, and Apollo Rossdale, 4, who she shares with her ex, Gavin Rossdale. The exes agreed to a 50/50 joint custody agreement when they finalized their divorce in 2016, but when we see the children in public, it\u2019s often with Gwen and her boyfriend, Blake Shelton. Despite never having any babies of his own, Blake has proven to be the perfect father for his girlfriend\u2019s kids, and we\u2019ve rounded up some of the most adorable pics of him bonding with Kingston, Zuma and Apollo.\n\nThe boys have taken quite a liking to Blake, and have taken several trips to his home in Oklahoma, where he\u2019s taught them all his country ways. From fishing, to trekking through the mud and so much more, the kids always seem so happy when they\u2019re spending time with Blake. Of course, Gwen has also brought them to many of his concerts, and shared social media videos of them rocking out backstage. Too cute! Gwen and Blake aren\u2019t married or even engaged, but Blake definitely acts like a stepfather to the boys and treats them like his own when they\u2019re together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fun,\u201d Blake admitted last month, while discussing his relationship with the boys. \u201cAt this point in my life, I kind of had put [children] as like, \u2018Well that wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u2019 And then all of a sudden, it happens one way or another, and it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow, I missed out on a lot.'\u201d\n\nClick through the gallery above to check out the sweetest photos of Blake with Kingston, Zuma and Apollo!", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake-gwens-kids-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake-gwens-kids-ftr.jpg?w=620", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F07%2Fblake-shelton-relationship-gwen-stefani-kids-cutest-photos-eg18%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3066638"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake-gwens-kids-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/07/blake-shelton-relationship-gwen-stefani-kids-cutest-photos-eg18/", "title": "19 Cutest Photos Of Blake Shelton With Gwen Stefani\u2019s Kids That Prove He\u2019d Be The Best Stepdad", "meta_data": {"description": "Blake Shelton has the sweetest relationship with Gwen Stefani's kids!
