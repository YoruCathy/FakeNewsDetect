Keep on dreaming big for yourself...and maybe one day I'll proudly look up at a portrait of you! pic.twitter.com/faUVTsYWun \u2014 Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) March 6, 2018\n\nOf course, the Internet went insane.\n\nChelsea Clinton, who tweeted the photo on Monday night, responded almost instantly.\n\nMagic. Pure magic. \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) March 6, 2018\n\nAnd here\u2019s the photo that started it all:\n\nParker\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t immediately available to describe the moment, referring an inquiry to a public relations firm \u2014 thus confirming Parker\u2019s big-time status.\n\nAD\n\nLater in the day, after Parker had taken a nap, Curry explained how the meeting happened. She said that Obama\u2019s staff reached out to her a couple days ago and invited the family for a visit at her office. They spent about 45 minutes together.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe was so unbelievably generous with her time,\u201d Curry said. \u201cShe\u2019s everything I thought she would be and more \u2014 classy, elegant, so down to earth.\u201d\n\nDuring the fun and dancing, Parker offered the same assessment of Obama that she did after seeing the portrait.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a queen,\u201d she said.\n\nThe last few days have been a whirlwind for Parker and her family.\n\nOn Thursday, Curry took Parker and her 1-year-old sister, Ava, to the National Portrait Gallery to see the new paintings of the Obamas.\n\nAD\n\nParker is a big fan of Michelle Obama. Earlier in her short life, after watching Obama dance on the \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d Parker declared she, too, would like to dance with the former first lady.\n\nAt the gallery, Parker was so entranced by the portrait, staring up at with her mouth wide open, that she wouldn\u2019t turn around to her mom for a photograph. This was precisely the moment Parker\u2019s life would change forever.\n\nAD\n\nBen Hines, a 37-year-old from North Carolina, was standing nearby to the side and watched the moment unfold. He took out his cellphone and snapped a photo of Parker in total amazement. He tried to find Parker and her mom later, but couldn\u2019t, so he posted the photo on Facebook, hoping the Internet would connect them.\n\nAD\n\nOh, it did.\n\nThe photo quickly went viral. And, eventually, someone tagged Curry on Hines\u2019s Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThis is what America is all about,\u201d tweeted an Atlanta man. \u201cThis young girl can now dream about being someone like Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\nThe striking portrait of Obama \u2014 in a long, flowing dress against a light blue background \u2014 was painted by Baltimore artist Amy Sherald, who was chosen by the former first lady.\n\nAt her portrait\u2019s unveiling last month, Obama said she was thinking of young girls \u2014 and girls of color, \u201cwho in the years ahead will come to this place and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of a great American institution. . . . And I know the kind of impact that will have on their lives because I was one of those girls.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GKwp3kvdunrRPWOtzhP2kwcVC3I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ONTN27JIAQ74JHKGXRCROV3GF4.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/f9c12add-27fb-46ff-8deb-93ff5bc46f45.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GKwp3kvdunrRPWOtzhP2kwcVC3I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ONTN27JIAQ74JHKGXRCROV3GF4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael S.
