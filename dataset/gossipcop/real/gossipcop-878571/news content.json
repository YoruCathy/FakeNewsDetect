Richards\u2019 attorney was told by Commissioner Jane Godfrey that if Richards\u2019 hours weren\u2019t completed at Midnight Mission by September 7th, 2017 she could face jail time.\n\nGodfrey also said that Richards could avoid a sentence based on good cause, which means she wouldn\u2019t have all 450 hours completed but she\u2019d be almost done or prove that she\u2019s making an effort to complete her community service hours.\n\nRichards\u2019 attorney appeared in court on Friday for her client\u2019s progress report stemming from Richards\u2019 2015 Beverly Hills Hotel arrest. Richards\u2019 attorney confirmed that her client has completed 180 hours of the court ordered total of 450 hours of community service. Proof of service, a written letter from the place in which Richards has been doing community service stating the progress so far, was also given to the court justice, E! News is reporting.\n\nA new date for another progress report was set for December 19th, 2017. At this hearing Richards must have proof that the remaining 270 hours of community service have been completed. She\u2019ll need to bring another letter as proof of service that the hours are complete.\n\nKim seems to be in a great place these days and we couldn\u2019t be happier for her. She recently said, \u201cMy recovery has been amazing and I love how I feel. This has been a huge part of it and has helped me a lot. The Sanctuary keeps me grounded and keeps me at peace and it\u2019s healthy for me. It\u2019s been amazing for me and me coming here has really been a major part of keeping me sober.\u201d\n\nWay to go, Kim!\n\nPhoto Credit: Bravo\n\nYou Might Also Like:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/http://allthingsrh.com/wp-content/authors/admin-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i1.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kelly-3.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lydia.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Bethenny.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Lisa-1.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/http://allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KimRichards.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i2.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Phaedra-6.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/http://allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/atrhheader1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TamRicky.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i1.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Meghan-1.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/KyleLisa.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LeeAnne-3.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i2.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tam.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Yolanda.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i1.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KimRichards.jpg?resize=800%2C450", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/LisaVP.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Joe.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i0.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/brooks-ayers-cancer-meghan-edmonds-legal-letter-cease-desist-01.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/https://i1.wp.com/allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ShannonDavid.jpg?resize=200%2C200"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170915073425im_/http://allthingsrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KimRichards.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["My Name Is Nicki.
