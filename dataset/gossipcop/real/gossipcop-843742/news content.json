{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/gallery/11-times-selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-couldnt-keep-their-hands-to-themselves", "text": "In 2015, Selena Gomez released her deeply underrated bop \"Hands to Myself.\" And ever since, people frequently associate Gomez with it\u2014especially when it comes to her boyfriend, The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye). It's pretty obvious why: Gomez and The Weeknd really enjoy showing their love for each other in public (and on social media), which makes \"Hands to Myself\" the perfect theme song for their relationship. Is it cheesy? Sure! Are we going to keep saying it? Absolutely! It's what the pop-music gods want! From Disneyland to the Met Gala, the Weeknd and Gomez's PDA is worldwide\u2014and we're 100 percent here for it.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a078bc5fdabb483b05c627/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/dinner1.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59ada46b157355325f769dc2/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/selena-weeknd-sidewalk-2.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d212565a2d1b2a5041/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/selena-the-weeknd.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d15fdabb483b05c623/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/coachella.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a0790d5fdabb483b05c629/16:9/w_400%2Cc_limit/andagain.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d40d239868ca4b38b7/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/snapchat%2520story.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a0790d5fdabb483b05c629/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/andagain.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d46746a8222b26ff32/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/selfie.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d512565a2d1b2a5043/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/selena-weeknd-2.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d627c2f9352e0158ff/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/THE%2520MET%2520GALA.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a0790d5fdabb483b05c629/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/andagain.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a077d45fdabb483b05c625/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/disney-land.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a0790812565a2d1b2a5045/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/met%2520aggain.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a0790d5fdabb483b05c629/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/andagain.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/gallery/11-times-selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-couldnt-keep-their-hands-to-themselves", "title": "11 Times Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Couldn't Keep Their Hands to Themselves", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are one of Hollywood's cutest couples, and they love showing it.
