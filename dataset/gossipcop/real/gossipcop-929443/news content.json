Constance has a few killer moments in a crowded heist movie, and leaves the audience wanting more.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey won\u2019t be waiting long. At a recent Ocean\u2019s 8 screening in Manhattan, the performer who plays Constance, Awkwafina, described herself as \u201cthe least important person in this room.\u201d (In her defense, said room also contained Mindy Kaling, Cate Blanchett, Sandra Bullock, and Anne Hathaway.) Awkwafina (real name Nora Lum) thrives on self-deprecating humor, but even she seems aware that her perceived importance is surging by the day. Beyond the powerhouse, Bechdel Test-obliterating Ocean\u2019s 11 reboot, the well-hyphened Awkwafina is blowing up in every direction, with new movies, music, and a TV show on the way. Pretty soon, there will be far fewer rooms she enters in which she isn\u2019t the attentional bullseye dead center. The room where I meet Lum is tucked inside the lavish Whitby Hotel in midtown. It\u2019s nearly big enough to run laps in. She seems laid back and comfortable occupying this space and holding court with interviewers, though, even if she quickly cops to being stunned by the star treatment. \u201cYesterday, I had a designated security guard named Phil,\u201d she says, shaking her head in a mild daze. \u201cThis whole thing has been insane.\u201d The Queens native first began to sow her creative oats at LaGuardia High School, forever known as the Fame school, where she dabbled in a little bit of everything artistic. Going to the school also opened up the city for her beyond Queens, exposing New York\u2019s heavy-beating cultural heart. Lum came up with the sobriquet Aquafina at 16, just because she liked the way it sounded. She wouldn\u2019t actually adopt it (or change the spelling for legal purposes) until years later. She also started making beats on her MacBook around this time, influenced by hometown heroes like A Tribe Called Quest. Today, Lum seems half-proud, half-embarrassed that the thing that ultimately changed her life was a three-minute rap called \u201cMy Vag.\u201d Considering that her breakout movie role is in a gender-flipped reboot, it\u2019s fitting that her first song was a feminized reimagining of Mickey Avalon\u2019s raunch-rap anthem, \u201cMy Dick.\u201d She wrote \u201cMy Vag\u201d early in college, then kept it on ice for five years, as she tried to figure out what to do with her life.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cI was just kind of slumming it,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I could make \u2018Awkwafina\u2019 work.\u201d She spent time behind the counter of a bodega. She worked for a while at an air conditioning company. She did a bunch of under-the-table odd jobs, and had stints at a major Japanese restaurant and in a publishing house publicity department. She was stationed at her most comfortable office job yet when, in 2012, she finally decided to make a real run at Awkwafina. Lum worked with director Court Dunn to make the legit-looking video for \u201cMy Vag.\u201d Awkwafina\u2019s debut is a delightful absurdity that alternates between rooftop stunting and a G-rated gynecological excavation, where the star extracts a Big Gulp and way too much police tape from a woman in stirrups. Worried that her employers would recognize her, Lum donned a pair of disco glasses to obscure her face, creating part of what became her signature look. She comes across in the video as equal parts ultrahip NYC club kid and approachable goofball. When \u201cMy Vag\u201d came out, the creator sat watching viewer stats rise like a stock ticker: 100, 4000, 70,000. Perhaps they\u2019d climb high enough to lead to something, the demand for more music at the very least. (The tally now stands at 2.4 million views.) Before she could figure out her next move, though, her employer did recognize her from the viral video and she got fired. It was more of a boost than a blow, injecting Lum with a no-plan-B sense of urgency. She had a brand now, and a calling card. Awkwafina was a go. \u201cIt all happened very quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cMy phone just started ringing. That video hit way harder than I ever thought.\u201d Other videos followed, but Lum didn\u2019t wait long before seizing her first opportunity to branch out. The production company Astronauts Wanted, which worked with Vine celebrities like Cameron Dallas and Nash Grier, reached out and asked if she had any ideas. She did. She imagined an Awkwafina talk show, where she would vamp around New York City, interviewing homeless people and prostitutes. Astronauts Wanted assured her that was not possible. They compromised, though, and created Tawk, a show for Verizon go90 where Lum interviewed comedians and actors like Phoebe Robinson and Alia Shawkat in between sketches and rap interludes. The roving talk show filmed in bodegas on the Lower East Side or laundromats in Bushwick. It gave fans of her rapping a chance to hear her sandpaper-raspy speaking voice and see her ecstatic, IDGAF dance moves.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLum quickly became super busy, making her 2014 album, Yellow Rangers, while also working on her talk show and somehow finding the time to write a book, Awkwafina\u2019s NYC. She also got cast on MTV\u2019s comedy advice show, Girl Code. From an early age, Lum had always wanted to be on television; now she was. She hadn\u2019t really considered acting as a career possibility, though, at least not until Seth Rogen and some fellow producers saw the video for \u201cMy Vag,\u201d and thought Lum should be in Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. It was a level-jump that seemed to come out of nowhere. \u201cI just never expected that I would be needed for acting,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when I was on air for Tawk or for Girl Code, I was able to harness this kind of creative ability that I couldn\u2019t do in lyrics or a musical setting and acting bleeds into that. I\u2019m able to give something else to this collaborative project I couldn\u2019t really do musically and I love that shit.\u201d The opportunities continued pouring in after she got cast in Neighbors 2\u2013just not exactly the right ones. Lum was proud of her heritage (she\u2019s the product of a South Korean immigrant mother and a first-generation Chinese-American father) and she didn\u2019t want to compromise its integrity based on whatever Hollywood happened to be seeking at the moment. \u201cI started to get a lot of auditions that were really weird side roles for Asian characters, where either they brought out all those old tropes or they were just an added Benetton effect, a visual thing,\u201d she says. \u201cThose roles I didn\u2019t take to, they just weren\u2019t for me, so I chose other ones very quickly.\u201d Her next two projects proved pivotal. One was Salima Koroma\u2019s documentary, Bad Rap, which placed Awkwafina within the broader context of the Asian-American hip-hop community, and the other was the Kush-scented coming-of-age comedy, Dude, which is out now on Netflix. The latter project introduced Lum to its up-and-coming writer/director Olivia Milch, who at the time was also penning the screenplay for Ocean\u2019s 8, a film with an open role perfect for a plucky ingenue. The Ocean\u2019s 8 character Lum ended up playing has an identity that has nothing to do with her ethnicity. She\u2019s a blink-and-you\u2019ve-been-robbed pickpocket, and a woman after the star\u2019s own heart.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat I liked about Constance and what drew me in is that she\u2019s not just a New Yorker, she\u2019s from Queens and her fiber is very much a product of that environment,\u201d Lum says. \u201cHer hustle\u2013dreaming of a better life and how to hustle your way into it\u2013that is Awkwafina\u2019s story too, and it bled very well into my own life.\u201d In the film, we meet Constance while she is scamming Queens pedestrians at Three-card Monte. To prepare for the scene, Lum studied auctioneers and street hustlers religiously (though she once saw her own dad get duped at the game.) She was also paired with a sleight-of-hand coach for the film, who she inevitably befriended and cadged some David Blaine secrets from. (\u201cI can entertain kids for days now,\u201d she notes.) Later this summer, Lum will also appear in Crazy Rich Asians, a comedy her costar Jimmy O. Yang describes as \u201cthe Asian Black Panther.\u201d In a sprawling cast, Lum plays headliner Constance Wu\u2019s quirky best friend, Goh Peik Lin, who gets all the hot lines. As a big fan of the popular Kevin Kwan book the film is based on, Lum felt like she was in a Harry Potter movie, more or less. She worried about shattering the image of the character fans had in their heads. By the time she got on set, though, she was feeling confident about her acting. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s cool about both Crazy Rich Asians and Ocean\u2019s 8, is that both directors trusted in my ability to improv and that trust leads me to trust myself even more and whatever I\u2019m doing,\u201d says Lum. Her confidence will be put to the test soon as she puts the finishing touches on the show she\u2019s currently developing for Comedy Central. (A new rap EP is on the way as well. It is not clear when, if ever, Lum actually sleeps.) Awkwafina, which the star is writing and producing with Teresa Hsiao and showrunner Karey Dornetto, is a narrative series steeped in the ridiculousness of growing up in Queens and trying to make it big. After years of living through that process, Lum is ready to look back and wring some well-earned laughs from it. \u201cI wanted it to be a story about New York told by a POC New Yorker, which is something you don\u2019t see,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see some POC-led shows that take place in New York but not by someone who\u2019s actually from there. Especially Queens. It\u2019s such a different existence and such a different cast of people out there, and you never see them reflected on TV. I know that I\u2019m searching for that and I wanted the show to reflect it.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith all of these projects bubbling up, the hype around Lum is now in dangerous proximity to her head. At the moment, though, she\u2019s not personally buying into it\u2013private security guards named Phil, be damned. \u201cI will never believe that I\u2019m as cool as some people have made it out to be,\u201d she vows. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s a good thing, because then I\u2019d be an asshole.\u201d", "images": ["https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/insta-icon-circle-in.svg", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-805310h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/fb-icon-circle-fb.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjincfastcoprod/1/H.24.4--NS/0/5658306", "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/p-1-get-ready-for-awkwafina-the-and8220oceanand8217s-8and8221-rapperactor-you-need-to-know-1.jpg", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/linkedin-icon-circle-li.svg", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/tw-icon-circle-tw.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1389601884702365&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/p-1-get-ready-for-awkwafina-the-and8220oceanand8217s-8and8221-rapperactor-you-need-to-know-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/40581074/oceans-8-star-awkwafina-is-stealing-the-show-on-all-fronts", "title": "\u201cOcean\u2019s 8\u201d star Awkwafina is stealing the show on all fronts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The rapper-actor-TV-show creator is about to be everywhere.
