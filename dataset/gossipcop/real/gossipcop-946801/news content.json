Did you get engaged? Oh my gosh, congratulations! I wanna send a gift!' But I was really being nosey and he didn't text me back,\" Brown said, disappointed.\n\nUltimately, it was Porowski who's quiet, sage wisdom summed up their defense of Davidson and Grande's engagement the best: \"Sometimes, you just know.\"\n\nBack in March, France took Davidson on a shopping adventure through New York City to help him step up his style game, in a short video shared by Saturday Night Live. However, it seems their friendship has stayed strong.\n\n\"I just went shopping with him a couple days ago,\" France said, although he didn't reveal whether or not he'd be helping him shop for wedding clothes whenever that day comes.\n\nRecently, ET sat down with the Fab Five to talk about the upcoming second season of Queer Eye, and the stars dished on the most interesting fan mail they've ever gotten, and revealed which celebs they've love to have on as guest experts.\n\nCheck out the video below to hear more.\n\n'Queer Eye:' The Fab Five Dish on Fan Mail and Dream Guest Stars (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
