Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2016\n\nTommy Mottola\n\n\"It\u2019s easy to toss around the word \u2018iconic\u2019, but Prince truly epitomized the word to the very core of his being. Lots of big stars have made waves nationally and internationally, but Prince by far was the most groundbreaking more than anyone\u2026from his music, to his concerts \u2014 to even the way he entered a room, always surrounded with that magical air of superstardom, mystique, and genius. Bringing together film and music with Purple Rain was a glimpse into the future of not only the music industry, but the entire media and entertainment industry. When you saw Prince, you never knew what you were going to get, but you always knew it was going to be greatness and something spectacular. He is loved and will be deeply missed forever. The world is experiencing a tremendous loss today.\"\n\nNew Girl Executive Producers\n\nWe are all so deeply saddened to hear about the passing of this hero of ours - and so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet him and to have him on our show. It's something we will remember forever. Our thoughts go out to his family. We are among the millions of people who will truly miss the brilliant Artist.\n\nFrank Ocean\n\n\"I\u2019M NOT EVEN GONNA SAY REST IN PEACE BECAUSE IT\u2019S BIGGER THAN DEATH. I NEVER MET THE MAN (I WAS TOO NERVOUS THE ONE TIME I SAW HIM) AND I NEVER SAW HIM PLAY LIVE, REGRETTABLY. I ONLY KNOW THE LEGENDS I\u2019VE HEARD FROM FOLKS AND WHAT I\u2019VE HEARD AND SEEN FROM HIS DEEP CATALOG OF PROPELLANT, FEARLESS, VIRTUOSIC WORK. MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT HE LEARNED EARLY ON HOW LITTLE VALUE TO ASSIGN TO SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S OPINION OF YOU.. AN INFECTIOUS SENTIMENT THAT SEEMED SOAKED INTO HIS CLOTHES, HIS HAIR, HIS WALK, HIS GUITAR AND HIS PRIMAL SCREAM. HE WROTE MY FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME, \u2018WHEN YOU WERE MINE\u2019. IT\u2019S A SIMPLE SONG WITH A SIMPLE MELODY THAT MAKES YOU WISH YOU THOUGHT OF IT FIRST, EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE - A FLIRTATIOUS BRAND OF GENIUS THAT FEELS APPROACHABLE. HE WAS A STRAIGHT BLACK MAN WHO PLAYED HIS FIRST TELEVISED SET IN BIKINI BOTTOMS AND KNEE HIGH HEELED BOOTS, EPIC. HE MADE ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HOW I IDENTIFY SEXUALLY SIMPLY BY HIS DISPLAY OF FREEDOM FROM AND IRREVERENCE FOR OBVIOUSLY ARCHAIC IDEAS LIKE GENDER CONFORMITY ETC. HE MOVED ME TO BE MORE DARING AND INTUITIVE WITH MY OWN WORK BY HIS DEMONSTRATION - HIS DENIAL OF THE PREVAILING MODEL\u2026HIS FIGHT FOR HIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - \u2018SLAVE\u2019 WRITTEN ACROSS THE FOREHEAD, NAME CHANGED TO A SYMBOL\u2026 AN ALL OUT REBELLION AGAINST EXPLOITATION. A VANGUARD AND GENIUS BY EVERY METRIC I KNOW OF WHO AFFECTED MANY IN A WAY THAT WILL OUTRUN OBLIVION FOR A LONG WHILE. I\u2019M PROUD TO BE A PRINCE FAN(STAN) FOR LIFE.\"\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n\"I came out of an event in Hartford, Connecticut, and people told me, and I was so stunned,\" she said. \"You think of him as being almost eternal. I mean he was a bigger-than-life personality, he was not only a songwriter and a singer but literally a one-man band. He was such a great showman. I just was so, so sad. And I just want everybody to spend some time reflecting on this American original. He was so extraordinary.\"\n\nPatti LaBelle\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by Prince's untimely passing. Not only was he a dear friend to me, but an inspiration. His talent, artistry and influence are unparalleled and there will never be another like Prince! The world has suffered a great loss! May he rest in everlasting peace.\"\n\nR. Kelly\n\n\"My thoughts are the same as everybody else's thoughts; First, I'm stunned and then just sad over the thing,\" Kelly told Billboard shortly after the news broke. \"I'm just shocked, man. I'm still stunned about the whole situation, man.\"\n\nBob Seger\n\n\"It's so sad. He was way too young. And he was kind of an athlete, such a great performer. You wouldn't expect it. ... He was just an off-the-charts talent -- instruments, songwriting, singing, performing, producing. You name it, he could do everything. My son loves [Trent] Reznor, and I told him, 'Before there was Reznor, there was Prince.' And of course I've heard stories that James Brown did that stuff, too; He would play drums, bass, could do just about it all. So it was kind of a progression. It's unusual to have somebody be that talented on so many instruments and yet still be a really good producer, songwriter \u2014 everything. ...It's a damn shame, it really is. I know he had greatness still ahead of him. I'm just glad he was around. He was a gift to music.\"\n\nDonatella Versace\n\n\"I am crying. All my memories are coming back to me. He was one of my closest friends. I will always remember when he rented a club, only for him and me. We listened to his music and spoke about the young generation. The young people were so important to Prince. They have to follow the example he set, to believe in their heart, respect their own soul and never trade their own individuality. It is what made Prince outstanding and relevant forever. I will always love him.\"\n\nCameron Strang, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Records\n\nToday, we lost one of the most revolutionary talents of our time. Prince\u2019s untimely passing is deeply shocking, reminding us that unique artists who chart their own course and move culture are precious few and irreplaceable. He leapt onto the scene in 1978 and it didn\u2019t take the world long to realize that pop music had changed forever. He played the studio like an instrument and shattered the definition of live performance. He defined a new kind of superstardom, with a transformative impact not just on music, but on video, film, and style. Prince was the epitome of cool and mystery - an inspirational soul who created his own universe by bringing together different genres, races and cultures with a purity of sound and spirit unlike any other. His visionary gifts as a songwriter, vocalist, musician, performer and producer placed him in a league all his own. We are honored to have had Prince as a member of the Warner Bros. Records family during two eras of his astonishing career. We express our deepest condolences to everyone who loved him and join his family, friends and legion of fans in mourning his loss.\n\nCarmen Electra\n\n\"I was so shocked and heart broken to hear about the loss of my mentor, Prince. The world has lost a truly incredible spirit and musical genius. What a blessing it is to be one of the chosen ones who had the chance to work so closely with him. He gave me my name, he believed in me, and he has inspired an entire generation. I will always love him\u2026. \u201cSometimes it Snows in April.\"\n\nGeorge Miller\n\n\"We used one of his songs in 'Happy Feet'. We wanted to change two words of his lyrics to suit the penguins. He asked to see the movie. As it finished he picked up his guitar and said he wanted to write a song for us. It arrived completed soon after. As I was about to listen to it for the first time I thought 'what if I don't like it?'. How do I tell this legendary figure his song doesn't fit? A few seconds in I began to smile. By the end I was dancing. It was perfect. A true genius and a true gentleman. He called me 'mister' I wanted to call him 'your majesty'. Such an astonishing loss.\"\n\nAlbert Magnoli, Writer, Director and Editor of Purple Rain\n\n\"The news of Prince\u2019s sudden and unexpected passing is very difficult to process. He was my creative partner and friend. We shared tremendous times together during and after the making of Purple Rain. I know his fans are devastated. I know his music meant so very much to so many people. He was a good man, complicated and diligent, and like men of his caliber, he always demanded from himself and others the very best. Travel well, friend, wherever your next journey takes you.\"", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/princes-death-hollywood-mourns-legendary-886479", "title": "Hollywood Pays Tribute to Legendary Artist Prince", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Shonda Rhimes, Justin Timberlake, Chris Rock and more expressed their sadness on social media.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/princes-death-hollywood-mourns-legendary-886479", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Hollywood Pays Tribute to Legendary Artist Prince", "description": "Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Shonda Rhimes, Justin Timberlake, Chris Rock and more expressed their sadness on social media.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Hollywood Pays Tribute to Legendary Artist Prince", "description": "Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Shonda Rhimes, Justin Timberlake, Chris Rock and more expressed their sadness on social media.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/princes-death-hollywood-mourns-legendary-886479", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Hollywood Pays Tribute to Legendary Artist Prince", "sailthru.description": "Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Shonda Rhimes, Justin Timberlake, Chris Rock and more expressed their sadness on social media.", "sailthru.author": "THR Staff", "sailthru.vertical": "Music", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-21 10:26:48", "sailthru.tags": "Music,Culture,Prince,Obituaries"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461205608.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
