The report says that the barge will have several \"facilities of the original Titanic, including a ballroom, theater, swimming pool and premium first class rooms,\" but no word yet on if it will include the car where Jack and Rose got naughty and fogged up the windows. China Daily reports that the project will cost 1 billion yuan ($145 million) and already has booked visitors. The report says that \"preorders for overnight stays were first accepted in Hong Kong in June 2005, with tickets for a one-night, economy-class stay starting at about 3,000 yuan ($435), and the price for a luxury fare amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan.\" A pretty steep price to pay without the luxury of seeing Leo himself. Though it could definitely be a must-visit for die-hard Titanic fans. You can follow the New Titanic's Twitter account for updates on the project and to find out when your heart can go on IRL.", "images": ["https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/1bf/0,204,3087,1621/x,80/1703568/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg"], "top_img": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/1bf/0,204,3087,1621/x,80/1703568/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leah Marilla Thomas", "Ineye Komonibo", "Anne Cohen", "Kathryn Lindsay", "Gina Vaynshteyn", "Morgan Baila", "Kaitlin Reilly", "Titanic Real Life Replica China Tourist Attraction Leo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/12/131656/titanic-replica-iceberg-crash-china", "title": "Titanic Real Life Replica China Tourist Attraction Leo", "meta_data": {"title": "Titanic Real Life Replica China Tourist Attraction Leo", "description": "Get ready to party like it's 1912.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/12/131656/titanic-replica-iceberg-crash-china", "title": "Wanna Party Like It's 1912?
