The rapper publicly said he had contemplated committing suicide in 2010.\n\n\"The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest/Today I seriously thought about killing you/I contemplated, premeditated murder/And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so.\"\n\nYikes\n\nWest references his opioid addiction after getting liposuction and confirms he has bipolar disorder.\n\n\"I can feel the spirits all around me/I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me/They know I got demons all on me.\"\n\n\"That's my bipolar s***, n**** what/That's my superpower, n**** ain't no disability/I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!\"\n\nAll Mine\n\nThe star references his sister-in-law Khloe Kardashian and boyfriend Tristan Thompson's cheating scandal. Thompson cheated on a then pregnant Kardashian, and it turned into a media frenzy.\n\n\"All these thots on Christian Mingle/Almost what got Tristan single.\"\n\nWouldn't Leave\n\nThe Kardashians are known for the way they handle themselves publicly. They do major PR damage control, and West references his wife Kim Kardashian-West's reaction to the comments he made about slavery during a TMZ interview.\n\n\"I said, 'Slavery a choice.' They say, 'How, Ye?'/Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day.\"\n\n\"Wife calling screaming saying we're about to lose it all/I had to calm her down cause she couldn't breathe/I told her she could leave me now but she wouldn't leave.\"\n\nNo Mistakes\n\nKanye had to drop out of his Saint Pablo Tour in 2016, and was hospitalized after a psychological breakdown.\n\n\"Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard/I had dead on my books, it's been a shaky a** year.\"\n\nViolent Crimes\n\nThe song writer references his fears about raising daughters, and the way they'll grow up in our society. He also references one of his favorite movies, Meet the Fockers.\n\n\"Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates/Just play piano and stick to karate/I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's\"\n\n\"Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers/I'll beat his a**, pray I beat the charges.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/global/theme/images/nexstar-logo-white-nmg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/04/12/Kanye%20West%2C%202015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards_25614989_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://api.b2c.com/api/noscript-3822h1xdo2bjghb73i1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://media.yourphx.com/nxsglobal/yourphx/theme/images/Yourphx-Logo-2018.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/http://www.yourphx.com/nxs-main-v2-theme/images/placeholder/placeholder-16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/04/12/Kanye%20West%2C%202015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards_25614989_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/global/theme/images/placeholder/placeholder-16x9.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/04/12/Kanye%20West%2C%202015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards_25614989_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Valeria Quintana"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102/http://www.yourphx.com/community/decoding-kanye-west-s-ye-lyrics/1213689562", "title": "Decoding Kanye West's 'Ye' Lyrics", "meta_data": {"author": "Valeria Quintana", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "All hail Yeezus.&nbsp;", "keywords": "kanye west,album,scandal,controversial,kardashians,ye, kim kardashian west, lyrics, decode, what do they mean, Community,News,Download,30 Second Download", "og": {"title": "Decoding Kanye West's 'Ye' Lyrics", "description": "All hail Yeezus.", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102/http://www.yourphx.com/community/decoding-kanye-west-s-ye-lyrics/1213689562", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/04/12/Kanye%20West%2C%202015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards_25614989_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "YOURPHX"}, "fb": {"app_id": 391226331062612}, "article": {"section": "Community", "tag": "album, scandal, controversial, kardashians, kanye west, kim kardashian west, ye, lyrics", "published_time": "2018-06-04T19:14:13+0000", "modified_time": "2018-06-04T19:14:12+0000", "expiration_time": "2292-03-15T23:33:00+0000"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Decoding Kanye West's 'Ye' Lyrics", "description": "All hail Yeezus.", "site": "YOURPHX", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180621233102im_/https://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/04/12/Kanye%20West%2C%202015%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards_25614989_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "domain": "http://www.yourphx.com"}, "google-site-verification": "dewO0GF3x1P-f-uFeGZBhljVGIVS7AbpIIhFd8Hh5us"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528139653.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
