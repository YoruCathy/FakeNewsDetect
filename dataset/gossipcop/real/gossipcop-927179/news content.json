The Beckhams attended their wedding in May 2018 and even joined the royal couple on the Australian leg of their tour in later October, so you would think Markle throwing on a VB ensemble would be a no-brainer. However, that\u2019s not the case. So why isn\u2019t the former actress willing to wear her pal\u2019s dresses?\n\nWhile it seems odd that the retired actress isn\u2019t supporting Mrs. Beckham\u2019s creations she actually has a good reason for it. Here\u2019s why you won\u2019t see Markle in any VB dresses, plus the advice and recommendations the former Spice Girl gave to the duchess when she first moved to London.\n\nWhy Markle won\u2019t wear Victoria Beckham dresses\n\nMeghan Markle | Getty Images/Pool Meghan Markle | Getty Images/Pool\n\nThe former Suits star won\u2019t wear any of her friend\u2019s dresses simply because they don\u2019t look good on her. She explained that while she is a fan of Beckham\u2019s dresses she doesn\u2019t have the frame for them to fit her properly.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m starting to learn is, even though things look amazing on the hanger, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to look amazing on me,\u201d she said in an interview with Glamour UK in 2017. \u201cFor example, I love Victoria Beckham dresses, but I don\u2019t have the long torso to support that silhouette.\u201d\n\nShe has worn VB designs before\n\nMarkle proved in the past that she does indeed like other pieces in Beckham\u2019s collection. For example, she posed in a VB sweater in one of her and Prince Harry\u2019s official engagement portraits so it is just the dresses she can\u2019t wear.\n\nSome other designers the duchess has frequently worn include Carolina Herrera, Dior, Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, Altuzarra, and of course Givenchy, which is the fashion house that produced her wedding gown.\n\nBeckham told Markle exactly where to go\n\nVictoria Beckham and David Beckham | Chris Radburn \u2013 WPA Pool/Getty Images Victoria Beckham and David Beckham | Chris Radburn \u2013 WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nWhile Markle didn\u2019t need any help with her fashion game, she was a little lost about where to go for a facial and blowout when she first moved abroad. Luckily, Beckham helped her out with that by reportedly giving her a complete list of the most exclusive salons to go to.\n\n\u201cMeghan has been really pleased with Victoria\u2019s beauty recommendations and has her to thank for meeting new friends in London,\u201d a source told The Sun. \u201cVictoria told Meghan to visit Sarah Chapman, who bills herself \u2018London\u2019s most sought-after facialist\u2019. Meghan trusts and appreciates her advice.\u201d\n\nRead more: From Meghan Markle and Prince Harry to Victoria and David Beckham: How These Celebrity Couples First Fell in Love\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Victoria-Beckham-2-e1541613175676-356x500.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/meghan-markle-smiling-e1541617276678-640x400.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Victoria-Beckham-2-e1541613175676-356x500.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960041176-e1541617130427-640x449.jpg?x62514"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Victoria-Beckham-2-e1541613175676-356x500.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Kapusta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-meghan-markle-says-she-will-never-wear-a-victoria-beckham-dress.html/", "title": "Why Meghan Markle Says She Will Never Wear a Victoria Beckham Dress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-meghan-markle-says-she-will-never-wear-a-victoria-beckham-dress.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Meghan Markle may be friends with Victoria Beckham but the duchess has admitted that she won't wear any of the designer's dresses.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Meghan Markle Says She Will Never Wear a Victoria Beckham Dress", "description": "Meghan Markle may be friends with Victoria Beckham but the duchess has admitted that she won't wear any of the designer's dresses.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-meghan-markle-says-she-will-never-wear-a-victoria-beckham-dress.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "updated_time": "2018-11-07T20:22:25-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Victoria-Beckham-2-e1541613175676-356x500.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Victoria-Beckham-2-e1541613175676-356x500.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "Meghan Markle", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-11-07T20:01:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-07T20:22:25-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Meghan Markle may be friends with Victoria Beckham but the duchess has admitted that she won't wear any of the designer's dresses.", "title": "Why Meghan Markle Says She Will Never Wear a Victoria Beckham Dress", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Victoria-Beckham-2-e1541613175676-356x500.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541638880.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
