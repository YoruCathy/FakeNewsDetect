The manner of her death, however, is in question.\n\nOn conservative activist Brandon Straka's YouTube show Walk Away, Barr said Roseanne Conner will \"die of an opioid overdose.\"\n\nThe character having an opioid problem was set up on Roseanne last season, as she started taking pain pills after a knee injury. But Barr is not pleased with the direction she says The Conners will take. ABC declined comment.\n\n\"I wanted to show it in the show,\u201d Barr said, referring to a possible addiction storyline. \u201cBut I was never going to have Roseanne die of an opioid overdose. It\u2019s so cynical and horrible. She should have died as a hero or not at all.\"\n\nThe need to write Barr out of the show, of course, arose because ABC canceled Roseanne after Barr's racist tweet aimed at former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett in late May. After striking a deal whereby Barr wouldn't be involved in any spinoff, ABC ordered 10 episodes of The Conners for the fall.\n\nThe show is set to premiere Tuesday, Oct. 16, at 8 p.m. ET/PT.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2018/03/147831_6411_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2018/07/headshot2.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/01/greg_berlanti_sharon_horgan_alex_kurtzman_and_dwayne_johnson_-_getty_-_h_2020.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2018/09/conners.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/03/mrs._america_-_publicity_still_1-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/07/roseanne_barr_at_roseanne_premiere_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2018/07/roseanne_barr_at_roseanne_premiere_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/07/roseanne_barr_at_roseanne_premiere_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rick Porter", "Rick.Porter Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-barr-spoils-how-her-character-dies-conners-1144423", "title": "Roseanne Barr (Maybe) Spoils Her 'Conners' Exit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "ABC has no comment on what Barr says is Roseanne Conner's fate on spinoff 'The Conners.'", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-barr-spoils-how-her-character-dies-conners-1144423", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Roseanne Barr (Maybe) Spoils Her 'Conners' Exit", "description": "ABC has no comment on what Barr says is Roseanne Conner's fate.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/07/roseanne_barr_at_roseanne_premiere_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Roseanne Barr (Maybe) Spoils Her 'Conners' Exit", "description": "ABC has no comment on what Barr says is Roseanne Conner's fate.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-barr-spoils-how-her-character-dies-conners-1144423", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/07/roseanne_barr_at_roseanne_premiere_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Roseanne Barr (Maybe) Spoils Her 'Conners' Exit", "sailthru.description": "ABC has no comment on what Barr says is Roseanne Conner's fate.", "sailthru.author": "Rick Porter", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2018-09-17 16:46:05", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, Roseanne Barr, Roseanne, The Conners"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537173965.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
