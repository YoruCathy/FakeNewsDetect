I\u2019m impressed, and had I not just walked 850 feet uphill in a sweatshirt, I might have managed more than a \u201cwow, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d But I\u2019m winded and red-faced, and can\u2019t believe I have to meet his dad, a god of the late nineties, looking like a tomato.\n\nThese days, Ulrich, 47, is known as Jughead\u2019s jailbird father, FP Jones, on The CW murder-mystery Riverdale, but his career has spanned more than two decades, popping off in 1996 with roles in The Craft, in which he played a high-school creep put under a love spell, and Scream, in which he played a serial killer who somehow made fake blood look finger-licking good. (\u201cCorn syrup,\u201d the line goes. \u201cSame stuff they used for pig\u2019s blood in Carrie.\u201d) Leave it to a shrink to unpack the how and why of Billy Loomis\u2019s sex appeal (I\u2019d say it\u2019s the greasy hair) \u2014 Ulrich was just trying to act.\n\nScream. Miramax\n\n\u201cThis was when you received hard fan mail, and there would be trash bags full of letters, so I was aware that I had a popularity,\u201d he tells me from his couch, where his dog Lua, who is smaller than my forearm, flops around like a Beanie Baby come to life. \u201cAs to where I sat on the heartthrob scale, I had no [idea]. There was no real barometer. You go on Instagram now and, yeah, we all know Cole [Sprouse, who plays Jughead] is a heartthrob. It\u2019s very obvious.\u201d If only Skeet Ulrich saw the inside of my middle-school notebooks.\n\nUlrich was married to actress Georgina Cates by the age of 27 and moved to a farm in Virginia not long after. (He and Cates have twins, Jakob and Naiia, born in 2001; the couple divorced in 2005.) He rarely walked red carpets because he hates getting his picture taken. \u201cI never look how I thought I\u2019d look,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like, I think I look pretty good tonight. And then I see the picture and I\u2019m like, Oh, I was very wrong.\u201d He was the only star of Scream absent from the stage at the MTV Movie Awards when the Wes Craven horror film took home Best Movie (it was up against Romeo + Juliet). The fame was \u201cnot something I was interested in,\u201d he says. \u201cI was really interested in doing things that challenged me.\u201d\n\nThe Newton Boys. 20th Century Fox via Getty Images\n\nHe took roles in James L. Brooks\u2019s As Good as It Gets (1997), Richard Linklater\u2019s The Newton Boys (1998), and Ang Lee\u2019s Ride With the Devil (1999), and says he passed on movies like Armageddon (the role went to Ben Affleck) and Face/Off (the role went to Alessandro Nivola). It's as if he was borrowing from Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Guide to Rejecting Leomania: no matter how hot teens think you are, do not make movies they'll care about.\n\n\u201cI see Leo around quite a bit,\u201d Ulrich says. \u201cHe\u2019s always very nice. He\u2019ll stop conversations he\u2019s having to come say hi to me, so whatever bond we formed 20 years ago, it still has relevance to both of us.\u201d The guys hung out back in the day, after DiCaprio\u2019s friend, magician David Blaine, came to live with Ulrich for about six months. But when I inquire about the infamous Pussy Posse, DiCaprio\u2019s clique of womanizing party boys whose members included Lukas Haas, Tobey Maguire (with whom Urlich starred in Ride With the Devil), and Blaine, Ulrich looks puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d\n\nAs thrilling as it is to recount the glory days of the nineties, at least for me (Ulrich seems more animated when talking about how much he hates Trump \u2014 \"he's got to be impeached before he destroys the world\" \u2014 or how much he loves Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Mother! than he does his past), there\u2019s a more serious matter to discuss. Nine days prior to our meeting, the New York Times published an article alleging that producer Harvey Weinstein, whose long list of movies includes Scream, had been sexually harassing women for decades, reportedly trying to coerce actresses to watch him shower, among other horrors. The New Yorker followed the story with its own chilling report that included allegations of sexual assault, the Times ran additional harassment accounts from Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, and there have been other accusations since. (Weinstein has denied many of the allegations, including \"any allegations of non-consensual sex,\" according to The New Yorker.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew,\u201d Ulrich admits. \u201cMost people knew. I had dinner with someone who is one of the most famous women on the planet \u2014 I won\u2019t say who it is \u2014 who has not come out, who told me similar things.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t do anything about it, he says, because \u201cthere is nothing you can do. I mean, What am I gonna do? I can\u2019t step up, certainly then, on allegations. Honestly, and I think it\u2019s what most people faced: How do you cut your livelihood from a very powerful corporation on something that you don\u2019t know what the facts are? Now that it\u2019s starting to come out and people are finally stepping up and saying stuff, I\u2019m glad. That\u2019s what it takes. Because one person stepping up and making allegations is gonna hurt that one person and not help anyone, especially [against] someone with that power.\u201d\n\nAmong the most outspoken of Weinstein\u2019s accusers is Ulrich\u2019s Scream co-star Rose McGowan, who claimed on Twitter that Weinstein raped her (Weinstein denies the allegation). The Times had previously reported that Weinstein paid her a financial settlement of $100,000 in 1997 for an unspecified \u201cepisode.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing you can do. I mean, What am I gonna do? I can\u2019t step up, certainly then, on allegations.\n\n\u201cI saw her about a year ago and that was the only time I\u2019d seen her since like \u201999 or something,\u201d Ulrich says. \u201cNone of this [news] was out at that time, so it certainly wasn\u2019t anything I was going to bring up with her. It wasn\u2019t even in my thought process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat industry is safe?\u201d he adds. \u201cWhere is a beautiful woman, or any woman, free to walk down the street and not be a feast to some asshole\u2019s eyes? I see how men can be. And then you give a man power? It\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nUlrich has a stillness about him throughout our conversation. He\u2019s even-keeled, restrained, and says \u201cbless you\u201d every time his publicist, who\u2019s sitting at the dining-room table, sneezes. My interest in him was renewed not only because of his role in Riverdale, but because of his touchy-feely social media activity. He leaves breathlessly supportive comments on his children\u2019s Instagram posts \u2014 \u201cLove this shot!!!\u201d \u201cSo cool!!!\u201d \u201cYou are ALWAYS a ray of sunshine.\u201d Despite not knowing him personally, Busy Philipps once shouted him out in an Instagram story, praising him for putting his acting career on hold to raise his kids. Ulrich says he didn\u2019t watch the story, but someone told him about it. \u201c[She said] I left the business or something?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cI left a great deal of opportunities because I couldn\u2019t work outside of L.A. with [my kids] being little.\u201d The limitations were \u201cfrustrating,\u201d he admits, declining to comment on the twins' mother. \u201cI had such a nonexistent father, I knew that if I did have kids I would never allow them to feel unwanted.\" The result is a tight-knit family that\u2019s expanded to include his fianc\u00e9e, Brazilian model Rose Costa, and her son, Luca (his father is James Marsden), who will be 5 in December.\n\nThe Craft. United Archives GmbH / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nUlrich was born Bryan Ray Trout in Lynchburg, Virginia, but spent most of his childhood in North Carolina; he took his last name from his first stepfather and got the nickname \u201cSkeet\u201d from a coach who noticed the boy\u2019s small build. (He had open-heart surgery when he was 10 and frequently fell ill with pneumonia.) It wasn\u2019t until Ulrich transferred to New York University from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, where he was studying marine biology, that he began acting in earnest, starting out in theater under the tutelage of playwright David Mamet, then moving into film. \u201cMy god, most of my beginning films, like Boys, the first one, I was horrific,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I thought I was really bad in The Craft. I was like, This is horrible.\u201d (He doesn\u2019t know anything about the possible quasi remake, but says he \"got paid a usage fee for some clip that they\u2019re using in it, from the original. Whether that\u2019s still in there or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d)\n\nEarly in his career, Ulrich was relentlessly compared to Johnny Depp. \u201cAll the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly worse people to be compared to \u2026 I always thought he was a very good-looking guy.\u201d But the talent digs stung. \u201cIt hurt when people compared our acting and [said] I\u2019m not half the actor he is,\u201d Ulrich says. \u201cAnd yet I think I\u2019ve done some stuff he couldn\u2019t do. He also did \u2014 what was it called, [with] Angelina Jolie? The Tourist. So we all have \u2018em.\u201d\n\nJericho. Getty\n\nUlrich allows that his own IMDB profile began to \u201cwaiver\u201d by the early 2000s. \u201cI stockpiled some money on a couple of movies I shouldn\u2019t have been a part of,\u201d he says. On top of that, \u201cI\u2019m sure [my distance from the scene] hurt me in the long run \u2014 when you\u2019re not in producers\u2019 faces, when you\u2019re not at the parties and all that stuff, it took its toll, for sure. But I wouldn\u2019t trade it.\u201d\n\nHe made his shift to TV in 2003 with ABC\u2019s Miracles, which got canceled after six episodes. Then there was CBS's Jericho (2006), which got pulled after one season, brought back by popular demand, and shut down again; a 2010-11 stint on Law & Order: L.A. (he got killed off); and a string of pilots that never saw the light of day. If you take all that work into consideration, Riverdale isn\u2019t Ulrich\u2019s comeback \u2014 he never went anywhere. But the CW show is his first project in quite some time that \u201chas a bubbling about it,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s the only set I\u2019ve been on in my 20-something years doing this where you have to wade through a couple hundred people to get on the set.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time Ulrich\u2019s played a dad (not counting the series that were dead on arrival). When I point out the irony of such a good dad playing such a bad dad, he disagrees. \u201cI think he\u2019s a great dad without means. To me, the summation of FP Jones is \u2018sometimes good people do bad things for the right reasons.\u2019 What I love about him is he\u2019s clearly the most blue-collar of anyone on that show. He\u2019s the working class, he\u2019s the coal miner, the construction worker. He\u2019s the guy who\u2019s shit upon day in and day out by society, and that was evident through the first season.\u201d\n\nRiverdale. The CW\n\nNext up are a small part in Ryan Murphy\u2019s Versace: American Crime Story and a role in Lifetime\u2019s I Am Elizabeth Smart movie, narrated by Smart, in which he\u2019ll play Brian David Mitchell, the man who kidnapped her at knifepoint from her home in 2002. \u201cIt was stressful for both of us,\u201d he says of his first meeting with Smart. \u201cI think the producers\u2019 intention was [that] we would meet before I went into the hair and makeup chair, and it didn\u2019t happen and nobody was there to sort of foster us along. She walked in and you could feel her breath just stop.\u201d\n\nBefore I leave, we take a field trip to the family\u2019s chicken coop, which Ulrich constructed with help from Riverdale co-stars KJ Apa (who plays Archie) and Sprouse. \u201cI think everybody looks for distractions outside of the work and the business and the press,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I had it readily available here and they jumped right in.\u201d Ulrich also builds furniture, including a coffee table he made out of teak and birch plywood, the dining-room table, kitchen cabinets, and a console.\n\nRiker Brothers\n\nWe walk down the driveway and back up along a narrow path \u2014 me, Ulrich, his publicist, Jakob, and Luca. (Naiia and Rose are out this morning.) \u201cDad, you know I saw two deers before?\u201d Luca says on our way to meet Clucky, Marilou, Heihei (a nod to Moana), and Coco. \u201cI know,\u201d Ulrich says encouragingly. \u201cRight there?\u201d \u201cRight behind our chicken coop!\u201d He also saw hawks and a bald eagle. Jakob retrieves five eggs from the coop and picks up Heihei so I can pet her.\n\nEarlier, I\u2019d asked Ulrich if his kids are embarrassed by his public displays of fatherhood. \u201cNever. Not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re great human beings.\u201d Jakob likes racing (Ulrich\u2019s family has NASCAR roots). \"If he doesn\u2019t know how to do something, he\u2019s like me: he researches until he understands it, and then does it.\u201d And Naiia wants to be an actress. \u201cI refuse to let her just jump into the business part without proper training, because if you want a career at it, you need to know what you\u2019re doing, and so we\u2019re trying to find the right things for her to study and where.\u201d\n\nUlrich bends to show Luca some Swiss chard. It\u2019s in the midst of a garden that\u2019s looking otherwise rough, given that he\u2019s not had much time to tend to it. It\u2019s not as if he\u2019s gone for stretches of time or anything; he typically shoots Riverdale in Vancouver two days a week. But the hours he does have with his family are precious and sometimes, that means the leafy greens have to wait. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any rule [for how long I can be gone],\u201d he says. But if he had it his way? \u201cI\u2019d say a day. Because home \u2026 it\u2019s heaven to me what we have here.\u201d\n\nFollow Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/skeet-ulrich-1951-vhg-1508252691.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.749531542785759xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/skeet-ulrich-1951-vhg-1508252691.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.749531542785759xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patti Greco", "Patti Greco Is A Freelance Writer", "Editor Based In Brooklyn."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a13030127/skeet-ulrich-riverdale-profile/", "title": "Skeet Ulrich Went From '90s Heartthrob to Struggling TV Actor.
