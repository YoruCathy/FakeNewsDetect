of which he's served in the honourable role since 1953 - so it came a fitting closure to the end of a busy year for the Royals.\n\nIn August, the Duke of Edinburgh attended a parade at Buckingham Palace to mark the Royal Marines 1664 Global Challenge, making it his 22,219th solo official engagement, carried out since 1952.\n\nCongratulations, Harry!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/2048x1024/landscape-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/4000x2000/landscape-1513762225-gigi-bella-models.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/48/1600x800/landscape-1511787018-meghanmarkleweddingdress.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/2048x1024/landscape-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40593/prince-harry-promotion-royal-marines-meghan-markle/", "title": "Prince Harry Just Got A Major Royal Promotion Ahead Of Wedding To Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Prince Harry Just Got A Major Royal Promotion Ahead Of Wedding To Meghan Markle", "description": "And it came on behalf of the Queen", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40593/prince-harry-promotion-royal-marines-meghan-markle/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/2048x1024/landscape-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-01 08:15:01", "published_time": "2017-12-20 10:25:18", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/2048x1024/landscape-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Prince Harry Just Got A Major Royal Promotion Ahead Of Wedding To Meghan Markle", "description": "The 33-year-old has just received a royal and military honour, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Prince Philip.", "keywords": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Prince Harry wedding, Meghan Markle wedding, Meghan Markle wedding dress, Prince Philip", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/1024x1024/square-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,Prince Philip,Meghan Markle,prince harry", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-20T10:25:18Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/2048x1024/landscape-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/51/1024x1024/square-1513765019-harry-meghan.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Prince Harry Just Got A Major Royal Promotion Ahead Of Wedding To Meghan Markle", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513736718.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
