That's part of body shaming,\" she added.\n\nTelling someone they don\u2019t deserve to feel insecure because their body is \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cjust like\u201d whomever.. is wrong. That\u2019s part of the problem. That\u2019s part of body shaming. \u2014 Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) July 3, 2018\n\nShe also added that she cannot understand how people can hide behind their social media accounts and tell another person that their feelings are not valid and should be considered as \"whining\" just because they believe that the other person already showed the ideal shape or figure. In another series of tweets, Reinhart said that she was sad to see other people blatantly tell her what she feels. \"Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying 'you're skinny so shut up about embrscing [SIC] your body.' As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. I'm either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure,\" the actress, who is known for portraying the role of Betty Cooper in \"Riverdale,\" stated in her post.\n\nFeeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying \u201cyou\u2019re skinny so shut up about embrscing your body.\u201d As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. I\u2019m either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure. \u2014 Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) July 4, 2018\n\nMental illness gets worse when people say that you don\u2019t have a right to feel the way you do. That\u2019s where we are dailing. Do not encourage this behavior. It is destructive. More destructive than you\u2019ll ever realize. You may not understand someone\u2019s insecurity- but respect it. \u2014 Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) July 4, 2018\n\nMayo Clinic described body dysmorphic disorder as a mental disorder which makes a person believe that there are one or more flaws in their appearance even if others could not see it.\n\nThe actress then appealed to her followers to show more respect to others.", "images": ["https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/241_a_120_80.jpg?0164455001587057137", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/image/12/64/126459_w_760_760.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236331_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236334_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236324_a_963_642_7_7.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236367_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236281_a_130_72_7_7.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/22/57/225791.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236319_a_130_72.png", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/260_a_120_80.jpg?0162822001587057137", "https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/cp.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236275_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236312_a_66_66.jpg", "https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236362_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236345_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236299_a_130_72_7_7.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236327_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236304_a_130_72.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236365_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236251_a_66_66.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236368_a_66_66.jpg", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/235_a_120_80.jpg?0165173001587057137", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/245_a_120_80.jpg?0163733001587057137", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236337_a_130_72.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/22/57/225791.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.christianpost.com/trends/lili-reinhart-opens-up-about-body-dysmorphia-after-trolls-criticize-her-appearance.html", "title": "Lili Reinhart Opens Up About Body Dysmorphia After Trolls Criticize Her Appearance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "2770D3F1DEB25A5BF965224150B525F4", "google-site-verification": "jUJZk866mtO5Gxkt7Qz98Q6XIzxevyn3ngdiSJLpP34", "keywords": "lili reinhart,lili reinhart body dysmorphia,lili reinhart tweets,lili reinhart news,lili reinhart updates", "description": "\"Riverdale\" star Lili Reinhart shared her disappointment over the bashing that she received from social media due to the way she perceived her body.", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 1879686555693183, "pages": 41093998634}, "og": {"url": "https://www.christianpost.com/trends/lili-reinhart-opens-up-about-body-dysmorphia-after-trolls-criticize-her-appearance.html", "type": "website", "title": "Lili Reinhart Opens Up About Body Dysmorphia After Trolls Criticize Her Appearance", "description": "\"Riverdale\" star Lili Reinhart shared her disappointment over the bashing that she received from social media due to the way she perceived her body.", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/22/57/225791.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost", "creator": "@ChristianPost", "title": "Lili Reinhart Opens Up About Body Dysmorphia After Trolls Criticize Her Appearance", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/22/57/225791.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530806400.0, "source": "https://www.christianpost.com", "summary": ""}
