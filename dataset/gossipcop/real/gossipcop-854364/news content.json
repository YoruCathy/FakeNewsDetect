I used to use so much crap in my hair.\u201d\n\nToday, a less is more approach has served her well both off and on the stage, where she made headlines for competing in curls. In the midst of competing, the 25-year-old stuck to a simple routine that she continues to use a month into her reign.\n\n\u201cThis Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream ($13, sephora.com); I love that. And I also have Chi Biosilk ($20, jcpenney.com).\u201d She continued, \u201cAnd when it came to on stage presence, I always had a teasing comb or brush, to get the roots really good. And just some holding spray. That\u2019s what really helped me keep the hair bigger, so it didn\u2019t look like it was flat on stage.\u201d\n\nAs for her makeup routine, K\u00e1ra isn\u2019t afraid to admit that she\u2019s still learning to perfect her beat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very hard on myself,\u201d she shared with ESSENCE. I\u2019ll see these looks; especially these editorial looks and I\u2019m like, \u2018oh my gosh, I want to look like that.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI would give myself a good seven [out of ten] because I know there\u2019s still like such an area of improvement that I want for myself.\u201d\n\nFor now, she\u2019s depending on a few Sephora faves, like the Laura Mercier Translucent Powder and the NARS Lip Pencil (\u201cIt\u2019s like lip gloss almost. Those are my favorite!\u201d) to keep her camera-ready.\n\nShop all of McCullough\u2019s beauty must-haves below and learn more about her journey to the Miss USA title here.", "images": ["https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image/2017/06/main/morrocan.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rgb-TAG-Registered-80px.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497036724/GettyImages-684260376.jpg?width=1920&height=1080", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497033464/miss-usa-4.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497036724/GettyImages-684260376-900x600.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497033464/miss-usa-3.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497033464/miss-usa-5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497036724/GettyImages-684260376-900x600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/beauty/beauty-products-tools/miss-usa-kara-mccullough-beauty-must-haves/", "title": "Miss USA Kara McCullough Beauty Favorites", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Even pageant queens can't resist a trip to Sephora!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "<p>All Of Miss USA K\u00e1ra McCullough's Beauty Must-Haves Are Under $40</p>", "description": "Even pageant queens can't resist a trip to Sephora!", "url": "https://www.essence.com/beauty/beauty-products-tools/miss-usa-kara-mccullough-beauty-must-haves/", "site_name": "Essence", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497036724/GettyImages-684260376-900x600.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1497036724/GettyImages-684260376-900x600.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/essence"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2453509358209265}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Even pageant queens can't resist a trip to Sephora!", "title": "<p>All Of Miss USA K\u00e1ra McCullough's Beauty Must-Haves Are Under $40</p>", "site": "@essence", "creator": "@essence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-essence-fav-icon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.essence.com", "summary": ""}
