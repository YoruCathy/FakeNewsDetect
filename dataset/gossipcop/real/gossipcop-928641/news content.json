It turned out Rowan (Joe Morton) didn\u2019t shoot her after all.\n\n\u201cI knew Quinn wasn\u2019t dead, and it was kind of special and amazing and emotional to get an episode like [\u2018Robin\u2019] where I just got to see those flashback moments of Quinn to see how she\u2019s grown and changed in the last seven years,\u201d Lowes tells Variety. \u201cIt was really rewarding in a sick way.\u201d\n\nSince Lowes actually was pregnant during production, the show shot episodes out of order with \u201cGood People\u201d going ahead of \u201cRobin\u201d so that she could \u201cgo off and have [her] baby.\u201d Knowing the true fate of her character didn\u2019t make shooting the episode completely easy, though.\n\n\u201cI remember coming into the first day of the episode and talking to the director and saying, \u2018How the hell am I going to do this?\u2019 It\u2019s my life, it\u2019s my baby\u2019s life, it\u2019s my wedding day. I\u2019m actually nine and a half months pregnant [in real life]. And she was amazing and such a leader,\u201d Lowes says of Nzingha Stewart. \u201cWhat was great about her is that she\u2019s a director that doesn\u2019t take a billion takes, so I knew I could really go balls to the wall and leave it all on the dance floor three to five times but not have to do it 30 times.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood People\u201d revealed Rowan kept Quinn in a bunker, where she pleaded for her life, clutching her pregnant stomach and saying that in B613 it was supposed to be \u201cmothers and children first, that\u2019s the rule\u201d \u2014 but then railed against Rowan for his inability to see that Olivia would never trade and that doomed both her and her unborn daughter.\n\n\u201cThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Lowes says of \u201cGood People.\u201d\n\nWhen Olivia showed up at Rowan\u2019s and the father-daughter duo engaged in a standoff over the fact that he should shoot her but couldn\u2019t, Quinn used a hairpin to unshackle her handcuffs. She was able to surprise Rowan when he came down to the bunker, and she attacked him \u2014 and this time when she begged him not to kill her until after her baby was born, it turned out that \u201cmother and children first\u201d reminder sunk in.\n\nGetting so physical while pregnant was \u201chorrifying\u201d at first for Lowes, but when it came to the day of shooting the actual scene, she shares she felt \u201cvery well taken care of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a medic on set at all times [and] we had an OB on set who was instructing me on how to do everything really safely, which was incredible,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cWe had our stunt coordinator \u2014 I had a stunt double \u2014 and we took things really slow. I felt very safe.\u201d\n\nShortly after the fake shooting, Quinn went into labor and had the baby with a little help from Rowan, his salesman friend who was previously a war medic, as well assome hallucinations of her friends.\n\n\u201cThe craziest part of the episode was me actually being nine and a half months pregnant with a blanket over my knees, and they put a real baby in between my legs and pulled the baby out like it was really happening. And I was like, \u2018Oh my God, guys, this is going to really be happening to me in a few weeks!'\u201d Lowes says. \u201cThey had a real baby and a fake baby \u2014 the real baby so they could get a cry and the fake was covered in grape jelly and cottage cheese. But that\u2019s how they make it look like a baby was just born.\u201d\n\nThe new mother and daughter moved into Liv\u2019s old room in Rowan\u2019s house to lay low and allow Olivia to continue to believe she was dead \u2014 so she wouldn\u2019t come looking for her to actually kill her.\n\n\u201cNzingha was very much [about] finding moments where \u2014 especially when the baby comes and he had bought all of the clothes for her \u2014 Quinn is filling this huge void for Papa Pope,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cAnd similarly, Quinn didn\u2019t have a father either. And then they are so allied in the end in that they both followed the B613 rules, which is that they put a woman and pregnancy before anything else.\u201d\n\nLowes says Rowan and Quinn are now bonded because they \u201cdefinitely need each other at the moment,\u201d and subsequent episodes of \u201cScandal\u201d will dive into how that plays out. Last the show left Rowan in present day, Charlie (George Newbern) was attacking him over the baby he found in his house, demanding to know whose it was. Lowes says the eventual family reunion between Charlie and Quinn is \u201cnot what you\u2019d expect\u201d \u2014 not even for \u201cScandal.\u201d\n\nAs for whether or not Quinn and Rowan will work together to try to take down Olivia, and soon bring Charlie into that fold, Lowes would only say \u201call the loyalties and family dynamics\u201d would unfold soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s like one we\u2019ve seen on television before,\u201d she says.\n\nBut while Quinn was once super loyal to Olivia and in many ways was even \u201cwaiting around for her to save\u201d her while she was down in that bunker, after overhearing Olivia allow her and her baby\u2019s murder, her feelings toward her former mentor are \u201cvery complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for her to wrap her head around the fact that Olivia\u2019s responsible for blowing up the plane with that young girl on it. I think it\u2019s very hard for her to admit that the Olivia she knows and loves is not here right now,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cI think the line is, \u2018Olivia\u2019s a bitch\u2019 and I think that\u2019s way too light, honestly. I love the moment because how do you find the words to describe someone that is responsible for killing you and your unborn child and being fine for it for the Republic? I don\u2019t know how a relationship comes back from it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEven after such an emotional fake-out death episode, Lowes doesn\u2019t have strong feelings about whether or not Quinn survives the series, which is ramping up for its finale in April.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been such a cog in this huge wheel for seven years, and I\u2019m just very used to Shonda making the best decisions for the characters,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cI know Quinn is mine, but she\u2019s also hers, and I just feel like whatever she wants for her is what I will come to terms with.\u201d\n\n\u201cScandal\u201d airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. on ABC.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147507_5204.jpg?w=1024", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fscandal-good-people-katie-lowes-quinns-fate-rowan-robin-1202676635%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202676635&comment_count=5", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147507_5204.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danielle Turchiano"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/scandal-good-people-katie-lowes-quinns-fate-rowan-robin-1202676635/", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 Star Katie Lowes on What Really Happened to Quinn: \u2018The Stakes Couldn\u2019t Be Higher\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Katie Lowes talks about filming \"Scandal\" while being nine months pregnant &amp; what happened to Quinn when she went missing on her wedding day", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202676635, "author": "Danielle Turchiano", "pmc-category": "Features,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-01-25T19:00:30"}, "pmc-tag": "Katie Lowes,Scandal", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 Star Katie Lowes on What Really Happened to Quinn: \u2018The Stakes Couldn\u2019t Be Higher\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "Features", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 Star Katie Lowes on What Really Happened to Quinn: \u2018The Stakes Couldn\u2019t Be Higher\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/scandal-good-people-katie-lowes-quinns-fate-rowan-robin-1202676635/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT:\u00a0Do not read if you have not yet watched the Jan. 25 episode of \u201cScandal\u201d entitled \u201cGood People.\u201d After an episode (\u201cRobin\u201d) that saw Olivia Pope (\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147507_5204.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1200, "height": 802, "alt": "SCANDAL - \"Good People\" - The harrowing events that transpired in Rowan's basement are revealed, from the moment Quinn was kidnapped to the earth-shattering gunshot that rocked Olivia to her core, on \"Scandal,\" airing THURSDAY, JAN. 25 (9:00-10:00 p.m. EST), on The ABC Television Network.
