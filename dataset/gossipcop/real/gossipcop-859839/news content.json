Throw that assumption out the damn window. For seven Playboy cover models, at least, there's no time like the present to revisit their former snaps, as they proved in a shoot by Ryan Lowry and Ben Miller for the magazine. As chief creative officer Cooper Hefner (oh yes, there's a relation) relays in an Instagram video, it is in fact what he gave his mother for Mother's Day.\n\nTurn up your \ud83d\udd09: We re-created some of our most iconic covers and one our models happened to be @cooperbhefner's mom. Look out for the cover reveal on 6/4. A post shared by Playboy (@playboy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 6:30pm PDT\n\n\"In the spirit of celebrating the women who\u2019ve made Playboy what it is \u2013 an exuberant celebration of beauty, sex, and the beauty of sex \u2014 we invited seven special Playmates from over the years to come back and recreate their iconic covers. In the process, they remind us that beauty is ageless, sex appeal is timeless and exuberance is eternal,\" notes the article. And frankly, we couldn't agree more. Take a look, for example, at Kimberley Conrad Hefner (former wife of Hugh Hefner and mom of Cooper, as well as Marston), in her 1988 cover, and today.\n\nConrad Hefner, who was raised partially in West Vancouver, was 26 at the time of her original shoot \u2014 she's now 54 and divorced from Hef, but still has fond memories of her time at the Mansion. \"There was a common misconception that I put the kibosh on the partying at the Mansion. It had nothing to do with me. The Playmates still came over, but it was nice to have them call and say, \u2018Hi! I\u2019m coming up!\u2019\" she told the publication. Renee Tenison was the magazine's first African-American Playmate of the Year in 1990.\n\nShe was 22-years-old at the time, and is now 49. Of course, it's somewhat ridiculous it took until that point to have any diversity on the cover, but Tenison remembers a different kind of squabble. \"When I did Playboy, there was a little bit of controversy because I was the first African-American Playmate of the Year and some women were saying I was being objectified. But I said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re pro-choice, shouldn\u2019t I have the right to choose what I want to do?\u2019 .. If you look back, all the big models from Christy Turlington to Naomi Campbell posed nude. I see it as art. Not everybody sees it that way, but that\u2019s how I see it,\" she told the magazine. Lisa Matthews, billed as the \"all-American girl,\" took on the task in June 1991.\n\nShe was 22-years-old at the time (perhaps that's the magic Playboy cover model number?), and is now 48. Then there's Candace Collins, who has the oldest cover in the bunch.", "images":
