She loves him, and she knows he loves her desperately,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey\u2019ll get back together and they\u2019ll get married the way they always should have: something small, intimate, for only the closest family and friends. Not some huge circus that will spook John or make him feel like he\u2019s a performing monkey \u2014 something that can be about just the two of them.\u201d\n\nAdded the source, \u201cThe wedding they called off no longer felt like their wedding \u2014 it was a wedding for TV, a wedding for publicity, a wedding for the fans and for viewers almost. That\u2019s what made them able to walk away from it \u2014 it didn\u2019t even feel like their day anymore, and it was already so tainted by the arguments and bad feelings that lead up to it and during the planning of it. In the end, calling it off is going to be the best thing that ever happened to their relationship.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1539&h=806&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fjohn-cena4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1539&h=806&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fjohn-cena4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-and-john-cena-officially-back-together/", "title": "Nikki Bella and John Cena Are Officially Back Together \u2014 Six Weeks After Calling Off Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,John Cena,News,Nikki Bella,TV", "news_keywords": "Couples,John Cena,News,Nikki Bella,TV", "description": "\u201cThey were always going to find their way back to each other,\" a source tells PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "Nikki Bella and John Cena Are Officially Back Together \u2014 Six Weeks After Calling Off Wedding", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-and-john-cena-officially-back-together/", "description": "Nikki Bella and John Cena have rekindled their relationship.
