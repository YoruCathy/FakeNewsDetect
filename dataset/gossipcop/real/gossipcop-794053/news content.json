The incident occurred as Lochte was receiving one of the judge's critique of his dance routine.\n\n\"Two individuals stormed the dance floor tonight and were immediately subdued and escorted out of the building,\" a spokesperson for the company that produces \"Dancing with the Stars,\" BBC Worldwide Productions, told CNN.\n\nLochte joined Season 23 of \"Dancing With The Stars\" after a spate of negative publicity he received for admitting he \"over-exaggerated\" claims that he and fellow swimmers were robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro\n\nAlthough the show was live, the actual incident was not shown on camera by ABC.\n\nAt least one audience member was able to record the moment security guards tackled Soroudi and Sotoodeh and posted video to social media.\n\nAnother angle of Lochte protesters on #DWTS #DancingWiththeStars\n\n\n\nWhy does this remind me of a Trump rally \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/YKCwT5dirE \u2014 DCHomos (@DCHomos) September 13, 2016\n\nThroughout the brief incident, the camera stayed focused on judge Carrie Ann Inaba, who yelled \"Excuse me!\" multiple times as clamor rose in the audience and onstage.\n\n\"Off! Off!\" she yelled, gesturing for the intruders to get off stage.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lochte: 'I over-exaggerated' Olympics robbery story Replay More Videos ...

Bergeron thanked the security team on the show.\n\nHe also asked Lochte how he was doing after the interruption.\n\n\"I'm a little hurt\"\n\n\"So many feelings are going through my head right now,\" said the Olympic swimmer. \"I'm a little hurt.\"\n\nAfter the show, Lochte told CNN that he was saddened by what happened.\n\n\"You know, at that moment, I was really heartbroken,\" he said. \"My heart just sunk. It felt like somebody just ripped it apart.\"\n\nBut Lochte added he \"had to brush it off.\"\n\n\"Completely shocked\" but \"beyond\" proud of him\n\n\"I had to realize that I came out here in front of millions. I did something that I did not know how to do -- I don't know how to dance,\" he said. \"And I gave it my all and I'm glad I did it and I'm glad I'm here.\"\n\nHis dancing partner, Burke, said she was \"completely shocked\" but \"beyond\" proud of him.\n\nCNN crews captured two suspected protesters outside of the event being led away in handcuffs. They both wore T-shirts that contained a red circle with a slash going through the word Lochte. One man called Lochte \"a liar.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the company that produces \"Dancing with the Stars,\" told CNN that \"the matter is now being handled by the authorities.\"\n\nOfficial statement from BBC Worldwide Productions spokesperson re: Lochte protestors on #DWTS pic.twitter.com/7ret4u4ds5 \u2014 Sandra Gonzalez (@TheSandraG) September 13, 2016\n\n\"Saddening and disheartening\"\n\nLochte's fellow cast members rallied around the Olympic champ after Monday's incident.\n\nProfessional dancer Witney Carson, who this year is paired with Robert Van Winkle, known best as Vanilla Ice, said she'd never seen anything like the incident during her time on the show.\n\n\"I think it was just saddening and disheartening more than anything because this is such a positive show and we're all about putting people in a positive light,\" she said. \"For somebody to want to ruin that for Ryan is just really, really hard.\"\n\n\"He's a hero and a great guy on top of that\"\n\nVan Winkle also offered Lochte his support.\n\n\"He won the gold medal for this country, folks. Get over the bull story, whatever. It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"He's a hero and he's a great guy on top of that.\"\n\nFormer NFL wide receiver Calvin Johnson, Jr. told CNN the \"unfortunate\" event no doubt put \"a damper\" on Lochte's debut, but said he gave his fellow dancer a pep talk backstage.\n\n\"You know, you have to keep pushing, have another great week next week,\" he said. \"It sucks to have somebody like that in the crowd do those kinds of things. Nobody's perfect. Everybody makes mistakes.\"\n\n\"Dancing with the Stars\" airs Mondays on ABC.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chloe Melas.", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818150047-rio-police-presser-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160820195210-ryan-lochte-nbc-intv-sot-christine-brennan-beeper-00001305-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160817170212-olympic-swimmers-ryan-lochte-robbed-rio-2016-pkg-nannes-pkg-00010903-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160819083857-brazil-us-swimmers-gas-station-saga-walsh-dnt-rio-olympics-00012408-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818011609-gunnar-bentz-jack-conger-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160817150829-feigen-lochte-split-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160821075511-ryan-lochte-matt-lauer-swimming-ban-response-sot-00000816-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140110095143-ryan-lochte-0110-story-top.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818230811-us-swimmers-usoc-apology-statement-00014423-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818191027-ryan-lochte-smiling-1-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160913001407-ryan-lochtes-dancing-with-the-stars-debut-interrupted-by-protesters-01-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818125030-surveillance-swimmers-gas-station-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130404081253-ryan-lochte-2012-olympics-day-1-story-top.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818145748-lochte-gas-station-new-surveillance-thumbnail-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818161042-us-athletes-robbed-cevallos-analysis-nr-sot-00000301-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160913001407-ryan-lochtes-dancing-with-the-stars-debut-interrupted-by-protesters-01-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160814132827-ryan-lochte-0812-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160818125651-us-swimmer-rio-gas-station-video-00013705-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160820103533-04-ryan-lochte-t1-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140110095143-ryan-lochte-0110-story-top.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Park", "Sandra Gonzalez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/entertainment/ryan-lochte-dancing-with-the-stars/index.html", "title": "Audience members crash Ryan Lochte's debut on 'Dancing with the Stars'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "entertainment", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2016-09-13T03:44:23Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/entertainment/ryan-lochte-dancing-with-the-stars/index.html", "title": "Audience members crash Ryan Lochte's debut on 'Dancing with the Stars'", "description": "Protesters rushed the stage after Ryan Lochte's first performance on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" interrupting the live show Monday evening.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140110095143-ryan-lochte-0110-story-top.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "pubdate": "2016-09-13T03:44:23Z", "lastmod": "2016-09-13T18:27:33Z", "author": "Madison Park and Sandra Gonzalez", "twitter": {"title": "Audience members crash Ryan Lochte's debut on 'Dancing with the Stars'", "description": "Protesters rushed the stage after Ryan Lochte's first performance on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" interrupting the live show Monday evening.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140110095143-ryan-lochte-0110-story-top.jpg"}, "description": "Protesters rushed the stage after Ryan Lochte's first performance on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" interrupting the live show Monday evening.", "keywords": "Ryan Lochte, DWTS, entertainment, Ryan Lochte rushed by protesters during DWTS - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140110095143-ryan-lochte-0110-story-top.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/12/entertainment/ryan-lochte-dancing-with-the-stars/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "entertainment,art-vid-vls-col,col-us-swimmers-incident-in-rio"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1473609600.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
