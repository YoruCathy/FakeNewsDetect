Bookout shares oldest son, Bentley, 9, with Edwards.\n\nThe order of protection will not affect his ability to see their son Bentley, Turner said as it will give him \u201ca lot more protection against any false allegations, allows him to avoid getting arrested without a hearing first, and allows him to be around his son most importantly.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Edwards and Bookout did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe mother of three initially filed for an order of protection in March and listed her three children, Jayde, Maverick and Bentley in the protection order.
