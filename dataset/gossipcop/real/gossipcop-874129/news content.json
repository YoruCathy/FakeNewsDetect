He did get baptized.\u201d\n\nKemper revealed James was baptized in May, when he was 10 months old \u2014 and she was a little concerned that he might be too big for the priest to manage. Apparently, young James did scream, but all turned out well \u2014 even when he grabbed a shard of glass at his grandparents\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cAn hour after the baptism,\u201d Kemper said, \u201cI found James with a shard of glass in his hand! It was in my parents\u2019 house \u2026He was miraculously unhurt. I don\u2019t know if he was testing God. I don\u2019t know what the point was, but I mean, he turned out OK. I don\u2019t know if it was a sign.\u201d\n\nKemper then finished off with a bravura, more grown-up (but still clean!) rendition of the song played by her son\u2019s favorite toy.\n\nHere\u2019s the whole thing. Enjoy!\n\nCongrats to Ellie, Michael and James, who seems to have gotten a good start on life.\n\nImage: Courtesy CBS\n\nLearn more about Family Theater Productions\u2019 upcoming, new and vintage productions as well as our Hollywood Outreach Programs; and, of course, you\u2019ll find us on Facebook.
