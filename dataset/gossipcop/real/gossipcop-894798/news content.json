While self-isolating at home, we're googling recipes that bring back memories of youth and put the \"comfort\" in comfort food. And according to search trends, banana bread is king.\n\nSo we thought we'd re-share one of our favorite comfort foods from our favorite model-turned-cookbook author and social media aficionado, Chrissy Teigen.\n\nTeigen had Twitter going gaga when she sent out a call to action to her followers in the Los Angeles area back in September 2017.\n\nShe needed six brown bananas, \"not four, not five,\" but six brown bananas. She was in the midst of researching and testing recipes for her latest cookbook, \"Cravings: Hungry for More\" (Clarkson Potter).\n\nAccording to Teigen, \"perfecting this single recipe took me nearly a year. That\u2019s why I needed so many damn bananas.\" Luckily, it will only take you an hour and 15 minutes to actually prepare and bake it.\n\nStaying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nEasy bread recipes you can make in quarantine:Even if you're out of yeast, milk or butter\n\nSo for those looking for a new twist on an old classic and the perfect recipe for those ripening bananas, we present the recipe that took Twitter, and readers, by storm.\n\nCoronavirus:100 little things that bring us joy during the pandemic\n\nFive ingredients or less:Easy recipes you can make during coronavirus quarantine with five ingredients or less\n\nTwitter's (And Uncle Mike's) Banana Bread\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 cups mashed very ripe bananas *\n\n4 eggs\n\n2\u20443 cup canola oil, plus a little more to grease the pan\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus a little more for dusting the pan\n\n2 cups sugar\n\n1 (3.5-ounce) box vanilla instant pudding mix **\n\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt\n\n1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut\n\n1 (3.5-ounce) bar dark chocolate, chopped into chunks\n\nSalted butter, for serving\n\nDirections\n\nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.\n\nIn a large bowl, combine the mashed bananas, eggs, and oil. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, pudding mix, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and combine well BUT GENTLY. I swear this came out differently when I used an aggressive electric mixer. Fold in the coconut and chocolate chunks.\n\nGrease and flour a Bundt pan (that means wipe a little grease all over the inside of the pan, dust it with flour, and tip it upside down to shake out any extra flour). Pour the batter into the pan. (This can also make two 8 \u00d7 4-inch loaves, but it\u2019s so much more moist in one Bundt pan!)\n\nBake until the cake springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. (Test it with a toothpick at around 50 minutes.) Let it cool slightly in the pan, then use a butter knife to gently release the cake from the sides of the pan and around the inner circle, then flip it onto a plate.\n\nLet it cool and cut it into slices. Rewarm them and serve them with salty butter!!\n\n* Get six brown bananas. Not four. Not five. Six. You will think you only need five because it looks like enough, but it will not be enough. You will get five, you will mash them, you will be about half an inch short and that makes a difference and you cannot get around it. Trust me.\n\n** I won\u2019t tell you what brand to use, but the right brand rhymes with smello. Don\u2019t use banana-flavored pudding mix. I tried it. It is gross.\n\nRecipes and photographs reprinted from Cravings: Hungry for More.
