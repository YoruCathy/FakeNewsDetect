Only you can let it in. No one else, no one else, can speak the words on your lips.\"\n\nShe then takes a moment and tells her baby boy, \"Sonny, this is momma's song.\"\n\nThe video comes eight years after the reality show, which ran for six seasons, aired its final episode on July 13, 2010. Port, however, left The Hills after season four to star in her own spin-off, The City, which aired from 2008 to 2010.\n\nSince then, the Los Angeles native tied the knot with Tim Rosenman in November 2015, and they welcomed their son, Sonny, on July 27, 2017.\n\nET caught up with Port earlier this year, where she revealed that she's down for a Hills reboot -- minus the \"fake drama.\"\n\n\"I'm down to get back together with everybody,\" Port said, days after Kristin Cavallari shared on Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag's podcast that she'd be open to a reunion. \"I feel like it would have to depend on what it was.\"\n\nHear more of what she said in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nWhitney Port Is Down for a 'Hills' Reboot (Exclusive)\n\nWhitney Port Breaks Down in Tears Over Breastfeeding: 'It Started to Get Incredibly Painful'\n\nWhitney Port Gives Birth to Baby Boy -- Find Out His Cute Name!\n\nWhitney Port Is Down for a 'Hills' Reboot Minus the 'Fake Drama' (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
