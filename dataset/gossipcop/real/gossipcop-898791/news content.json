Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nThe trailer for the third and final (I\u2019ll believe when I see it) installment in the Pitch Perfect franchise has finally arrived \u2014 and with it, immense waves of Pitch Perfect nostalgia. (Isn\u2019t it wonderful to be alive at a time when a \u201cPitch Perfect franchise\u201d is a real thing?) According to that new trailer, Pitch Perfect 3 promises more of what we\u2019ve all come to expect from the Pitch Perfect movies: organized nerd singing, mash-ups of songs we didn\u2019t know we needed but now can\u2019t live without (hello \u201cWake Me Up\u201d and \u201cZombie\u201d), and, of course, the inexplicable but always adorable use of \u201caca\u201d as a prefix. In honor of this beloved aca-tradition, Vulture has gone ahead and made a list of all the plays on \u201caca\u201d and \u201cpitch\u201d in the franchise thus far. No, this is not a joke. We\u2019re Dixie Chick serious.\n\nPitch Perfect\n\nThe seminal movie about college students making sweet, sweet music with their mouths, and the bonds of sisterhood overcoming any obstacle \u2014 even when that obstacle is a gorgeous solo from Ben Platt. The original Pitch Perfect introduces us to the world of competitive collegiate a cappella singing through Anna Kendrick\u2019s Beca, a freshman who pretty much hates everything and is honestly, a real bitch, until she meets the Barden Bellas and learns that singing covers and having a solid group of lady friends is good for the soul. She also learns \u2014 thanks to Anna Camp\u2019s Aubrey \u2014 that a cappella is very serious, and to show that seriousness, a person should use \u201caca\u201d as a prefix or \u201cpitch\u201d in a punny way whenever possible.\n\n\u201cAca-scuse me?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like the first time, is there? This is aca-enthusiast Aubrey to Beca after Beca makes fun of a cappella during the Activities Fair. It is laced with as much attitude as you imagine.\n\n\u201cMy fellow aca-people, we will not let egotistical, big-headed garbage dirtballs \u2014 whoever you may be \u2014 get in our way. I promise you we will return to the ICCAs and finish what we started last year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest, pitches: Aubrey is the best character in the Pitch Perfect franchise and she never gets the recognition she deserves. Don\u2019t aca-at me.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well, look who\u2019s in treble!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u201caca\u201d or \u201cpitch\u201d related, but of all the puns the Treblemakers get out of their group name, this one, used on initiation night, is the best. It\u2019s worth it for Adam Devine\u2019s line reading alone. Bumper is the worst, but also kind of the best, right?\n\n\u201cLadies, welcome to aca-initiation night.\u201d\n\nAubrey has things to do and covers of songs to arrange, she cannot waste the syllables on \u201ca cappella initiation night.\u201d This usage is simply about brevity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of those a cappella girls. I\u2019m one of those a cappella boys. And we\u2019re gonna have aca-children. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\nSlow your roll, Jesse! The way to any college girl\u2019s heart is not to immediately talk about having children, aca or not.\n\n\u201cHands in aca-bitches!\u201d\n\nAubrey to the Bellas for their first group huddle. \u201cAca\u201d is a very versatile prefix, used here as a term of endearment.\n\n\u201cI know you have a toner for Jesse.\u201d\n\nAh, yes, the moment in which we all learned that \u201ctoner\u201d is the term for a \u201cmusical boner,\u201d and also learned that \u201cmusical boner\u201d is a thing, I guess. Never tell me Pitch Perfect isn\u2019t educational.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be aca-awesome.\u201d\n\nChloe is the yin to Aubrey\u2019s yang, and when Aubrey is freaking out about how unprepared the Bellas are for their gig at the Sigma Beta Theta Fall Mixer, Chloe knows to talk her friend off the ledge via use of her favorite prefix. Of course, they go on to bomb the Sigma Beta Theta Fall Mixer, but that is neither here nor there. Also, them being so bad gives us one of the greatest lines in the movie: \u201cThis makes my beer taste bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cAca-scuse me?\u201d\n\nYup, it\u2019s your girl Aubrey, back with her standard reply to anyone who threatens her a cappella way of life. This time, it\u2019s after Chloe suggests that Beca may be onto something when she complains about the Bellas never trying anything new. Beca is right, but there are more tactful ways to go about it. So yes, Chloe and Beca, ACA-SCUSE YOU.\n\n\u201cThe Sockapellas\u201d\n\n\u201cProving that it doesn\u2019t get better for everyone after high school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAca-scuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAca-believe it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the sitch: The Bellas are on their way to the ICCA Semi-Finals, but run out of gas \u2026because Fat Amy forgot to fill the tank after being attacked by a burrito at the hands of her true love, Bumper. Aubrey has every right to \u201caca-scuse\u201d her teammate, and honestly, I don\u2019t appreciate Fat Amy\u2019s tone here. Is she making light of the \u201caca\u201d prefix?\n\n\u201cYou guys are gonna get pitch-slapped so hard, your man boobs are gonna concave.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Fat Amy with a great burn for Bumper, after he teases the team over their dated semi-finals set list. For a movie called Pitch Perfect, they do not use \u201cpitch\u201d wordplay nearly enough. It fits into so many phrases! #PitchPlease\n\n\u201cAca-huddle, now!\u201d\n\nThis is, of course, Aubrey, signaling to us that aca-huddles are way more serious than normal huddles.\n\n\u201cThe aca-gods have looked down on us and they have given us a second chance.\u201d\n\nI wish Aubrey would go more into detail as to who these \u201caca-gods\u201d are once she receives news that the Bellas have won a spot at Nationals, thanks to a technicality. Are the \u201caca-gods\u201d Pentatonix?\n\n\u201cAca-awkward.\u201d\n\nYes, Fat Amy, it is \u201caca-awkward\u201d when Aubrey tells her BFF Chloe to get her head out of her ass because \u201cit\u2019s not a hat,\u201d in front of the whole group. Excellent word choice.\n\n\u201cShut your eyes and get rid of all the aca-politics.\u201d\n\nJohn and Gail are back at Nationals, and they really know how to set the scene. Am I the only one who cries throughout the entire Bella finale performance?\n\n\u201cListen up, aca-ballers!\u201d\n\nYour final \u201caca\u201d fix of the film comes courtesy of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the saddest audition coordinator there ever was. Let this dude sing! LET HIM LIVE.\n\nPitch Perfect 2\n\nPitch Perfect 2 doubles down on the Fat Amy jokes, but, surprisingly, not so much on the \u201caca\u201d wordplay. The sequel sees our girls prepare for and then (of course) win the A Cappella World Championships. The Bellas main competition this go-around comes from Das Sound Machine, a German a cappella group full of superhumans who are no doubt better than all of us at everything. Pitch Perfect 2 also features a very cute subplot about Benji falling for the newest Bella, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), and reminds us that no one would hate it if the Pitch Perfect franchise was about the power of lady friendship first, then Benji\u2019s revenge second.\n\nThe \u201caca\u201d prefix is used sparingly, but for the most part, in much more creative ways than in the first film; they don\u2019t blow their aca-wad all at once.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Talk-apella\u201d\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite a cappella commentators, Gail and John, are back \u2014 and this time with a podcast called Let\u2019s Talk-apella. Honestly, that\u2019s a great name. How has it not been taken before? Surely, there must be people clamoring for an a cappella\u2013based podcast, right?\n\n\u201cThose deutsch-bags!\u201d\n\nFat Amy uses this clever wordplay to cut to the core of the Bellas German nemeses. Moments before, she praises the musical legacy of David Hasselhoff, so don\u2019t go thinking Fat Amy has a vendetta against all Germans. It\u2019s just this one, very specific, very good-looking group of Germans who want to crush her friends\u2019 dreams of making music with their mouths.\n\n\u201cO-M-aca-G!\u201d\n\nBaby Bella Emily fits right in with her new a cappella sisters: She is also a complete weirdo.\n\n\u201cAca-wiedersehen, bitches!\u201d\n\nOne of the best running gags of Pitch Perfect 2 is that Anna Kendrick\u2019s Beca is completely smitten with the leaders of Das Sound Machine, even when she wants to be angry. She attempts to \u201caca\u201d her way out of a confrontation with her enemies/crushes, and although she gets props for aca-ing in a second language, this does nothing to help the Bella\u2019s cause.\n\n\u201cYou are such a disa-aca-pointment.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay Packers offensive tackle David Bakhtiari says this to teammate Clay Matthews after Matthews blanks during the country song round in an underground a cappella league riff-off. Is that the greatest sentence ever written?\n\n\u201cI almost burnt to death because of you aca-bitches.\u201d\n\nAfter another disastrous performance, Cynthia Rose knows there\u2019s nothing like a classic to really insult your friends. Classics are classics for a reason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Copen-hating this place.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an aca-word, but as the Bellas arrive in Denmark for the A Cappella World Championships, one has to wonder: Shouldn\u2019t this be Copenhagen\u2019s tourism slogan?\n\n\u201cTonight, groups from around the globe duke it out for the title of Aca-World Champions.\u201d\n\nI mean, this one seems pretty valid.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/26/26-pitch-perfect-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/26/26-pitch-perfect-2.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/26/26-pitch-perfect-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Fremont"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/every-aca-pun-in-the-pitch-perfect-movies.html", "title": "Every \u2018Aca\u2019 Pun in the Pitch Perfect Movies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Every Time \u2018Aca\u2019 Is Used As a Prefix in the Pitch Perfect Movies", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/every-aca-pun-in-the-pitch-perfect-movies.html", "description": "We\u2019re Dixie Chick serious about this.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/26/26-pitch-perfect-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Every \u2018Aca\u2019 Pun in the Pitch Perfect Movies", "description": "We\u2019re Dixie Chick serious about this.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/26/26-pitch-perfect-2.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-26T21:13:02.600Z", "tag": "movies, pitch perfect, pitch perfect 2, pitch perfect 3, anna kendrick", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "A list of every pun used in the Pitch Perfect movie franchise, starring Anna Kendrick and Anna Camp.", "sailthru.tags": "movies, pitch perfect, pitch perfect 2, pitch perfect 3, anna kendrick", "author": "Maggie Fremont", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506460382.6, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
