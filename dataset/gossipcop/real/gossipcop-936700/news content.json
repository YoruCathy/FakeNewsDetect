The Colombian star was recently asked if there was anything brewing between them and is definitely excited to make it happen. \u201cSelena, please, what\u2019s the status!?\u201d he asked, laughing in an interview with ET. \u201cWe were in touch! I told her that I wanted to work with her and I don\u2019t know why the things [froze]. She was working on her album, I don\u2019t know, but it would be a pleasure to have the opportunity to work with her.\u201d\n\nIf a collab doesn't happen with Gomez, Maluma has other dream artists he would like to work with including Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber.\n\nSelena Gomez has been working some issues with her mom recently after they seemingly had a fallout over the popstar getting back together with Justin Bieber. \u201cSelena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy,\u201d Mandy Teefey told Gossip Cop. \u201cEvery mother and daughter has disagreements. She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed. Selena is an adult and can make her own choices.\u201d\n\nMandy Teefey was hospitalized in December 2017 and initial reports suggested it was after a fight she had with her daughter over her relationship with Justin Bieber. Those rumors turned out to be false and Teefey was admitted voluntarily and going through a stressful time. \u201cIt\u2019s been a stressful time for Mandy and she made the decision herself to go to the hospital and make sure everything was okay. This wasn\u2019t just about Justin,\u201d a source told People, adding \u201cIt\u2019s true her family doesn\u2019t approve of Justin, but this wasn\u2019t just over a fight about him.\u201d\n\nSelena Gomez getting back together with Justin Bieber has been an issue with her family as their previous breakup caused a lot of pain for the \"Wolves\" hitmaker. \u201cJustin knows Selena\u2019s family is not happy about her dating him,\u201d the insider says. \u201cHe has known for a long time. But he is adamant that he has changed and is a better boyfriend now. He will keep trying to prove himself to her family. He is sad that her mom is not doing well. Selena is very close with her mom, so it\u2019s stressful for her. He wants Selena to be happy.\u201d", "images": ["https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2018/02/01/selena-gomez-maluma.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2018/02/01/selena-gomez-maluma.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latintimes.com/maluma-selena-gomez-duet-colombian-star-gives-update-collab-431452", "title": "Maluma, Selena Gomez Duet?
