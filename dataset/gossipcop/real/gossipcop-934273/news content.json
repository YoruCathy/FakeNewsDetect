The good news is that while we wait for another record Gomez has given fans a gift. On Thursday she dropped a new track called \u201cBack to You,\u201d which is a part of the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack from season two.\n\nThere might not be a music video for \u201cBack to You\u201d just yet\u2014there is a lyric video\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t imagine how great it\u2019ll be. As fans wait for 13 Reasons Why\u2018s second season to premiere on Netflix\u2014Gomez is the executive producer on the show\u2014they can listen to its soundtrack.\n\nWatch\n\nInside Jennifer Aniston & Selena Gomez\u2019s Friendship\n\nAs fans of the former Disney Channel star and her music career you can relive her best music videos below. We know it\u2019s not as good as getting a full CD of fresh tracks from Gomez, but it\u2019ll do. In fact, after scrolling through her best music videos including, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d you can cast your vote on which one you love most in our poll.\n\nGomez has a lot of hits so it won\u2019t be easy to decide which video is the best of the best, but you can do it. Plus, it\u2019s fun to go back through the \u201cBad Liar\u201d singer\u2019s videos because it\u2019s like taking a trip back through your childhood AKA it\u2019s a win-win!\n\n\u201cBad Liar\u201d\n\nThe 2017 video for \u201cBad Liar\u201d is one of the most movie-like videos Gomez has ever done. It takes you back to the \u201970s with the style and as Gomez goes through her school day it\u2019s totally relatable. Plus, Gomez plays all of the leads including a man, a cool girl\u2014complete with Farrah Fawcett locks\u2014and your average teen.\n\n\u201cHands to Myself\u201d\n\nIf you thought Gomez couldn\u2019t do sexy then you haven\u2019t seen this music video. \u201cHands to Myself\u201d is saucy, sexy and full of spice from the singer. She shows off her killer bod in her lingerie, dances in a Risky Business ensemble and rides a motorcycle with Christopher Mason, who is extremely good looking. This is all before she lounges in her tub and channels her inner pop diva.\n\n\u201cKill Em With Kindness\u201d\n\nSometimes the simplest videos are the best. That is the case with \u201cKill Em With Kindness.\u201d It begins with Gomez sitting and singing with a photography backdrop behind her. You then see roses and flashes and simple dress changes, which just works. The entire video is in black and white and it\u2019s just so sophisticated.\n\nPhotos\n\n4 Selena Gomez-Inspired Outfits for Spring\n\n\u201cCome & Get It\u201d\n\nWe will never stop loving this music video. Gomez\u2019s style in this video is impeccable. From her corseted black dress to the saucy red number we are in love with her ensembles. The fashion mixed with the epic dance moves in beautiful locations make this one of the artist\u2019s best videos ever.\n\n\u201cFetish\u201d\n\nOkay, so \u201cFetish\u201d is a little bit of a confusing video, but from beginning to end you\u2019re intrigued. What\u2019s happening? The character that Gomez portrays is a little bit of a mess and we\u2019re not exactly sure what time period this is supposed to be. The photography is funky and fun. Paired with Gomez\u2019s great acting skills and outbreaks throughout the video has us hooked\u2026even if we\u2019re lost.\n\n\u201cSlow Down\u201d\n\nThis song is such a party jam and the video fits that vibe perfectly. Seeing Gomez looking fierce in a car on her way to a club and then watching the dance scenes are so fun. We want to dance every time we hear this track and clearly that\u2019s the point based on the video. It\u2019s fierce and shows Gomez as a total boss.\n\n\u201cLove You Like a Love Song\u201d\n\nThis song is an oldie but goodie and the video is top notch. Gomez takes over the karaoke stage in this video with big and bold curls and wow. She then gets trippy on us and goes into a whole different world complete with purple backdrops and warrior duds. Oh, and who could forget Gomez\u2019s Marie Antionette costume in the middle? It\u2019s so bizarre and wonderful at the same time.\n\nPhotos\n\nSelena Gomez\u2019s Best Coach Looks\n\n\u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants\u201d\n\nThe best thing about this video is the realness of it. It shows the raw and soft side of Gomez and it pulls at our heartstrings. The pain in Gomez\u2019s face is moving and hits us hard no matter how many times we\u2019ve watched this video.\n\n\u201cGood For You\u201d\n\nGomez strips down throughout this video both literally and figuratively. She goes nude in a shower scene and stays in simple and minimal outfits to keep the music at the forefront. It\u2019s a fresh-faced Gomez, which we love on a real and intriguing level. It might be a little boring compared to her action-packed videos but we like the break from action.\n\n\u201cWolves\u201d\n\nWhen Gomez teamed up with Marshmello for \u201cWolves\u201d we expected something unique and we weren\u2019t disappointed. The singer looks glamourous as she sits in a locker room and struts her stuff in that fabulous glitter gown. It\u2019s animalistic, fresh and electric. PS: That diving board scene is amazing.\n\nWatch the 2018 People\u2019s Choice Awards Sunday, Nov. 11, only on E!\n\nSource: Read Full Article", "images": ["https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rs_600x600-180510044550-600.selena-gomez-back-to-you.51018-450x280.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20450'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20743%20489'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201832/rs_600x600-180402114047-600-Selena-Gomez-Blue-Dress-Sneaker.jl.040218.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20639%20404'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rs_600x600-180510044550-600.selena-gomez-back-to-you.51018.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cnews00152468.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ccelebritiesSD-LAB-COMPOSITE-V2.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cfntalk5670.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ccelebritiespjimage-1-1.jpg", "http://c.statcounter.com/11691185/0/36067258/1/", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cnewsfotoskynews-elton-john-coronavirus_4971921.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ccelebritiesPRC_149576034_1587280964.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201026%20577'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201231%20692'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20775%20538'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018113/rs_600x600-180213165846-600-Selan-Gomez-Coach-Front-Row-Group.jl.021318.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90"], "top_img": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rs_600x600-180510044550-600.selena-gomez-back-to-you.51018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/lifestyle/celebrate-selena-gomezs-new-single-back-voting-iconic-music-videos-peoples-choice-awards/", "title": "Celebrate Selena Gomez's New Single Back to You by Voting for Her Most Iconic Music Videos on People\u2019s Choice Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Celebrate Selena Gomez's New Single Back to You by Voting for Her Most Iconic Music Videos on People's Choice Awards | Hot Lifestyle News", "description": "Selena Gomez has released new music and now we need [...]", "url": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/lifestyle/celebrate-selena-gomezs-new-single-back-voting-iconic-music-videos-peoples-choice-awards/", "site_name": "Hot Lifestyle News", "image": {"identifier": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rs_600x600-180510044550-600.selena-gomez-back-to-you.51018.jpg", "secure_url": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rs_600x600-180510044550-600.selena-gomez-back-to-you.51018.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 350}}, "article": {"tag": "Selena Gomez", "section": "Lifestyle", "published_time": "2018-05-11T12:05:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Selena Gomez has released new music and now we need [...]", "title": "Celebrate Selena Gomez's New Single Back to You by Voting for Her Most Iconic Music Videos on People's Choice Awards | Hot Lifestyle News", "image": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rs_600x600-180510044550-600.selena-gomez-back-to-you.51018.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cropped-5-270x270.gif"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526040302.0, "source": "http://hotlifestylenews.com", "summary": ""}
