Not only did Arie Luyendyk Jr. tell two women he loved them, but one contestant\u2019s ex showed up to confront Arie and propose to his lost love. Here\u2019s what you missed.\n\nThird Wheel\n\nAfter a perfect fantasy suite date with Becca, Arie received an unwanted visitor: Becca\u2019s ex, Ross (because of course his name is Ross). Arie\u2019s first reaction was, \u201cWhy is hotel management here?\u201d and that small moment made this entire season worth it. Ross said that he and Becca were soulmates and he traveled all the way to Peru to propose.\n\nArie was sipping-tea mad, but Becca was even more upset when Ross showed up on her doorstep. She claimed that she knew he was going to do this. \u201cThis is just so you,\u201d she said. Becca quickly shot Ross down, and he stormed off fianc\u00e9e-less.\n\nArie worried that Becca might still have feelings for Ross, and the couple seemed to be in a shaky but OK place when all said and done.\n\nThe Ben Higgins Conundrum\n\nArie\u2019s date with Lauren started off rocky. She put her walls back up because, according to her, the stronger her feelings were, the stronger her fears were. Lauren, clearly unfamiliar with the Bachelor process, told Arie, \u201cI need to feel like I\u2019m the only girl that you see.\u201d Arie reassured her and went so far as to tell her he loved her. And he didn\u2019t just say it once. The pair exchanged \u201cI love yous\u201d throughout the night and into the next morning.\n\nBecca and Arie were confident in their relationship heading into their pre-Ross date. Arie called his relationship with Becca \u201cthe safest, most comfortable relationship that I have here.\u201d Before they went to the fantasy suite \u2014 or should we say fantasy tent \u2014 together, Becca told Arie she loved him, and he said it back. Again, multiple times! Arie confessed to the cameras that he was ready to end the show at this point and propose to Becca.\n\nNot Quite There\n\nKendall had a fun date with Arie, but she still didn\u2019t know if she was ready for marriage. She also wanted to make sure Arie wasn\u2019t dating her just because she liked taxidermy. (We\u2019re sure that thought never crossed his mind, but OK.)\n\nThough Arie told Kendall he was falling in love with her during their date, he pulled her aside before the rose ceremony to say that he didn\u2019t think their relationship could get to the same point his other relationships were at. So he let Kendall go and gave roses to Becca and Lauren.\n\nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lauren-b-arie1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/arie-the-bachelor.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C997px%2C523px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-bachelor-final-3.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C997px%2C523px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-bachelor-recap-arie-tells-two-women-he-loves-them/", "title": "'The Bachelor' Recap: Arie Tells Two Women He Loves Them", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Becca's ex tried to win her back and Arie told two women he loved them during the Monday, February 26, episode of \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 \u2014 read Us Weekly\u2019s recap!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'The Bachelor' Recap: Arie Tells Two Women He Loves Them", "description": "Becca's ex tried to win her back and Arie told two women he loved them during the Monday, February 26, episode of \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 \u2014 read Us Weekly\u2019s recap!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-bachelor-recap-arie-tells-two-women-he-loves-them/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-27T13:15:54+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C997px%2C523px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C997px%2C523px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-27T03:01:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-27T13:15:54+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Becca's ex tried to win her back and Arie told two women he loved them during the Monday, February 26, episode of \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 \u2014 read Us Weekly\u2019s recap!", "title": "'The Bachelor' Recap: Arie Tells Two Women He Loves Them", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C997px%2C523px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519700502.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
