The singer recently told The Cut that her body image influences the way she dresses, which we first read about on StyleCaster.\n\n\"I actually have had the pleasure of a fluctuating body type, where one day I can literally fit into something that is body-con, and then the next day \u2014 the next week \u2014 I need something oversized,\" she told The Cut. \"I need a little crop here and a high-waist there to hide that part, you know?\"\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT\n\n\"I really pay attention every day when I go into the closet about what's working for my body that morning.

You having a skinny week? You having a fat week? Are we doing arms this week? We doing legs this week? We doing oversized?\" she said.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 13, 2017 at 1:59pm PDT\n\nRegardless of how she feels, Rihanna said that she sees fashion as something fun.\n\n\"I love to play with silhouettes as well, but I think it's important to make sure that you wear the thing that works for your body the best, and that's flattering,\" Rihanna explained.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 8, 2017 at 8:05pm PDT\n\nNo matter what she's wearing or how she's feeling, we're obsessed with Rihanna's trendsetting, runway-inspired sense of style.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/59ca7e47ba785e6cf76b2d63?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59ca7e47ba785e6cf76b2d63?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susanna Heller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "date": "2017-10-17", "news_keywords": "Style, Fashion, Rihanna, Body Image, Celebrity, Susanna Heller", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "author": "Susanna Heller", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "og": {"title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "image": "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-17", "sailthru.tags": "Style, Fashion, Rihanna, Body Image, Celebrity, Susanna Heller", "sailthru.description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "sailthru.author": "Susanna Heller", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe5?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "control", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "variant", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "59e61e3606fca07c7347cbe7", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508169600.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
