Magazine\u2018s Talents & Legends issue.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Molly\u2019s Game actress had to share with the mag:\n\nOn how her past informs her choices: \u201cMy mom was a single mom; I don\u2019t know who my biological father is, and I grew up in a household that was really financially unstable. There was a turning point in my life where we were living with someone I didn\u2019t like very much, a boyfriend of my mom\u2019s. And he did something\ufffd\u201dmy room was messy or whatever and he had taken my clothes, and I was telling him to give me back my stuff \ufffd\u201dand he slapped me. And I just kicked him in the genitals, and he fell to the ground immediately. It was me, my sister and my brother\ufffd\u201dand I remember looking at my sister\u2019s face, and we were both like, \u2018Oh, my God, what did I just do?\u2019 And then I ran out of the house. But I always look back on that moment as knowing that, OK, if anything happens to me, I\u2019m capable of fighting back. He never messed with me again. If you allow a bully to intimidate or victimize you, they\u2019ll continue to do it. Bullies are actually weak; they don\u2019t go after strong people.\u201d\n\nOn how Harvey Weinstein introduced her once: \u201cHe actually told the audience, \u2018If I had to get in a boxing ring with Muhammad Ali or Jessica Chastain, I would choose Muhammad Ali.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn her husband Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo: \u201cI never wanted to get married. When I first met my husband, he knew that marriage wasn\u2019t something I was interested in. And then as we got to know each other, the idea of marriage shifted for me. There are some things worth celebrating\ufffd\u201dand he\u2019s worth celebrating. I actually love being married. I never thought I would, but this is a spectacular human being, and I am celebrating that I get to share my life with him.\u201d\n\nFor more from Jessica, visit WSJ.com.", "images": ["http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chastain-wsj/thumbs/jessica-chastain-wsj-magazine-01.jpg", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/button_feed.gif", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chastain-wsj/thumbs/jessica-chastain-wsj-magazine-03.jpg", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/img/slides/button_reverse.gif", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/justjared_circlelogo_2.gif", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2018/01/chastain-wsj.jpg", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/khloe-kardashian-date.jpg", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/one-world-top.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=31732370&c3=874156489745619&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/button_facebook.gif", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chastain-wsj/thumbs/jessica-chastain-wsj-magazine-02.jpg", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/tmz_footer.gif", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/aubrey-plaza-jeff-baena-walk-their-dogs-rare-outing.jpg", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/billie-eilish-sunny-one-world-special.jpg", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/jr-circle-logo.gif", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/jj-circle-logo.gif", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chastain-wsj/thumbs/jessica-chastain-wsj-magazine-04.jpg", "http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/zac-links-hsm.jpg", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/button_twitter.gif", "http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/button_instagram.gif", "http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/celebitchy_footer2.gif", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/sidebar/jjjr_logo_featured.gif", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/jjlogo4.gif", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-2bXhGE9g7fCno.gif", "http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2018/01/jessica-chastain-wsj-magazine.jpg", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-what-a-wonderful-world.jpg", "http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/button_jjj.gif", "http://cdn02.cdn.justjaredjr.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/taylor-swift-one-world-video.jpg", "http://cdn03.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix-show-photos.jpg", "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/img/slides/button_play.gif", "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/themes/default/images/toofab_footer2.gif"], "top_img": "http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2018/01/chastain-wsj.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.justjared.com/2018/01/17/jessica-chastain-recalls-the-moment-her-mothers-boyfriend-slapped-her-i-just-kicked-him-in-the-genitals/", "title": "Jessica Chastain Recalls the Moment Her Mother's Boyfriend Slapped Her: 'I Just Kicked Him in the Genitals'", "meta_data": {"description": "Jessica Chastain Recalls the Moment Her Mother\u2019s Boyfriend Slapped Her: \u2018I Just Kicked Him in the Genitals\u2019 Jessica Chastain is on the cover of WSJ.
