This is so stupid. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking about it, and I believe this shouldn\u2019t be turned out to be a race thing. I did my braids and I called them the Coco Swoop. I name all my styles that I do to myself. These are called the Coco Swoop. The braids before were called the Bo Derek Braids. And it\u2019s a Coco-ism. I've always done it. Why can\u2019t we all rename hairstyles or braids? That sounds so stupid. Why is everybody claiming something they shouldn\u2019t? I know braids have been around for thousands of years. Don\u2019t you think I know that? If I wanna wear a pineapple on my head, then I should be able to wear a pineapple on my head and call it the Pineapple Cocowop. I don\u2019t know. You see where I\u2019m going with this? Why is everybody hating?\"\n\n\n\n[ transcript ]\n\n\"People rename hairstyles all day long. Look Beyonce. Beyonce \u2013 she does this hairstyle, and now it\u2019s the Lemonade, but no one\u2019s gonna get mad at her, right? So, at the end of the day, this shouldn\u2019t be a race war. This should be a 'human thing,' right? Everybody should be able to do it. It\u2019s a 'human thing' \u2013 give that a shot \u2013 not a race war. It has nothing to do with race. But this just goes to show you that no one reads the captions underneath pictures. Otherwise, you would understand that this is not an issue. It\u2019s something that I do. It\u2019s a Coco-ism, okay? Now, to the love out there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I see it. I see all the comments. You know, power to you guys. I get this much love and that much hate, but sometimes, it\u2019s gotta come in and say something about it, because it\u2019s so disgusting. That we should be, like, loving each other, instead of hating on each other because of a hairstyle. Get over it.\"\n\n\n\nSince everybody is trying to make a big deal about my braids let me tell you how I feel....
