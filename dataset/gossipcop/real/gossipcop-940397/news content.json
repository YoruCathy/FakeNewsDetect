And you know what? We can do a scan of my face, darling,\" she told InStyle.\n\nHadid started modelling at the age of 16, and throughout her career has been accused of having several cosmetic procedures done, including a nose job and filler injections.\n\n\"I'm scared of putting fillers into my lips,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want to mess up my face.\"\n\nThe 2016 Model of the Year winner also opened up about her childhood insecurities from being bullied.\n\n\"I went through a serious depression last year,\" she said. \"I think it stemmed from when I was younger and [being bullied by] the kids in school.\"\n\nDespite her success in the fashion industry, Hadid still deals with cruel comments - now, though, they're on social media.\n\nOne comment on an Instagram photo of Hadid and Kendall Jenner called the pair \"fake bitches\" followed by a list of facial features they had supposedly had work done on.\n\nHadid replied: \"I wish you would only grasp a heart of your own. Blessings to you sweetheart. Jealousy is a cry for help.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old maintains that she's able to now rise above the criticism.\n\n\"I've learned that people are going to hate you and there's nothing you can do about it except be yourself and love yourself,\" she said.\n\nNewshub.", "images": ["https://www.newshub.co.nz/common/clientlibs/assets/newshub/imgs/other/newshub.seo.logo.png", "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/06/we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1527824742406/INSTAGRAM_BELLA-HADID_1120.jpg", "https://www.newshub.co.nz/common/clientlibs/assets/newshub/imgs/ui/logo-desktop.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/06/we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1527824742406/INSTAGRAM_BELLA-HADID_1120.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Newshub Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/06/we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours.html", "title": "'We can do a scan of my face, darling!' - Bella Hadid hits back at plastic surgery rumours", "meta_data": {"description": "She insists she's too scared of messing up her looks.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "uumI2OyeOotXTsQTpam2IRld56y7UffZn_SC9xkj8Jo", "hideAds": "false", "keyword": "models,fashion-entertainment,celebrity,fashion,plastic-surgery,entertainment", "adTargeting": "sect1=entertainment>sect2=we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours>tags=models,fashion-entertainment,celebrity,fashion,plastic-surgery,entertainment>article-content-type=pics>pagetype=content", "designPath": "/common/", "commonDesignPath": "/common/", "og": {"title": "'We can do a scan of my face, darling!' - Bella Hadid hits back at plastic surgery rumours", "description": "She insists she's too scared of messing up her looks.", "type": "article", "site_name": "Newshub", "url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/06/we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/06/we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1527824742406/INSTAGRAM_BELLA-HADID_1120.jpg", "type": "image/png", "width": 1120, "height": 640}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-01T15:49:22+12:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-01T15:48:59+12:00", "section": "Entertainment"}, "sitename": "newshub", "brandname": "newshub", "pageName": "entertainment:2018:06:'we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face,-darling!'---bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours-", "pageType": "content", "primaryContentType": "pics", "articleId": "we-can-do-a-scan-of-my-face-darling-bella-hadid-hits-back-at-plastic-surgery-rumours", "articleTitle": "'We can do a scan of my face, darling!' - Bella Hadid hits back at plastic surgery rumours", "articleCategory": "entertainment", "breadcrumb": "Entertainment>2018>06>'We can do a scan of my face, darling!' - Bella Hadid hits back at plastic surgery rumours", "endpoint": "Newshub Web", "mwEnableHeaderBidding": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewshubNZ", "title": "'We can do a scan of my face, darling!' - Bella Hadid hits back at plastic surgery rumours  | Newshub", "description": "She insists she's too scared of messing up her looks."}, "fb": {"pages": 314879818534}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527824962.0, "source": "https://www.newshub.co.nz", "summary": ""}
