After premiering her brand new video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Taylor Swift gave her backup dancers a present for keeping quiet about their role in the much-anticipated music video.\n\nSwift decided to premiere the video at the MTV VMAs, right after releasing a lyrical video that helped debut the song itself. The video was pretty complex \u2014 Swift is pretty much saying goodbye to her old personas and focusing on a rebrand. She already broke a record for having the most views a day after release \u2014 43.2 million views to be exact. And that number is, obviously, still climbing.\n\nAs we all know, success on projects like this happen when you\u2019ve got a solid team by your side. Which is why we\u2019re glad that Swift made sure to share her appreciation for those who helped out by sending flowers and a really sweet card.\n\nfalse\n\nThe card read, \u201cThanks for keeping our secret. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m so proud of it and I hope you will be too. Sending my love and gratitude, Taylor.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Swift has sent a bouquet to share her appreciation. She also sent flowers to those who stood by her during her recent trial. The employees at a company called Craftsy let Swift know that they were on her side by creating Post-It note messages on their windows, with motivational phrases like \u201cFree Tay,\u201d and song lyrics like \u201cPeople throw rocks at things that shine.\u201d\n\nThank you @taylorswift13! We're so happy our messages brightened your day as much as your flowers brightened ours! \ud83e\udd17 pic.twitter.com/Yd0QvdBXQh \u2014 Bluprint (@therealbluprint) August 15, 2017\n\nWe\u2019re all about the sweet gesture. It\u2019s good to know that Swift gives credit where credit\u2019s due.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F30000606%2Ftaylor-swift-music-video.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072550/avatar-i-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F30000606%2Ftaylor-swift-music-video.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dancers a special gift for \"keeping our secret\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "floral,hellogiggles,karen belz,music video,taylor swift", "news_keywords": "floral,hellogiggles,karen belz,music video,taylor swift", "description": "It's pretty sweet that Taylor Swift made sure to acknowledge her dancers for keeping her record-breaking video a secret.", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift gave her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dancers a special gift for \"keeping our secret\"", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "description": "This is super sweet.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F30000606%2Ftaylor-swift-music-video.jpg", "width": 532, "height": 999}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "description": "It's pretty sweet that Taylor Swift made sure to acknowledge her dancers for keeping her record-breaking video a secret.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F30000606%2Ftaylor-swift-music-video.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dancers a special gift for \"keeping our secret\"", "description": "This is super sweet.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F30000606%2Ftaylor-swift-music-video.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tmd-ClpJxA?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
