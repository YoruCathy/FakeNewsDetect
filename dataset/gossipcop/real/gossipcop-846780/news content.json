Yeah, the release date announcement video is less than 20 seconds and just scans an abandoned mess hall in the prison. But we\u2019re willing to overlook the lack of action now that we know when the sixth installment will drop.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since we saw the ladies of Litchfield and, based on the one line of dialogue we get in the clip, we can tell you we\u2019re entering a whole new world with them when they return. Well, at least that\u2019s what Piper (Taylor Schilling) says and based on where we left things last year, its safe to say the times are a changin\u2019.\n\nAlso Read: 'Orange Is the New Black' Star Laverne Cox Exclusive EmmyQuickie Portraits (Photos)\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t remember (since it\u2019s been a while) the final episode of season five played out over three days during a riot and saw Piper, Alex (Laura Prepon) and Nicky (Natasha Lyonne), holed up in Frieda\u2019s bunker that had just been turned over by CERT officers, while the rest of the penitentiary\u2019s inmates were loaded up on buses and shipped out to new prisons.\n\n\u201cOITNB\u201d is produced by Lionsgate and also stars Laverne Cox, Uzo Aduba, Danielle Brooks and Dascha Palanco.\n\nWatch the teaser below.\n\nAlso Read: 'Orange Is the New Black' Star Laverne Cox on Why Season 4 Was Unlike Any Other Season (Exclusive Video)\n\n\u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d Season 6 will drop on July 27 on Netflix.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laura-bush-michelle-obama-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/white-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bill-cosby-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/pirates1-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/WEB_LAVERNECOX-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-52741361-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WEB-Danielle-Brooks5-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dwayne-Johnson-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/orange-is-the-new-black-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/LaverneCix-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/oitnb.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/orange-is-the-new-black-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ashley Boucher", "Beatrice Verhoeven", "Sean Burch", "Daniel Goldblatt", "Rosemary Rossi", "Trey Williams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/orange-is-the-new-black-season-6-release-date-netflix-video/", "title": "Netflix Announces 'Orange Is the New Black' Season 6 Release Date", "meta_data": {"parsely-title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Season 6 Locks Up Netflix Release Date (Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/orange-is-the-new-black-season-6-release-date-netflix-video/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-06-05T08:00:33-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Ashley Boucher", "parsely-tags": "laura_prepon, netflix, oitnb, orange_is_the_new_black, taylor_schilling", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "\"Orange Is the New Black\" is back, and just in time to take your summer to the max.
