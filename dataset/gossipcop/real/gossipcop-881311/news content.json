Fortunately, since Stone was working out so much (twice a day), she was hungry enough to down the filling beverages.\n\nShe lifted an impressive amount of weight.\n\nSome of Walsh\u2019s daily go-to strength training exercises for Stone? Pushing and pulling sleds twice her size, heavy farmer\u2019s walks (aka walking while holding dumbbells) and up to 300-pound hip thrusts. At one point, Stone was deadlifting 185 pounds and doing push-ups with 50 pounds of chains on her back.\n\n\u201cI was pretty proud,\u201d Walsh says.\n\nThen she backed off.\n\nWhile Stone was gaining weight, she stayed away from fat-burning cardio. But once she achieved the right look for the film, \u201cwe started adding conditioning aspects,\u201d Walsh says. That meant Stone was lifting fewer weights and doing cardio at Rise Nation once or twice a week.\n\nShe's two years beyond her most intensive Battle of the Sexes training, but Walsh encourages the actress, and anyone else trying to stay in shape, to mix activities like yoga and hiking with strength training.\n\nYes, for women. And, yes, that means lifting weights.\n\n\u201cI train (GLOW star) Alison Brie and (future Captain Marvel) Brie Larson, and all of these girls are strong as hell and not big,\u201d he says. In fact, after incorporating weight-lifting into their workout routine, \u201cThey fit into their clothes better (and) are three, four, five times stronger than before.\u201d\n\nWant to see the results of Stone's hard work? Battle of the Sexes is in theaters now in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, San Francisco and Washington. It expands nationwide Friday.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5581391467001_5581386442001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6d852f006e615deaaf7f98e67ba1f39f67edfc2/c=0-327-3825-2488/local/-/media/2017/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636416127584685847-XXX-battle-of-the-sexes-dom-0BOTS-00253-rgb.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6d852f006e615deaaf7f98e67ba1f39f67edfc2/c=0-327-3825-2488/local/-/media/2017/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636416127584685847-XXX-battle-of-the-sexes-dom-0BOTS-00253-rgb.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/09/24/heres-how-emma-stone-gained-15-pounds-of-muscle-battle-sexes/691127001/", "title": "Here's how Emma Stone gained 15 pounds (of muscle) for 'Battle of the Sexes'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Here's how Emma Stone gained 15 pounds (of muscle) for 'Battle of the Sexes'", "description": "The 'La La Land' actress hoisted heavy weights and chugged high-calorie shakes to prep for playing tennis icon Billie Jean King.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/09/24/heres-how-emma-stone-gained-15-pounds-of-muscle-battle-sexes/691127001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6d852f006e615deaaf7f98e67ba1f39f67edfc2/c=0-327-3825-2488/local/-/media/2017/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636416127584685847-XXX-battle-of-the-sexes-dom-0BOTS-00253-rgb.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Carly Mallenbaum", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The 'La La Land' actress hoisted heavy weights and chugged high-calorie shakes to prep for playing tennis icon Billie Jean King.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6d852f006e615deaaf7f98e67ba1f39f67edfc2/c=0-327-3825-2488/local/-/media/2017/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636416127584685847-XXX-battle-of-the-sexes-dom-0BOTS-00253-rgb.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Here's how Emma Stone gained 15 pounds (of muscle) for 'Battle of the Sexes'", "description": "The 'La La Land' actress hoisted heavy weights and chugged high-calorie shakes to prep for playing tennis icon Billie Jean King."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506182400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
