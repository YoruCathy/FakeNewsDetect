The singer also attended the wedding earlier in Saturday in Windsor.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, John took the stage after Prince Harry, following his speech, asked his guests, \u201cDoes anyone here know how to play the piano?\u201d John then sat by the piano and performed four songs, \u201cYour Song,\u201d \u201cCircle of Life,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Still Standing\u201d and \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d; the latter song features the lyric \u201cL.A. lady,\u201d a nod to Markle\u2019s acting career.\n\nEllie Goulding similarly covered \u201cYour Song\u201d at the wedding of Harry\u2019s brother Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\n\u201cPrince Harry asked Sir Elton to perform at the Reception which was hosted by Her Majesty The Queen at St George\u2019s Hall, Windsor Castle,\u201d

extremely shy and sweet Prince Harry at a private lunch at Kensington Palace, given by his mother Princess Diana for Gianni Versace and me many years ago,\u201d John once said. \u201cWhat a joy it has been to see that young boy grow to inherit his mother\u2019s warmth, sense of humor and courage to stand up and champion the causes he truly believes in.\u201d\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Idris Elba were among the celebrities to attend the Royal Wedding.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY",
