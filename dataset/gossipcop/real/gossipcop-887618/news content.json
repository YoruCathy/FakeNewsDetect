In a recent interview with U.K. magazine Heat, Harington reportedly revealed that his now-fianc\u00e9e once made him dress up as his onscreen persona Jon Snow for a \u201cbad taste\u201d costume party.\n\n\u201cShe pulled out a Jon Snow costume, and Rose just whispered in my ear, \u2018I won\u2019t love you if you don\u2019t wear it,'\u201d he said.\n\nHarington went on to say that the prank had its desired effect, as he spent the evening feeling uncomfortable in the store-bought version of the King in the North\u2019s rugged garb. \u201cIt was really embarrassing,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe people bringing around canapes were looking at me, thinking, \u2018You\u2019re sad man! You\u2019ve come to a party dressed as your character.'\u201d\n\nThe story ties in well with the history of Harington and Leslie\u2019s relationship, as the two met \u2014 and fell in love \u2014 on the set of Thrones after Leslie was cast opposite Harington to play Wildling warrior Ygritte.\n\nGet The Brief.
