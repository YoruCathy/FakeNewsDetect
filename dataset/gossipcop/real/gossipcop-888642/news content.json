In a new interview with The Sunday Times, the 25-year-old singer opened up about embracing his sexuality and gender identity.\n\n\"I don't know what the title would be, but I feel just as much woman as I am man,\" he explained, talking about his love for dressing in heels (\u201cI love a heel. I\u2019ve got loads of heels at home.\u201d).\n\n\u201cThere was one moment in my life where I didn't own a piece of male clothing, really. I would wear full make-up every day in school, eyelashes, leggings with Dr. Martens and huge fur coats, for 2.5 years,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if he considers himself a cisgender male (meaning he associates with the sex he was assigned at birth), he showed two Venus symbols on his fingers.\n\nMORE: Sam Smith Announces 2018 Tour, 'The Thrill of It All' Album Release Date\n\n\"No. I mean, I've got these tattoos on my fingers,\u201d he explained.\n\nSmith also opened up about coming out as gay, saying, \u201cLooking back on it, it was the fear of saying the wrong thing and offending\u2026 And I was 19 when I started writing the first album. I\u2019d just moved to London from a village \u2014 I was literally the only gay in the village. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to say.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Smith stepped out with his new boyfriend, 13 Reasons Why star Brandon Flynn, in NYC, packing on the PDA.\n\nFor more on the new romance, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-10/sam_smith_gettyimages_860592298.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=I5DrXG4E", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sam_smith_gettyimages_860592298.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=EA1MmqD5", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/gettyimages-692085362.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=TnqSx9El"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sam_smith_gettyimages_860592298.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=EA1MmqD5", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/sam-smith-talks-sexuality-and-gender-identity-i-feel-just-much-woman-i-am-man-89687", "title": "Sam Smith Talks Sexuality and Gender Identity: \u2018I Feel Just as Much a Woman as I Am a Man\u2019", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Sam Smith Talks Sexuality and Gender Identity: \u2018I Feel Just as Much a Woman as I Am a Man\u2019 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sam-smith-talks-sexuality-and-gender-identity-i-feel-just-much-woman-i-am-man-89687", "title": "Sam Smith Talks Sexuality and Gender Identity: \u2018I Feel Just as Much a Woman as I Am a Man\u2019", "description": "He also opened up about coming out.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sam_smith_gettyimages_860592298.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=EA1MmqD5", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "He also opened up about coming out.", "title": "Sam Smith Talks Sexuality and Gender Identity: \u2018I Feel Just as Much a Woman as I Am a Man\u2019", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Rachel McRady\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sam-smith-talks-sexuality-and-gender-identity-i-feel-just-much-woman-i-am-man-89687", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sam_smith_gettyimages_860592298.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=EA1MmqD5"}, "description": "He also opened up about coming out.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Sam Smith", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
