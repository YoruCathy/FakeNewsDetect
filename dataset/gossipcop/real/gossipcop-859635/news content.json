We\u2019ve already oohed and ahhed at Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s ultraorganized pantry, but now we\u2019re ogling her playroom, which features the most beautiful rainbow color scheme.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress and Goop CEO enlisted Nashville-based organization service The Home Edit to help her get her Hamptons home in order.\n\nthehomeedit/Instagram/NBC\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nThey were the ones who did the now-famous pantry, and recently shared snaps of the gorgeous playroom.\n\n\u201cWe just spent the most INCREDIBLE few days at @gwynethpaltrow's Hamptons house,\u201d they posted on Instagram. \u201cOur favorite project from the trip (and of all time) was the playroom.\u201d\n\nThe room features two walls of bookshelves with activities (like board games and a globe) on the left and leisure (like books and plush animals) on the right. To organize it even more, they created zones for reading, games, art, crafts and science.\n\n\u201cWe categorized books and stuffed animals by color so that everything is easy to find (not to mention pretty to look at),\u201d they added. The result is a beautiful crisp white room with strategically placed pops of color. We just wonder how long the meticulous organization will actually last once a kid gets into it.\n\nPaltrow\u2019s children, Apple and Moses, are 13 and 11 respectively, so perhaps they\u2019ll be a little more tidy than, say, a toddler might be.\n\nFeeling inspired to make your own playroom this gorgeous? You can find the products and custom labels on The Home Edit\u2019s website.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201706/tdy_pop_lauer_gwyneth_170615.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_09/1221900/gwyneth-paltrow-today-tease-001-170615_5a98e4690c08a345ef7da95f216e922f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_09/1221900/gwyneth-paltrow-today-tease-001-170615_5a98e4690c08a345ef7da95f216e922f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/home/gwyneth-paltrow-s-hamptons-house-playroom-so-organized-t112824", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow has the most organized playroom we've ever seen", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/home/gwyneth-paltrow-s-hamptons-house-playroom-so-organized-t112824", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow has the most organized playroom we\u2019ve ever seen", "description": "Talk about organization goals!
