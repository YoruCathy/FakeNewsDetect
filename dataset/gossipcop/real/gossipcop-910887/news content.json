It's not like 'it's rape, or it's fine.'\n\n\"I think some of us have gotten so used to the behaviour of a guy being kind of like 'come on' - at a younger age, especially.\n\n\"In college I feel like that was a quarter of my hook-ups - they see what they can get out of you.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAmy said many wouldn't want to see Aziz lose his career, \"but that's where people's minds go\".\n\n\"They go 'does he deserve this'? And it's really not about that. I think it's about expressing and showing women that that behaviour's not okay and that not only can you leave, you need to leave.\"\n\nSchumer said Aziz's alleged behaviour was \"not a crime, but it's not cool and it can still really mess with a woman\".\n\n\"I identify with all the women in these situations,\" she says.\n\n\"Even if it's my friend I don't go 'oh but he's a good guy'. I think 'what would it feel like to have been her?'\"\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3A58/production/_99863941_compostite.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=newsbeat::news.newsbeat.story.42918057.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:78cd2a85-6f61-3c40-a300-2f73c63d5a19]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3A58/production/_99863941_compostite.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3A58/production/_99863941_compostite.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-42918057", "title": "Amy Schumer weighs in on Aziz Ansari allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The comedian says many young women will have experience of being pressured into sex.", "x-country": "hk", "x-audience": "Asia", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Asia", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 115412389, "og": {"title": "'It's not like it's rape or it's fine'", "type": "article", "description": "The comedian says many young women will have experience of being pressured into sex.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-42918057", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3A58/production/_99863941_compostite.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
