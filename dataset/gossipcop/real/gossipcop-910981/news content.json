{"url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/han-solo-movie-about/", "text": "Update From Editor Peter Sciretta: The following post was published on February 7th 2013 after we first learned that Disney was developing a Star Wars spin-off standalone film that would follow a young Han Solo, set between Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV: A New Hope. Now that it has been confirmed that a Star Wars Anthology film following a young Han Solo will be directed by Lego Movie directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller for a Summer 2018 release, I thought this might be worth republishing.\n\nWhat would a Han Solo standalone original movie be about?\n\nSifting through the backstory established in the original trilogy, the elaborate expanded universe in the books and games, witht he help of Wookieepedia, we have some good ideas of what we might expect from this standalone tale.\n\nHow Old Will Han Be?\n\nHarrison Ford was 33 years old when he started filming George Lucas\u2018 original Star Wars film, later subtitled A New Hope. The movie took place in 0 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin) and Lucasfilm has published Han Solo\u2019s birth year as 29 BBY (Before battle of Yavin). Solo was originally supposed to appear in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith as a ten-year old boy who helps Yoda find General Grievous\u2019 location. (Concept art from preproduction can be seen above). So this movie would take place somewhere between the age of 10 and the age of 35, a wide spread. Since this is an origin story, I think its pretty safe to assume Han will be in his late teens to early 20\u2019s (college-aged).\n\nWill the Movie Stick to Expanded Universe Histories?\n\nI think its pretty much assumed that the new movies will not stick to the expanded universe mythology created over the years in books, games and magazines. Lucas himself would borrow from the expanded universe, but write a completely different history in the prequels. The events in the movies have always been considered canon over the expanded universe history. But we can probably expect to see some key events to be borrowed from the expanded universe, and most notably from the \u201cHan Solo Trilogy\u201d of novels. (Includes Paradise Snare, The Hutt Gambit, and Rebel Dawn.)\n\nHow Han Solo and Chewbacca Meet\n\nIn the books, Han and Chewie first meet on an Empire slave ship while Lt. Solo is an Imperial pilot. Solo boards a derelict slaving craft to find that its cargo of Wookiee children had escaped, and a badly wounded Wookiee in the pilot\u2019s seat. Han is ordered to skin the helpless Chewbacca, but refuses. The duo escape punishment, with the assistance of the Rebel Alliance. Chewbacca had sworn a life debt to Han and wouldn\u2019t leave his side. Han was not happy to have Chewie around until the day Chewbacca saved Solo from a beating after being caught cheating. This event brought the duo became much closer.", "images": ["https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/ZZ5A5E2EC2-550x412.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/ZZ022E5270-550x343.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/HanJabbaDockingBay94-700x298.png", "https://www.slashfilm.com/siteimages/pm-comments.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/ZZ59D408F9-550x332.jpg", "https://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?1648144&101", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon_smuggling_compartment.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/authors/30.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/Falcon_smuggling_compartment.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sciretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/han-solo-movie-about/", "title": "10 Storylines To Expect From The Han Solo Star Wars Spin-Off Movie \u2013 /Film", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 254451208349115}, "news_keywords": "george-lucas, han solo, harrison-ford, star-wars, movies, film, tv", "original-source": "https://www.slashfilm.com/han-solo-movie-about/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "10 Storylines To Expect From The Han Solo Star Wars Spin-Off Movie \u2013 /Film", "description": "Update From Editor Peter Sciretta: The following post was published on February 7th 2013 after\u00a0we first learned that\u00a0Disney was\u00a0developing a\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0spin-off standalone film that would follow a young Han Solo, set between\u00a0Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\u00a0and\u00a0Episode IV: A New Hope.
