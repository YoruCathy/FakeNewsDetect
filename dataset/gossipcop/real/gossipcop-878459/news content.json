But they don\u2019t realize in 2015 in \u2018Bad Blood,\u2019 Taylor Swift was wearing a black crop top. I really do think, by the way, that Beyonc\u00e9 copied \u2018Bad Blood.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold statement from a man who\u2019s already felt the fire of the Lemonade singer\u2019s fans, but Kahn is no stranger to controversy when it comes to his collaborations with Swift.\n\nHe came to Swift\u2019s defense in a statement in 2015, explaining his creative vision with Swift after the \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d video was widely criticized for glamorizing African colonialism.\n\nGet The Brief.
