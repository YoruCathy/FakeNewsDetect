A little bit, if only when pitted against contemporary ethics. As the original, animated version of the film unspooled at the Hollywood Bowl Friday night in a combination of screening and all-star live musical performance, it was clear that a few of the moral lessons imparted in 1991 seem slightly out of step with the mores of 2018.\n\nThe concept of captivity as a breeding ground for romance seems ripe for a #BelleToo response. And however eagerly we await the beast\u2019s screen redemption, surely all the psychological think-pieces of the last few years have disabused us of believing clinical narcissism is even remotely a curable condition. As for the idea that the west wing is the most treacherous place a person could venture\u2026 well, okay, that one still holds.\n\nBut the songwriting team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken could sell us on anything, and after their \u201cyou\u2019ll believe a plant can jive\u201d introduction with \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d and revivification of an entire artform with \u201cLittle Mermaid,\u201d they went so big with \u201cBeauty\u201d that it still stands as just about anyone\u2019s conception of what an animated song score should be. It got the adoring tribute it deserved Friday in the first of two Bowl shows that had Zooey Deschanel, Taye Diggs, Rebel Wilson, Kelsey Grammer and Jane Krakowski giving flesh to the toons, and tunes, between 2D dialogue-and-action scenes that had a full orchestra working full-time.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything that\u2019s not going to date in the slightest, it\u2019s Ashman/Menken\u2019s take on love in first bloom, fairy-tale or otherwise \u2014 best summed up in a couple of ridiculously simple but classic lines: \u201cThere may be something there that wasn\u2019t there before\u201d and, of course, \u201cNew, and a bit alarming,\u201d a lyric that can apply about equally to interspecies dating or, really, any first crush.\n\nLiving up to her PG-13 reputation, Wilson introduced a previously unheard bit of dialogue to the song \u201cGaston\u201d that may or may not have been scripted for the occasion. Cross-dressing in a suit and poufy brunette wig as Gaston\u2019s foppish sidekick, LeFou (who was still ambiguously gay at most in the 2017 live-action movie remake), Wilson explained why Belle would surely have to chill with the villain, asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s her other option, bestiality?\u201d It\u2019d be interesting to learn whether Disney signed off on that ad lib \u2014 but finally, in an official version, someone has addressed the hairy elephant in the room.\n\nWilson counts as enjoyable stunt casting, if no one was about to rate her vocal chops against anyone else\u2019s on the stage. The producers had enough faith that these two would be the ones a Bowl audience would most want to see up-close that they gave them a separate perch halfway up in the audience, so that they could perform their parts of the final big number, \u201cThe Mob Song,\u201d apart from the rest of the rabble to the back of the Bowl. There\u2019s been some LeFou/Gaston fan fiction, so let\u2019s see if we get any Rebel Wilson/Taye Diggs fanfic out of this production.\n\nMost of the rest of the casting was more on the nose. For Lumiere, you could hardly find anyone who combines buttoned-up and boisterous \u2014 and with an agreeably haughty accent \u2014 better than Grammer. Krakowski makes for a slightly slinkier Mrs. Potts than Angela Lansbury might have had us imagining, but she resisted any temptation to go all \u201cNine\u201d on us in the role, only running her hands down the sides of her white dress once. Ending her rendition of the title song with the number\u2019s traditional spoken-word asides to young Chip, Krakowski\u2019s British accent was endearingly maternal enough that you wished the show could find a way to have the actors do all the dialogue as well as singing, technically challenging as that synch might be.\n\nMichael Buckner/Variety\n\nAs Belle, Deschanel did not have as big a stage presence or booming a voice as Sara Bareilles did when she played Ariel in a similar Bowl production of \u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d two summers ago, but wide-eyed winsomeness goes a long way when the part is as small as this one actually is. When Deschanel stepped out onto the semicircular wall that separates the Bowl\u2019s \u201cpool circle\u201d seats from the garden boxes to sing \u201cBelle (Reprise)\u201d not too long into the first act, anyone who knows the score knew this was practically a curtain call for the leading lady, since the character only participates in one other song later on.\n\nMichael Buckner/Variety\n\nBut that\u2019s one of several peculiarities that you don\u2019t really think about when you\u2019re watching the Disney movie, but have to think about when transferred to a live medium. (This was the case with \u201cLittle Mermaid,\u201d too, where the heroine also gets a big, introductory quest number and not much else to sing.) Inherent limitations to the original film that a stage producer has to deal with: There are just six songs in the whole movie (not counting reprises); the Beast only sings four lines in the film; there\u2019s no 11:00 number, etc.\n\nDirector Richard Kraft has made a lot of canny calls. A film-scoring agent turned director, he brings a deep knowledge and love of Disneyana to some of the tiny staging touches as well as major creative decisions. He made especially great choices in bringing additional songs to incorporate to flesh out the show from its cinematic origins.\n\nNeither of the two added numbers was as musically strong as the six original Ashman/Menken film tunes, but both were nonetheless standouts, for different reasons. An unbilled Marissa Jaret Winokur, of Tony-winning \u201cHairspray\u201d fame, appeared after intermission to play the castle\u2019s warbling wardrobe in \u201cHuman Again,\u201d a song that was cut from the \u201991 film during production but fully animated and added for the 2002 DVD (as well as the Broadway version). And while the previously heard version was more of an ensemble number, Kraft went back and found some unused lyrics from Menken\u2019s original 11-verse draft to make it an essentially solo showcase for one particular piece of furniture. Winokur, in her best diva mode, had a great introduction for the number: \u201cI never dreamed my return to the Hollywood Bowl would be as wardrobe!\u201d\n\nThe other added number had an even more unexpected payoff. \u201cEvermore\u201d was written by Menken and Tim Rice for last year\u2019s live-action movie remake, as a big ballad that would give the beast an entire tune to sing. The fact that it didn\u2019t get a best song Oscar nomination belied the belief of many viewers felt it came off as filler in the film. But something transformative happened in handing this song over to the least known member of the Bowl cast, Anthony Evans, an African-American singer alternately known for being a \u201cVoice\u201d contestant and a handful of Christian records. However much the song didn\u2019t quite come off on screen being sung by an animated mongrel with an angry baritone, it very much worked sung in a higher register by a powerhouse belter whose emotions weren\u2019t masked behind computer generated whiskers. Least of billing, Evans was the star of the night as far as much of the audience was concerned, and the kind of surprise happy ending you hope for in a production where other climaxes are preordained. Menken had to feel pleased, if not vindicated, for \u201cEvermore\u2019s\u201d own happily-ever-after.\n\nIn lieu of anyone trying to fill in for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson for a duet version at the close, Menken himself came out to perform the song on piano, as a sweetly understated climax. That was the last of several pleasing guest spots that took place outside the context of the screening itself, including an introductory medley by D-Cappella, a flashy violin-and-cello pairing by Sandy Cameron and Tina Guo to come out of intermission, and best of all, a performance of \u201cFlight of the Bumblebee\u201d by 16-year-old pianist Emily Bear to accompany the showing of a 1948 Disney short, \u201cBumble Boogie.\u201d\n\nOther winning touches included themed lighting of the interior of the Bowl shell \u2014 when the beast lit a fire, the dome flickered pink and red \u2014 and semi-animated projections onto the entire proscenium that smartly but unobtrusively made the screening feel like more of a widescreen experience. Kraft\u2019s Disney love reached peak status when he brought out an actual whistler (Stephen Van Dorn, who played Cogsworth) to recreate the sound of Mickey\u2019s cheerful blowing during the bit of \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d that accompanies the Disney Animation Studios title card \u2014 the most delightfully silly moment in a silly-symphony kind of night.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Fbeauty-and-the-beast-hollywood-bowl-review-1202823389%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202823389&comment_count=5", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/taye-diggs-rebel-wilson.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/taye-diggs-rebel-wilson.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Willman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/beauty-and-the-beast-hollywood-bowl-review-1202823389/", "title": "Concert Review: \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 Gets Adoring Tribute at Hollywood Bowl", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "From Zooey Deschanel to Rebel Wilson, a Hollywood Bowl production of \"Beauty and the Beast\" made the most of star turns and stunt casting.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202823389, "author": "Chris Willman", "pmc-category": "Concert Reviews,News,Reviews", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-05-26T18:24:46"}, "pmc-tag": "Alan Menken,Beauty And The Beast,Hollywood Bowl,Jane Krakowski,Kelsey Grammer,Rebel Wilson,Taye Diggs,Zooey Deschanel", "title": "Concert Review: \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 Gets Adoring Tribute at Hollywood Bowl", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film,music", "pmc-primary-category": "Concert Reviews", "pmc-primary-vertical": "music", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Concert Review: \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 Gets Adoring Tribute at Hollywood Bowl", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/beauty-and-the-beast-hollywood-bowl-review-1202823389/", "description": "Is \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d dated?
