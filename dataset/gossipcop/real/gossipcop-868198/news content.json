The group is composed of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson; former member Zayn Malik departed from the group in 2015. The group signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to global success by social media,[1][2][3] One Direction's five albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Live While We're Young\", \"Best Song Ever\", \"Story of My Life\" and \"Drag Me Down\".\n\nThe group have won nearly 200 awards including seven Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, seven American Music Awards (including Artist of the Year in 2014 and 2015), and 28 Teen Choice Awards. They have embarked on four world tours, two of which were all-stadium. In 2013, they earned an estimated $75 million, becoming the second highest earning celebrity under 30 according to Forbes.[4] The world\u2019s best-selling artist of 2013, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) named them the Global Recording Artist of the Year.[5] Forbes ranked them as the fourth highest-earning celebrities in the world in 2015,[6] and second in 2016.[7]\n\nAfter the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the U.S. Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one.[8] Their third album, Midnight Memories, was the best-selling album worldwide in 2013 with 4 million copies sold globally.[9] The band's Where We Are Tour, in support of Midnight Memories, was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, the highest-grossing tour by a vocal group in history, and the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time, grossing $290.2 million (unadjusted for inflation).[10] In 2014, Billboard named One Direction Artist of the Year.[11][12] The band went on hiatus in January 2016, allowing all members to pursue other projects.[13][14] As of 2020, the band has sold a total of 50 million records worldwide.[15]\n\nHistory\n\n2010\u20132011: The X Factor\n\nThe X Factor Live tour in 2011 One Direction onLive tour in 2011\n\nIn 2010, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo candidates for the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor.[16] They all failed to progress in the \"Boys\" category at the bootcamp stage of the competition, but were instead put together to form a five-piece boy band,[17] thus qualifying for the \"Groups\" category. Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge,[16][18][19] and Simon Cowell have both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming the band. In 2013, Cowell said that it \"took him 10 minutes to put them together as a group\".[20] Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice.[21][22] Styles came up with the name One Direction.[21] For their qualifying song at \"judges' houses\", and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"Torn\".[23] Cowell later commented that their performance convinced him that they \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\"[24] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were his final act in the competition. The group quickly gained popularity in the UK.[24]\n\nOne Direction achieved third place in the competition and immediately after the final, their song \"Forever Young\", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet.[25] Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million Syco Records record contract.[26] Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne, a record producer.[27] A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was published by HarperCollins in February 2011,[28] subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list.[29] The same month, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK.[30] After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album.[27] Recording took place in Stockholm, London and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, and Rami Yacoub, among others.[31][32]\n\n2011\u20132012: Up All Night\n\nReleased in September 2011, One Direction's debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful\", was a commercial and international success. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, after becoming the most pre-ordered Sony Music Entertainment single in history.[33][34] Subsequent singles, \"Gotta Be You\" and \"One Thing\", peaked in the UK Singles Chart top ten.[35][36] In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America.[37] Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign One Direction; \"I just thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize and hold it.\"[38] That same month, they released Up All Night, their debut studio album, in the UK and Ireland. Critically commended for its appeal to the teenage audience,[39][40][41] it became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011.[42] In December 2011, they embarked on their first headlining UK concert tour, the Up All Night Tour.[43] Originally, the tour was set to end in January 2012.\n\nUpon One Direction's arrival in the US in February 2012, the group embarked on a radio promotion spree, as well as their first North American concert tour as an opening act for Big Time Rush, opening 16 shows after they had completed the first leg of the Up All Night Tour.[44][45] That month, they announced that an Oceania leg had been added to the tour.[46] They made their first US television appearance on The Today Show, at the Rockefeller Center; an estimated 15,000 fans descended on the plaza.[47] \"What Makes You Beautiful\" was officially released in the United States that same month,[48] where it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 28, becoming the highest debut for a British act since 1998.[49] On the US Billboard Hot 100, it reached as high as number four. As of June 2016, it has sold 4.8 million copies in the US[50] and over 7 million copes worldwide.[51] Up All Night was released internationally in March, and One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the US,[52] and were inducted into the Guinness World Records as a result.[53] After the album's international release, it topped the charts in sixteen countries.[54] Up All Night also became the first album by a boy band to sell 500,000 digital copies in the US and, by August 2012, had sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[55][56] It was the third global best-selling album of the year, selling 4.5 million copies.[57] Following the success of the album, a North American leg of the tour was announced later that month.[58]\n\nThe Up All Night Tour, comprising 62 shows, was met with positivity both critically and commercially, with critics praising their singing abilities and stage presence, and with tickets selling out in minutes.[59][60][61][62][63][64][65] A recording of a concert from the tour, Up All Night: The Live Tour, was released in May 2012.[66] In addition to the DVD topping the charts in twenty-five countries, its global sales had exceeded 1 million copies by August 2012.[56][67] One Direction's first book to be licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, published in the US in May 2012, topped The New York Times Best Seller list.[68] In June 2012, Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Music Entertainment UK, stated how he expects One Direction to represent a $100 million business empire over 2013.[69] Gatfield stated, \"What you might not know about One Direction is that they already represent a $50 million business and that's a figure we expect to double next year\".[69] In August 2012, the group's record sales exceeded 8 million singles, 3 million albums, and 1 million DVDs, and they performed \"What Makes You Beautiful\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London, which represented the handover to Rio de Janeiro as the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[56][70] One Direction were the biggest winners of the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards winning their three nominations on 6 September 2012, including Best New Artist.[71]\n\nIn April 2012, an American band that went by the same name filed a trademark infringement lawsuit.[72] According to the lawsuit, the US band had been using the name since 2009, recorded two albums and filed an application to register the trademark name in the US in February 2011.[72] The US band said they were entitled to three times the profits made by the UK band, as well as compensatory damages in excess of US$1 million.[72] The lawsuit claimed that Syco and Sony Music \"chose to ignore the plaintiff's rights and wilfully infringed them\" after they realised in early 2011 that the two bands shared the same name.[72] Syco Records subsequently counter-sued, suggesting the US group was trying to make money from One Direction's success and that the boy band was the first to use the name in US interstate commerce.[73] The BBC reported in September 2012 that the UK group won the legal dispute over the right to keep using their band name; the US band changed its name to Uncharted Shores.[73] The change of name was announced in a joint statement that also noted both groups were happy with the outcome.[73]\n\n2012\u20132013: Take Me Home\n\nIn September 2012, \"Live While We're Young\", the lead single from the group's second album, was released, and was a global success. It reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US.[74] A second single, \"Little Things\", resulted in the band's second number one single in the UK.[75] In November 2012, One Direction's second studio album, Take Me Home, was released.[76] It was an international hit, reaching number one in over 35 countries. Upon reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the group became the first boy band in US chart history to record two number-one albums in the same calendar year alongside becoming the first group since 2008 to record two number-one albums in the same year.[77] One Direction became the first group ever to have their first two albums reach atop the Billboard 200.[78] Take Me Home sold 540,000 copies in its first week in the US, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and topped the charts in more than thirty-four other countries.[79][80] Additionally, Up All Night and Take Me Home were the number three and number four best-selling albums of 2012 globally, each album selling over 4.4 million units worldwide.[81] The album and \"Little Things\" both debuted at number one in the UK simultaneously, making One Direction the youngest act in British chart history to achieve that.[82]\n\nTake Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits \"What Makes You Beautiful\" and \"One Thing\", spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around their tones.[83] One Direction began recording the album in May 2012, in Stockholm at Kinglet Studios.[84][85][86] The album cover artwork features the group surrounding a traditional British K2 red telephone box, a familiar sight on the streets of the UK.[87] Take Me Home garnered mixed reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while it was criticised for its generic, rushed nature.[88][89][90][91][92][93]\n\nOne Direction performed \"Little Things\" at the 2012 Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, and headlined a sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden on 3 December 2012.[94][95] In February 2013, One Direction released a cover version of \"One Way or Another\" and \"Teenage Kicks\", \"One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)\", as the 2013 Comic Relief single.[96] As part of their involvement with the UK charity, One Direction travelled to Ghana to volunteer at a children's hospital, visit a school and make donations.\n\nFollowing the release of Take Me Home, One Direction embarked on their second concert tour in February 2013, the Take Me Home Tour.[97] The concert tour consisted of 123 shows in Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania.

On 13 December, One Direction performed on The X Factor final. Their last televised performance as a group, before their hiatus, was on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on 31 December 2015.[148]\n\nOn 13 January 2016, Us Weekly published a report claiming that the group's hiatus would become a permanent split, with a \"source\" citing that each of the four remaining group members did not renew their contracts following the completion of the On The Road Again Tour in October 2015.[149] Representatives for the group denied said-report in a statement to Billboard, stating, \"nothing has changed regarding hiatus plans for the group, and all will be revealed in due time from the band members' own mouths.\"[150][151] By May 2017, all members of the group had released solo singles.[152] Despite saying the hiatus would last 18 months, the band still are yet to confirm when they will reform.\n\nAt the 2017 Brit Awards, One Direction won the Video of the Year award for their song \"History\". Payne accepted the award on the behalf of the band.[153] In February 2018, it was reported that the group has folded its touring company after having applied for removal within the Companies House registry in October 2017.[154][155]\n\nArtistry\n\nOne Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), is predominantly a pop music record, containing elements of teen pop, dance-pop, pop rock, with electropop and rock influences.[160][161][162][163] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey described the album as a \"collection of PG pop rock with killer choruses\",[164] while The New York Times considered it \"full of easy rock-inflected pop, blithe and sometimes clever.\"[165] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was \"necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement\".[163] The songs \"One Thing\" and \"What Makes You Beautiful\" were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock, for their \"powerhouse\" guitar riffs and \"forceful\" choruses.[156][157][160][166]\n\nTheir second studio album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune.[91][92][93][167][168] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian interpreted its signature sound as a \"peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars,\" which, he said, is at least an improvement on the substitute contemporary R&B \"that was once the grim lot of the boyband.\"[92] Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album \"far more mechanical\" than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar.[91] The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.[91][92][93][169]\n\nErica Futterman for Rolling Stone favoured their live acoustic performances as both showing, \"Horan's ability to play guitar, as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals. There was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show.\"[170] Herald Sun's Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have \"strong pop voices\".[171] Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, \"It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere in the midst of all the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain.\"[172] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: \"What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert.\"[173] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: \"As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out.\"[174] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's \"surprisingly accomplished effort\" of Kings of Leon's \"Use Somebody\" proved that One Direction are \"more than capable\" of evolving their sound.[175]\n\nTheir third album Midnight Memories (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound. Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a \"slightly rockier and edgier\" album than their previous material. The album is heavily influenced by 80's rock[176] and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in \"Little White Lies\". The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.[177]\n\nTheir fourth album Four (2014) was released on 17 November 2014. Payne once again claimed that the album would be \"edgier\" and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan came up with the name of the album, commemorating the fact that it is One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation. Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, \"Steal My Girl\", was dubbed by Billboard as \"no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction\",[178] and that the band was \"not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days\". Rolling Stone described the record as \"saturated with retro vibes\"; its songs \"split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours \u2013 a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit \"Days Are Gone\" did last year.\"[179]\n\nOther ventures\n\nEndorsements\n\nIn 2011, One Direction became the face of Pokemon Black and White, starring in a series of television adverts.[180] They were the first installments in the fifth generation of the Pok\u00e9mon series of role-playing games.[181] They also launched Nokia C3 and Nokia C2-02 phones.

A prominent annual event in British television, the group said it was \"incredible\" to be involved in Children in Need as it was something that they had \"always watched as children\".[204]\n\nIn February 2013, One Direction released \"One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)\" (a medley of \"One Way or Another\" and \"Teenage Kicks\") as the 2013 single for the UK's other major charity telethon Comic Relief.[96] For ITV's Santa charity Christmas campaign, they filmed a set of pleas to their fans and the general public, asking them to donate \u00a32.[205] The band have made numerous other appearances for charitable causes, including the 2011 Pride of Britain Awards where they presented 13-year-old quadruple amputee Danielle Bailey the Child of Courage award at her school assembly, and the 2014 Royal Variety Performance where they played in front of Prince William and Catherine at the London Palladium.[206][207]\n\nIn September 2012, Niall Horan organised an event to raise money for Irish Autism Action and another charity, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Mullingar, based in his hometown. Due to overwhelming demand to participate in the fundraising, the ticket website for the event broke down. Horan's brother Greg commented on the website crash, saying that \"there were 500 tickets and they were all snapped up pretty quick\".[208]\n\nIn 2013, band members Liam Payne and Harry Styles partnered with Trekstock, a leading cancer charity to help raise money for cancer research.[209] As ambassadors of the charity, the duo collaborated to offer the chance for one fan and a friend to win an evening out with them in return for a donation to the charity as part of an exclusive \"#HangwithLiam&Harry\" global campaign. They had originally set a goal of raising $500,000 and ended up raising $784,984. Trekstock later added that this amount would allow them to \"complete funding of their Hodgkin's lymphoma trial, in the hope of offering a much brighter future to thousands of children and young people affected by this form of disease.\" One Direction were named the most charitable in 2013 behind Taylor Swift by social change organisation DoSomething.org.[210] On 30 May 2013, the band announced a partnership with Office Depot on a limited-edition capsule collection of back to school supplies. They also confirmed that a portion of the proceeds from the alliance would go toward an anti-bullying educational program intended to promote kinder behaviour in schools.[211]\n\nIn 2014, One Direction donated \u00a3600,000 for the Stand up to Cancer campaign by giving portions of their ticket sales revenues from their Where We Are Tour.[212] On 15 November 2014, One Direction joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.[213]\n\nIn 2015, One Direction launched 'Action 1D' campaign to raise awareness of global issues. The initiative aims to end extreme poverty, tackle inequality and slow down climate change with the help of their millions of fans. It is part of the wider action/2015 campaign, a global citizen's movement that is all about the idea that 2015 can be the year when the world can set the agenda to end major global issues. One Direction will be asking their fans to describe the kind of world they want to live in by sharing powerful pieces of creative content, including videos and photos, using the hashtag #Action1D.[214] The quartet also starred in a campaign video, appealing to fans to join the movement.[215]\n\nImage\n\nOne Direction greet Swedish fans in Stockholm , May 2012\n\nNeil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, in an article on One Direction's success in North America, notes that Americans had left a gap in the market and it took the prominence of Justin Bieber to demonstrate that there still was a market for \"clean cut, wholesome, whiter-than-white, middle class parent friendly pop: cute boys advocating puppy love. And what could be better than one cute boy, if not five?\"[216] One Direction have been described as sparking a resurgence in the interest in boy bands, and as forming part of a new \"British Invasion\" in the United States.[217][218][219][220][221] Bill Werde, a representative of Billboard magazine, commented, \"There's a lot of possibility here, there's a lot of upside, that level of talent with those kinds of looks, it's really a perfect storm for a massive, massive successful phenomenon.\"[222] In NPR, Maria Sherman noticed that before One Direction's breakthrough, boy bands were \"off the radar\" since NSYNC went on an indefinite hiatus in 2002.[223]\n\nSonny Takhar, the chief executive officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. \"Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here \u2013 it's the act,\" he said. \"It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before.\"[222] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, \"These guys live online, and so do their fans.\"[221] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, \"which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans,\" according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian.[222] One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day.[224] In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is \"the cute one\", Malik is \"the quiet and mysterious one\", Payne is \"the sensible one\", Styles is \"the charming one\" and Tomlinson is \"the funny one\".[225] Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, \"At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather\u2014that whole stereotypical boy band thing.\" Instead, her original idea was for them to be the \"male equivalent to the Spice Girls\", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.[226]\n\nHoran commented on One Direction as a boy band, \"People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean.\"[227] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked they had succeeded on the latter front. \"For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys \u2013 posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows.\"[227] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, \"One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here\".[228]\n\nDiscography\n\nFilmography\n\nTours\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nOne Direction has received seven Brit Awards,[231] seven American Music Awards,[232] six Billboard Music Awards,[233] five Billboard Touring Awards, and four MTV Video Music Awards,[234] among other awards. One Direction holds the record as the most awarded act at the Teen Choice Awards with 28 wins from 31 nominations.[235]\n\nSee also\n\nPublications\n\nOne Direction: Forever Young , HarperCollins (17 February 2011) ISBN 978-0-00-743230-1\n\n, HarperCollins (17 February 2011) ISBN 978-0-00-743230-1 One Direction: The Official Annual 2012 , HarperCollins (1 September 2011) ISBN 978-0-00-743625-5\n\n, HarperCollins (1 September 2011) ISBN 978-0-00-743625-5 Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction , HarperCollins (15 September 2011) ISBN 978-0-00-744439-7\n\n, HarperCollins (15 September 2011) ISBN 978-0-00-744439-7 One Direction: Where We Are: Our Band, Our Story: 100% Official , HarperCollins (19 November 2013) ISBN 978-0-00-748900-8\n\n, HarperCollins (19 November 2013) ISBN 978-0-00-748900-8 One Direction: Who We Are: Our Official Autobiography, HarperCollins (25 September 2014) ISBN 978-0-00-757731-6", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/OnedirectionWWATchile.jpg/220px-OnedirectionWWATchile.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/One_Direction_X_Factor_Live_Glasgow.jpg/220px-One_Direction_X_Factor_Live_Glasgow.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/One_Direction_Sydney_6.jpg/220px-One_Direction_Sydney_6.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/One_Direction_2%2C_2013.jpg/220px-One_Direction_2%2C_2013.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/One_Direction_at_the_New_Jersey_concert_on_7.2.13_IMG_4238_%289206417991%29.jpg/220px-One_Direction_at_the_New_Jersey_concert_on_7.2.13_IMG_4238_%289206417991%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Chicago_IMG_9077_%2821423367939%29.jpg/220px-Chicago_IMG_9077_%2821423367939%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/19px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/1D_World%2C_Albion_Street%2C_Leeds_%2830th_March_2013%29_001.JPG/220px-1D_World%2C_Albion_Street%2C_Leeds_%2830th_March_2013%29_001.JPG", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/One_Direction_2015.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/One_Direction_2015.jpg/267px-One_Direction_2015.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/One_Direction_at_the_Logies_Awards_2012.jpg/220px-One_Direction_at_the_Logies_Awards_2012.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/One_Direction_2012_Stockholm.jpg/220px-One_Direction_2012_Stockholm.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/One_Direction_2015.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction", "title": "One Direction", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/One_Direction_2015.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
