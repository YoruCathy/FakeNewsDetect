We are not used to so many females being injured.\"\n\nShe added: \"We are used to seeing people who are stabbed.\n\n\"But to have six women who were stabbed, multiple times - it was just the amount of people - that was upsetting.\"\n\nMany of the staff who tended to patients after the London Bridge atrocity were also working on March 22 when Khalid Masood killed five people in an attack on Westminster Bridge.\n\nKate said: \"To go through this sort of event twice, it is quite unprecedented.\n\n\"What sort of training do you go through?\"\n\nShe also spoke to emergency consultant Malcolm Tunnicliff, who had been on his way home from playing cricket when he heard news of the incident and made his way to the hospital.\n\nHe said: \"We are very, very used to dealing with stabbings in this area.\n\n\"We are one of the busiest hospitals in western Europe for dealing with penetrating injuries, but it was the volume and it is usually young men that stab each other, and there were quite a lot of ladies who were stabbed.\n\n\"We got through a lot of kit in an hour and a half. Probably what we go through in a week.\"\n\nAsked what he took from the Duchess visiting, Dr Tunnicliff said: \"The dedication of all the staff, and actually how resilient they are and they are very proud to work for King's, and the NHS for that matter.\n\n\"It is nice when you have got someone like the Duchess of Cambridge who comes along. It was only four or five weeks ago Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall came along, and it gives the patients a lift, it gives the staff a lift that they're being recognised.\n\n\"And actually, all staff in the NHS want these days is just to be recognised for what they do, because they get knocked for so much.\n\n\"Someone like that coming along and recognising that, it is a massive lift.\"\n\nA series of tweets posted on the hospital\u2019s official account said: \u201cFollowing last week's London Bridge attack, we're pleased to welcome HRH The Duchess of Cambridge to King's today.\n\n\u201cHRH is meeting staff from our Emergency Department who were on shift during the London Bridge attacks.\n\n\u201cHRH is meeting staff on one of our trauma wards, as well as patients who are being treated at King's after being injured at London Bridge.\u201d\n\nIt was revealed on Friday by the Standard that every victim of the attack who made it to hospital has survived their injuries.\n\nTerrorists Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30 and Youssef Zaghba, 22, carried out the attack by ploughing into pedestrians with a rented van on London Bridge before stabbing dozens of people in Borough Market.", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/12/15/duchessofcampbridge.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/12/15/duchessofcampbridge.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hatty Collier"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/duchess-of-cambridge-makes-surprise-hospital-visit-to-meet-survivors-of-london-bridge-terror-attack-a3563201.html", "title": "Kate Middleton makes surprise visit to meet London Bridge terror attack victims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/duchess-of-cambridge-makes-surprise-hospital-visit-to-meet-survivors-of-london-bridge-terror-attack-a3563201.html", "title": "Kate makes surprise hospital visit to meet terror attack survivors", "description": "The Duchess of Cambridge paid a surprise visit to meet the victims of the London Bridge terror attack as they are recovering in hospital.\u00a0 Kate, 35, arrived at King\u2019s College Hospital in Denmark Hill, south-east London, shortly before 2pm on Monday.
