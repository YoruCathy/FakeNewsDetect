Melissa will have their son 70% of the time, and Jeremy will have him 30%. Both have waived spousal support. Melissa will keep the house and they both get to keep their vehicles.\n\nAs we previously reported, Jeremy's been ordered to pay $1,000 per month in child support. He also owes $12,000 to Melissa's attorney, Lisa Bloom.\n\nThe hits keep coming for Jeremy Meeks ... 9 days after his son with Chloe Green was born, he's hammered out his divorce from wife #1, Melissa.\n\nAccording to docs filed in L.A. County, Jeremy and Melissa are both officially single now. The judge signed off Wednesday, but sources connected to the exes tell us their division of assets -- child support and custody agreement (they have a 9-year-old son) -- is still up in the air.\n\nThe divorce news comes just as Jeremy, aka the \"Hot Felon,\" and Chloe announced the birth of their son, Jayden, by posting a pic of him gripping their fingers.", "images":
