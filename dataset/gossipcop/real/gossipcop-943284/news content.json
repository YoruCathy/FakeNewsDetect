But the truth is I\u2019ve tried and tried and tried to breast feed only and it wasn\u2019t working for me. I feel fortunate that I am able to still breast-feed but with the help of formula. Breast-feeding is something I really wanted to do. Just am not fully able \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) June 8, 2018\n\n\u2018Mummy shaming is real!
