Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres couldn\u2019t help but shed tears on the set of \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d Thursday when wife Portia de Rossi gave her a very special birthday present for her 60th birthday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,\u201d Portia told her. \u201cNot just now, but what you\u2019ve always cared about.\n\nDe Rossi played a video showing scenes from the life of Dian Fossey, one of Ellen\u2019s personal idols since she was a child. Fossey is well known for her work defending and documenting the mountain gorillas of Rwanda\u2019s Virunga Mountains.\n\nDeGeneres, who has worked for years to help rescue animals around the world, has said for the last two years that she wishes she could be doing more, de Rossi said. That was the inspiration for the gift that brought tears to her wife\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cSo for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building The Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,\u201d Portia said. \u201cEllen, you will carry on Dian\u2019s legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas.\n\nNot only that, Portia has also created The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund to help protect vulnerable species around the world.\n\n\u201cWhen we got married Portia\u2019s line was it\u2019s good to be loved, it\u2019s profound to be understood, and she understands me because that is the best gift anybody could have given me,\u201d Ellen said.\n\nI am proud, humbled, honored and deeply grateful to get to introduce you to my amazing new wildlife fund. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be loved. It\u2019s profound to be understood.\u201d Thank you, Portia. https://t.co/KzllU43mkI \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 2, 2018\n\n34.052234 -118.243685", "images": ["https://wreg.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/nexstar-logo-white-nmg.png", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/app-stores/googleplay_footer.png", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2019/10/gettyimages-926719206.jpg?w=705&h=495&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/04/Eugene-Jackson.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-9.10.40-PM.png?w=2560&h=1436&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/04/anti-social-distance-protest.png?w=1144&h=616&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-01-at-7-29-56-pm.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/03/McClendon.jpg?w=834&h=544&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/04/daycare-center.png?w=1093&h=580&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/social/instagram.png", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/02/WREG-web-logo-1.png", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/app-stores/appstore_footer.png", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2013/06/musselwhite.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/04/AP20109668164348.jpg?w=2560&h=1440&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/03/Coronavirus-3.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2019/07/gettyimages-482691137.jpg?w=724&h=483&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-01-at-7-29-56-pm.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tribune Media Wire", "Zachary Downes", "Jessica Gertler", "Jerrita Patterson"], "canonical_link": "https://wreg.com/news/ellen-degeneres-cries-after-receiving-the-best-birthday-gift-from-portia-de-rossi/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres cries after receiving the \u2018best birthday gift\u2019 from Portia de Rossi", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ellen couldn't help but cry on \"The Ellen Show\" Thursday when Portia de Rossi gave her a very special present for her 60th birthday.", "keywords": "Ellen DeGeneres, Viral Story, The Ellen Show, Portia de Rossi, The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,", "google-site-verification": "uJnF6Q7vJP3k7pEVLotNZ8dGfBwvCzC3at_F3MZ_CA4", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "geo.placename": "Los Angeles, CA, USA", "geo.position": "34.052234;-118.243685", "ICBM": "34.052234, -118.243685", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres cries after receiving the \u2018best birthday gift\u2019 from Portia de Rossi", "url": "https://wreg.com/news/ellen-degeneres-cries-after-receiving-the-best-birthday-gift-from-portia-de-rossi/", "description": "Ellen couldn\u2019t help but cry on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d Thursday when Portia de Rossi gave her a very special present for her 60th birthday.", "site_name": "WREG.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-01-at-7-29-56-pm.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-01-at-7-29-56-pm.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-02T14:49:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-02T14:49:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres cries after receiving the \u2018best birthday gift\u2019 from Portia de Rossi"}, "image": "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2018/02/screen-shot-2018-02-01-at-7-29-56-pm.png?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres cries after receiving the \u2018best birthday gift\u2019 from Portia de Rossi", "description": "Ellen couldn\u2019t help but cry on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d Thursday when Portia de Rossi gave her a very special present for her 60th birthday."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wreg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/01/favicon.png?w=16"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrTDwpLECtA?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1517500800.0, "source": "https://wreg.com", "summary": ""}
