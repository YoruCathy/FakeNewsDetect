Photo: Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage\n\nLast week, Michelle Williams revealed in a profile for Vanity Fair\u2019s September issue that she recently married musician Phil Elverum, of Mount Eerie, in a secret ceremony in the Adirondacks. And in an interview with Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald this weekend, Heath Ledger\u2019s father, Kim, said he and his family are \u201cterribly happy\u201d for Williams.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very private and I don\u2019t really like to make too many comments about her, but we are very happy [for her],\u201d Kim Ledger told the paper. He added that while he did not attend the couple\u2019s wedding in July, he was planning on visiting them in Brooklyn \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nWilliams and Ledger dated from 2005 to 2007, separating shortly before Ledger\u2019s death. They had a daughter together, Matilda, who\u2019s now 12. Like Williams, Elverum is also a single parent who lost his partner to tragedy. He has a daughter, Agathe, 3, whose mother, artist Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2015, just over a year after giving birth.\n\n\u201cUltimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole,\u201d Williams told Vanity Fair. \u201cI work to be free inside of the moment. I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/30/30-michelle-williams-heath-ledger.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/30/30-michelle-williams-heath-ledger.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/30/30-michelle-williams-heath-ledger.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeleine Aggeler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/heath-ledgers-dad-on-michelle-williams-new-marriage.html", "title": "Heath Ledger\u2019s Dad Says He\u2019s \u2018Terribly Happy\u2019 for Michelle Williams", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Heath Ledger\u2019s Dad Says He\u2019s \u2018Terribly Happy\u2019 for Michelle Williams", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/heath-ledgers-dad-on-michelle-williams-new-marriage.html", "description": "The actress married musician Phil Elverum in a secret ceremony this month.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/30/30-michelle-williams-heath-ledger.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Heath Ledger\u2019s Dad Is \u2018Terribly Happy\u2019 for Michelle Williams", "description": "The actress married musician Phil Elverum in a secret ceremony this month.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/30/30-michelle-williams-heath-ledger.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mmaggeler", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-30T12:04:16.505-04:00", "tag": "culture, celebrity, michelle williams, heath ledger, phil elverum, celebrity weddings", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Heath Ledger\u2019s dad, Kim, expressed his total support for Michelle Williams\u2019 new marriage to musician Phil Elverum.", "sailthru.tags": "culture, celebrity, michelle williams, heath ledger, phil elverum, celebrity weddings", "author": "Madeleine Aggeler", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532966656.505, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
