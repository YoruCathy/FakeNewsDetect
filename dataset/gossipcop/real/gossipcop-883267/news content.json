That's when Kim announces: \"We're having a baby!\"\n\nIn an April episode of KUWTK, Kim revealed she was pursuing surrogacy after she was told a third pregnancy was not in the cards: She suffered from placentaaccreta in her first pregnancy, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes giving birth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.\n\nMore:Reports: Kylie Jenner is pregnant\n\n\"I'm definitely leaning more towards I want to try ... After talking to Kanye, I think I always knew that surrogacy was an option, but I didn't think it was that realistic of an option, and now I feel like that's my reality. I feel like surrogacy really is the only other option for me,\" she said at the time.\n\nIn June, unnamed sources told People and E! Online the couple paid a surrogacy agency nearly $70,000 to find a surrogate, who will be paid about $45,000 for 10 months of carrying a pregnancy, with a bonus of $5,000 for each possible twin or triplet child.\n\nKardashian's half-sister, Kylie Jenner, 20, is also expecting her first child. According to People and TMZ, sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is pregnant, too.\n\nKardashian and Kanye West married in May 2014. They are parents to North, 4, and Saint, 20 months.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5593378243001_5593375490001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/09/28/kim-kardashian-finally-confirms-shes-expecting-third-child-kanye-west/713880001/", "title": "Kim Kardashian finally confirms she's expecting a third child with Kanye West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian finally confirms she's expecting a third child with Kanye West", "description": "She confirmed it in a trailer for her reality show, of course.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/09/28/kim-kardashian-finally-confirms-shes-expecting-third-child-kanye-west/713880001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1992, "height": 1126}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Andrea Mandell", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "She confirmed it in a trailer for her reality show, of course.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Kim Kardashian finally confirms she's expecting a third child with Kanye West", "description": "She confirmed it in a trailer for her reality show, of course."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506528000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
