The incident in question allegedly took place last year, after his show at the Cliffs Pavilion in Essex.\n\nThe woman accusing Nelly of misconduct claims she asked him to take a photo following his 5 December performance. She says the rapper gripped her tightly with his arm and brought her and her friends to his dressing room.\n\nOnce in the dressing room, the accuser claims Nelly escorted her into a separate room and began to masturbate in front of her. According to her account, Nelly also tried to take her top off and force her to perform oral sex. As she ran away, she claims he called her a \u201ccunt\u201d.\n\nThe investigation comes just months after the rapper, known chiefly for songs like Dilemma and Hot in Herre, was arrested in Washington state after being accused of rape by a 22-year-old student at the University of Washington named Monique Green. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr, denied the allegation while his lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, called the accusation \u201cscurrilous\u201d and \u201cmotivated by greed\u201d.\n\nThe criminal case against the rapper collapsed when prosecutors said they could not \u201cproceed or fully assess the merits of the case\u201d without the cooperation of the accuser, who wanted to stop the investigation. Soon after Nelly was sued for both sexual assault and defamation after his public denials. In a filing from January by Greene\u2019s legal team, two more women came forward with anonymous accusations of sexual assault against the rapper. The lawsuit alleges a \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d in which Nelly \u201cpreyed upon his selected female fans\u201d.\n\nThe incident in Essex, which occurred two months after the one in Seattle, is being looked into by local police. \u201cWe are investigating after a woman reported to us that she was sexually assaulted at an address in Station Road, Westcliff on December 5, 2017,\u201d the Essex police told tbe Guardian. \u201cEnquiries are ongoing.\u201d\n\nRosenblum, Nelly\u2019s attorney, gave a statement to TMZ about the investigation: \u201cThese allegations arose after Ms Green amended her suit for money to include a reference to these claims. The fact that the police are investigating these claims is not new information and Nelly welcomes a thorough investigation. Nelly is confident that once investigated, these claims will be determined to be disingenuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNelly was accompanied by his girlfriend during this tour and she was at his side throughout,\u201d Rosenblum added. \u201cIt is important that police investigate every allegation of this nature.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a849bd20315a5de313c0162ea7b7cbb7fb7d57ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f53062bd1940343c10acbc6c3781cc9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a849bd20315a5de313c0162ea7b7cbb7fb7d57ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=42c4fe60e30f1a2400143e8361a2e150", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rap,Music,Hip-hop,Sexual harassment,Rape and sexual assault,Culture"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a849bd20315a5de313c0162ea7b7cbb7fb7d57ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=42c4fe60e30f1a2400143e8361a2e150", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Nevins"], "canonical_link": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/14/nelly-under-criminal-investigation-for-sexual-assault", "title": "Rapper Nelly under criminal investigation for sexual assault", "meta_data": {"description": "Rapper%20Nelly%20under%20criminal%20investigation%20for%20sexual%20assault%20%7C%20Rap%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/14/nelly-under-criminal-investigation-for-sexual-assault", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a849bd20315a5de313c0162ea7b7cbb7fb7d57ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=42c4fe60e30f1a2400143e8361a2e150", "description": "The star, who was accused of rape late last year, is being investigated for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman after a concert in the UK", "type": "article", "title": "Rapper Nelly under criminal investigation for sexual assault", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jake-nevins", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-02-14T15:16:47.000Z", "tag": "Rap,Music,Hip-hop,Sexual harassment,Rape and sexual assault,Culture", "modified_time": "2018-04-11T15:56:19.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/feb/14/nelly-under-criminal-investigation-for-sexual-assault?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/feb/14/nelly-under-criminal-investigation-for-sexual-assault?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/14/nelly-under-criminal-investigation-for-sexual-assault", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/feb/14/nelly-under-criminal-investigation-for-sexual-assault?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a849bd20315a5de313c0162ea7b7cbb7fb7d57ab/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=43fa0789ad97bc11cb84a3e24cc1e228", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jhnevins"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518537600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
