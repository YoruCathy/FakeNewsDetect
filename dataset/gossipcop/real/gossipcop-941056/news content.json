Which is probably why a lot of image-conscious celebrities are hesitant to date the 40-year-old now.\n\nWhile they won\u2019t go out with him, Mayer said that A-listers will hang out with him \u2015 but only if his BFF Andy Cohen is around.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of friends who, without you, would want nothing to do with me and I find that exciting,\u201d Mayer said on an episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d that aired over the weekend. \u201cYou\u2019re friends with Jennifer Lawrence, who just, she doesn\u2019t wanna have anything to do with me. I don\u2019t have the greatest track record when it comes to celebrity relationships.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to watch your friends humor me on a friend level but also keep a fair distance from me,\u201d he said, as Cohen laughed. \u201cBecause if you are someone who cares about your image... dating John Mayer, at this point, is just conceptually sort of a no-no.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/VF via Getty Images John Mayer and Jennifer Aniston at the 2009 Vanity Fair Oscar party.\n\nThe star added one last self-deprecating jab: \u201cSo it\u2019s really fun to get to hang out with your A-list star friends who otherwise would be highly uncomfortable sitting around me.\u201d\n\nMayer has dated Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jennifer Aniston, Katy Perry and Renee Zellweger over the years.\n\nBut the singer famously revealed a little too much about his celebrity exes, speaking about his sex life with Simpson in a 2010 Playboy interview that will live in infamy.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris via Getty Images Mayer and Taylor Swift at a Vevo event on Dec. 8, 2009.\n\n\u201cSexually it was crazy,\u201d he said of his and Simpson\u2019s love life. \u201cIt was like napalm, sexual napalm. Did you ever say, \u2018I want to quit my life and just fucking snort you? If you charged me $10,000 to fuck you, I would start selling all my shit just to keep fucking you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, he spoke about dating Aniston, calling her the \u201cmost communicative, sweetest, kindest person.\u201d He also denied that the song \u201cHeartbreak Warfare\u201d is about her.\n\nTaylor Swift dated Mayer when she was just 19, and famously penned a song about him called \u201cDear John.\u201d It included lines like \u201cDon\u2019t you think 19 is too young to be played by your dark twisted games?\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home. I should\u2019ve known.\u201d\n\nMaybe he\u2019ll have better luck with Cohen as his wingman (and staying away from answering interview questions about his exes).\n\nKevin Mazur via Getty Images Mayer and Jessica Simpson were on and off for about two years.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1590792000004200b935c6.jpeg?ops=crop_14_7_1722_1953,scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1595982200004500eea780.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1596852000004200b935e0.jpeg?cache=kumnw8t3ua&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b15972f1a00002700ce08a8.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_2030_2460,scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5df70b30240000840a5a35d7.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1596852000004200b935e0.jpeg?cache=kumnw8t3ua&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-mayer-celebrities-wont-date-him_n_5b157e4fe4b010565aaeaa89", "title": "John Mayer Is Bummed That Jennifer Lawrence Won't Date Him", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"Dating John Mayer, at this point, is just conceptually sort of a no-no.\"", "keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence,Jennifer Aniston,Jessica Simpson ,John Mayer,Andy Cohen television personality,Jennifer Love Hewitt", "og": {"title": "John Mayer Explains Why Fellow Celebrities Don't Want To Date Him", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1596852000004200b935e0.jpeg?cache=kumnw8t3ua&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1596852000004200b935e0.jpeg?cache=kumnw8t3ua&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-mayer-celebrities-wont-date-him_n_5b157e4fe4b010565aaeaa89", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"Dating John Mayer, at this point, is just conceptually sort of a no-no.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Jennifer Lawrence,Jennifer Aniston,Jessica Simpson ,John Mayer,Andy Cohen television personality,Jennifer Love Hewitt", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-06-04 16:55:12 -0400", "modified_time": "2018-06-04 16:55:12 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "John Mayer Explains Why Fellow Celebrities Don't Want To Date Him", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b1596852000004200b935e0.jpeg?cache=kumnw8t3ua&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"Dating John Mayer, at this point, is just conceptually sort of a no-no.\"", "creator": "ledbettercarly"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b157e4fe4b010565aaeaa89", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528145712.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
