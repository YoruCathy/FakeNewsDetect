Olivia Munn has landed a new gig hosting the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018 amid reports that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick.\n\nThe X-Men: Apocalypse actress, 37, will lead the star-studded event on Thursday, January 11, at Barker Hanger in Santa Monica, California. \u201cWe are absolutely thrilled to have Olivia hosting this year\u2019s ceremony, and know that she will deliver an entertaining and sharp-witted evening to everyone in the room, and the viewers at home,\u201d Broadcast Film Critics Association president Joey Berlin said in a statement. \u201cBeyond her skills as an actress, Olivia\u2019s work as an activist within the industry gives her a powerful voice, making her the perfect candidate to lead this night honoring the best and brightest in film and television.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Munn was one of six women to allege sexual misconduct against director Brett Ratner in November 2017. The following month, she penned a candid essay for Entertainment Weekly about the \u201cabuse of power\u201d in Hollywood and expressed her staunch support for the \u201c#MeToo\u201d movement.\n\nThe news comes one day after the sports gossip blog Terez Owens reported that the Office Christmas Party star\u2019s ex Rodgers, 34, was spotted on a date with Patrick, 35. \u201cDanica and Aaron were all over each other, kissing and couldn\u2019t seem to keep their hands off each other,\u201d an eyewitness claimed to the site, noting that the NFL pro and the NASCAR driver had dinner together after Christmas at his favorite restaurant, Chives, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. \u201cThis is on the extreme down low, as they both want to keep this quiet for now. It\u2019s early but they are really hitting it off.\u201d\n\nA source also claimed to Us Weekly that the two athletes are dating.\n\nAs previously reported, Rodgers and Munn split in April 2017 after three years together. According to an insider, the duo ended their romance due to tension the model had with the quarterback\u2019s family. Meanwhile, Patrick and fellow race car driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. called it quits on their five-year relationship in December 2017.\n\nThe 23rd Annual Critics Choice Awards will air on the CW Thursday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/olivia-munn-hosting-critics-choice.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/olivia-munn-hosting-critics-choice.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/aaron-rodgers-olivia-munn.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/olivia-munn-hosting-critics-choice.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/olivia-munn-to-host-critics-choice-awards-2018/", "title": "Olivia Munn to Host Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Olivia Munn has landed a new gig after reports surfaced that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Olivia Munn to Host Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018", "description": "Olivia Munn has landed a new gig after reports surfaced that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/olivia-munn-to-host-critics-choice-awards-2018/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-05T18:55:10+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/olivia-munn-hosting-critics-choice.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/olivia-munn-hosting-critics-choice.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Award Shows", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-01-03T19:53:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-05T18:55:10+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Olivia Munn has landed a new gig after reports surfaced that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick \u2014 details", "title": "Olivia Munn to Host Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/olivia-munn-hosting-critics-choice.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515009230.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
