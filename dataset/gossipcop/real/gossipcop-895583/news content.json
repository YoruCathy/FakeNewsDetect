Many men have a lot to learn in this regard. I know I do, and I hope for and encourage that new direction.\u201d \u00bb\n\nResponse \u201cI am deeply sorry to the people I hurt. My behavior was wrong and inexcusable, and I accept full responsibility.\u201d \u00bb\n\nResponse \u201cI didn\u2019t grope anybody.
