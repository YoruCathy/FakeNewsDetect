It's a wrap\",[3] to which Lovato replied: \"Hola Fonsi\".[4] On November 1, 2017, MTV News reported that the collaboration will be titled \"\u00c9chame la Culpa\", a song Fonsi has been performing solo during live shows across the summer.[5] In an interview with Billboard at iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina in Miami, Fonsi admitted: \"It's a fun song, a fun record, we already filmed the video.\" He also revealed that the song would premiere in two weeks.[6] In a clip shared by Billboard on November 13, 2017, Lovato and Fonsi can be seen meeting each other via a FaceTime call to discuss details about their collaboration.[7] On November 14, 2017, Lovato took to social media to announce the song's release, along with a snippet of the song featuring only her part,[8][9][10][11] as Fonsi posted a shot of himself lying in bed with pillows covered in the song's title.[12][13] It was released onto iTunes for download three days later,[14] and Fonsi published a photo that day of a truck with him and Lovato on it, as well as short quotes, including \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa Demi?\" (English: What's up Demi?) and \"Hey Fonsi\".[15] Fonsi told Viva Latino: \"The lyrics are very joyful. It's that play on words, that famous clich\u00e9 of 'It's not you, it's me' that many of us have used.\"[16] On April 12, 2018, Fonsi performed the song live together with German singer Helene Fischer during a medley with \"Despacito\" at the German Echo Music Prize.[17]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe song received positive reviews from music critics. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song \"a jaunty, celebratory number\", and felt Lovato singing in clipped Spanish is \"only marginally less comfortable than the bumpy-edged English-language semi-soul she employs elsewhere on the song\".[18] Deepa Lakshmin of MTV News wrote that it is \"equally infectious\" as \"Despacito\".[19] Ross McNeilage of the same publication deemed the song \"an absolute powerhouse anthem that goes harder than 'Despacito' ever did\", and gave credit to \"Demi's flawless Spanish and [Fonsi and Lovato's] undeniable chemistry\".[20] Bianca Gracie of Fuse regarded it as \"a welcomed refresher away from the ongoing 'Despacito' takeover\".[21]\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nThe music video first takes place in Lovato's bedroom, before the duo meet up in an abandoned warehouse and hold a dance party.[22][23][24] In its first 24 hours of release, the video accrued more than 17.4 million views, a record for Lovato.[25]\n\nOn YouTube, the video became the third-fastest music video in history to reach 500 million views and the fifth-fastest to reach 1 billion views, being the fastest collaboration in history to reach these two milestones.[26] As of October 2019, it has received over 1.9 billion views, making it one of the site's 50 most-viewed videos.[27]\n\nLive performances [ edit ]\n\nFonsi and Lovato made their duet debut performance during Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, United States on March 30, 2018.[28] On April 12, 2018, Fonsi performed the song live together with German singer Helene Fischer during a medley with \"Despacito\" at the German Echo Music Prize.[29] On May 27, 2018, Fonsi performed the song with Lovato during the BBC Music's Biggest Weekend.[30] The song is included in both Luis Fonsi's Love + Dance World Tour and Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour set list.\n\nTrack listings [ edit ]\n\nDigital download[31]\n\n\"\u00c9chame la Culpa\" \u2013 2:53\n\nDigital download \u2013 Not on You remix[32]\n\n\"\u00c9chame la Culpa\" (Not on You remix) \u2013 2:53\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nRelease history [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Luis_Fonsi_and_Demi_Lovato_%C3%89chame_la_Culpa.jpg/220px-Luis_Fonsi_and_Demi_Lovato_%C3%89chame_la_Culpa.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Luis_Fonsi_and_Demi_Lovato_%C3%89chame_la_Culpa.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Luis_Fonsi_and_Demi_Lovato_%C3%89chame_la_Culpa.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89chame_la_Culpa", "title": "\u00c9chame la Culpa", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Luis_Fonsi_and_Demi_Lovato_%C3%89chame_la_Culpa.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
