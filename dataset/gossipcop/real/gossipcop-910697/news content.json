Production on the first season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race would kick off the next day, and in his usual introspective way, the drag superstar was thinking about the future. \u201cI remember being in that water on such a hot day thinking, from this moment on, my life will be very different,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd it absolutely has been since that day.\u201d\n\nRuPaul, who became the world\u2019s biggest drag star in the \u201990s with the release of his single, \u201cSupermodel (You Better Work),\u201d had been away from the limelight for about a decade when Logo picked up his show. But he sensed his third act might be his biggest. President Obama was about to be elected, and a new social and cultural order was in the air, the kind that made it possible to imagine drag thriving beyond underground culture. \u201cI knew the show\u2019s mission statement was to celebrate the art of drag,\u201d RuPaul said, explaining his early optimism about the show\u2019s appeal last month, four days before production on the show\u2019s tenth season began in Los Angeles. \u201cAnd I knew that drag has more significant meaning and power than just what it seems like on the surface \u2014 it speaks to the duality of our lives as humans on this planet.\u201d\n\nAs it has turned out, he wasn\u2019t fantasizing. Since Drag Race premiered in 2009, 11 seasons have aired, including two All-Star editions (a third was just picked up). The competition show with a car-race motif spawned three spinoffs, UnTucked, RuPaul\u2019s Drag U, and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race: Ruvealed, and led to the creation of RuPaul\u2019s DragCon, which has catapulted many of the show\u2019s 113 contestants to international stardom. Last season, Drag Race made the switch to Logo\u2019s sister network VH1, where its ratings doubled and popularity soared higher, jump-started by a Lady Gaga appearance in the premiere that clocked nearly 1 million viewers. In May, Saturday Night Live spoofed the cultural juggernaut during its most popular season in years, with a skit featuring Chris Pine and four other cast members as straight car mechanics who love Drag Race and engage in a lip-sync battle. Then came the kind of acceptance that RuPaul never anticipated, or even particularly desired: In July of this year, the series was nominated for a whopping eight Emmys, including outstanding reality competition. RuPaul also was nominated again for his work as host (he won the trophy last year), a job with several roles: tough taskmaster, therapist, runway slayer, judge.\n\nBut long before it gained mainstream acknowledgment, Drag Race had a devoted audience around the world, who knew there was something unusually real here from the start. \u201cI think about the young people out there in Saudi Arabia and Asia and South America and Wyoming, who have watched the show and have found refuge here with our girls and our vernacular and our outlook on life,\u201d RuPaul said, reflecting on the show\u2019s contributions. \u201cI feel that the legacy of our show, Drag Race, is in those young people, and they will carry that legacy with them for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nThe road to Drag Race was paved 32 years ago at a music seminar in Manhattan, when 24-year-old RuPaul met Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, the founders of World of Wonder Productions, who would become his managers and best friends. At the time, Barbato and Bailey were in a band called the Fabulous Pop Tarts and primarily managed music; RuPaul, meanwhile, was trying to sell his first record. \u201cWe came from the same background,\u201d RuPaul recalled. \u201cWe were all devotees of the church of Warhol. I had grown up reading Interview magazine and thinking my path was to move to New York, become a Warhol superstar, create a persona, and move to Hollywood. When Randy looked at me that day, I could see that he saw what I saw.\u201d Barbato says he recognized RuPaul\u2019s star quality immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing he has right now,\u201d Barbato says, \u201cbut back then it was hard for a lot of people to get beyond the wig and the heels.\u201d\n\nWorld of Wonder took on RuPaul as a client and hired him for Manhattan Cable, a TV magazine show that combined public-access cable clips with interviews, and later produced other shows with him in the U.K. Barbato started conversations with RuPaul about a reality show in 2004, around the time he and his frequent collaborator, Michelle Visage, began co-hosting a morning radio show in New York. Having just released Starrbooty, the fourth installment in his secret agent\u2013supermodel series, RuPaul was ready to return to show business, but he resisted the idea of a reality competition show because he believed the genre was mean-spirited. When Tom Campbell, a development executive who had worked at MTV, Warner Bros. Television, New Line Television, and ABC, joined World of Wonder two years later as head of development, he broached the subject with the drag star again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in doing anything that was going to cast drag in a negative light or ridicule it, but the winds of change changed my mind,\u201d RuPaul said. \u201cThe Obama movement was happening, and I could feel it in my bones that it was time.\u201d\n\nCampbell, who\u2019s now World of Wonder\u2019s chief creative officer, came up with the show\u2019s format and its titular pun, while the producers and RuPaul came up with challenges, based on obstacles the drag star faced early in his career. \u201cTom understood my voice and I knew he could write for my voice,\u201d RuPaul says, \u201cand I knew that I could really be myself with Randy and Fenton because they are my tribe. I knew they would look out for me.\u201d World of Wonder, which produces other non-scripted fare such as Million Dollar Listings and Wishful Drinking, envisioned the show debuting on Bravo or E!, but both networks turned it down. \u201cThey heard the pitch, which was a very good pitch, and everyone really loved Ru, but they were like [whispers] we can\u2019t do drag. You know we can\u2019t do drag. You get it. And it was like, really?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe had different expectations, but Logo ended up being the perfect place for the show. We\u2019ve been its biggest hit for as long as it\u2019s been on the air, and they\u2019ve let us make the show we want to make.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first season was shot while President George W. Bush was in office, but aired right after Obama\u2019s inauguration, which gave Drag Race its first viral hit: the introduction of the Rubama promo, featuring him as both President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe Rubama promo. Photo: Logo\n\n\u201cWe enjoyed and paralleled the Obama years and the opening up of our nation and of our government and inclusiveness and Drag Race hand in hand \u2014 no coincidence,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd we shot this last season, season nine, when Obama was in office. We were hoping Hillary would be next, and then we realized it was gonna be Trump. And our rallying cry was, \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race now more than ever.\u2019 People were hungry for it because the reality show in Washington is so upsetting.\u201d\n\nBailey thinks the current political movement is actually benefiting the show, and drag in general. \u201cAt the time we were starting out, it was just a general aura of conservatism, but now it\u2019s something different,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole point about drag is it doesn\u2019t ask anyone\u2019s permission. Drag and resistance go hand in hand.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s queens attract a lot of attention with their creativity, talent, and boldness, but Drag Race also stands out as the only show on TV that consistently features gay people from different ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cThe show has always offered hope about the human race,\u201d Barbato said. \u201cIt inspires the people who watch it. During these dark times, it is not only inspiring that die-hard fan base, but I think it has also inspired the industry a little bit. It might be part of why people might be more motivated to include us and invite us to the big kid\u2019s table.\u201d\n\nThey were like, [whispers] We can\u2019t do drag. You know we can\u2019t do drag. You get it. And it was like, Really?\n\nBefore RuPaul was nominated for the Emmy he won last year, he famously told Vulture in an interview he\u2019d \u201crather get an enema than an Emmy.\u201d He\u2019d done fine without mainstream acceptance up until that point, and didn\u2019t need it for validation. \u201cThe truth is I\u2019ve never done this for recognition; I do this because I love it,\u201d RuPaul said last month, reflecting on the show\u2019s eight nominations. \u201cBut my whole career has been on the fringe. Politically now, it feels like our collective narrative has been abandoned, like we\u2019re moving away from the openheartedness that we felt in the previous eight years. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I feel our show always deserved all of this, but maybe what you\u2019re seeing now is that Hollywood is picking up the slack since the country is going backwards.\u201d\n\nMaking political statements is not the show\u2019s mission, though the producers know the nature of drag and its unwillingness to conform cannot be excised from the political conversation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an agenda,\u201d Barbato said. \u201cWe are not particularly political. We are all big, loud gays; we always have been. But what makes us the happiest of anything about the nominations is to be making a show that recognizes actual artists and gives them a platform. And not just the queens who are on our show, by the way \u2014 people are now interested in drag in general.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s Emmys recognition drives home even louder what first-season winner BeBe Zahara Benet says she tried to convey in her season: \u201cIt gives us an opportunity to celebrate ourselves, and it tells little boys like me that you can make a career out of this. You can be a drag performer. Dressing up like a woman does not make me less of a man.\u201d\n\nFrom its first season, the success of Drag Race has lived on how expertly it weaves entertainment, comedy, and emotional truth to tell the story of personal transformation. What other reality show contestants have to sew their own costumes, do their own makeup and hair, tuck their you-know-whats, write songs or scripts, choreograph routines, and prepare a lip sync in less than a day? And nowhere else in the TV universe is there a reality host doling out wisdom, and messages of acceptance and tough love like on Drag Race.\n\n\u201cAll of us are in drag in some form or fashion, so when I am able to discover what a person\u2019s blockage is, I\u2019m actually always really talking to myself,\u201d RuPaul said, discussing the pep talks he often gives in the set\u2019s workroom. \u201cI see myself in them so I am able to understand where the self-doubt comes from. It\u2019s not something we designed to be part of the show, but it\u2019s an integral part of my personality.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast season\u2019s winner, Sasha Velour, the rose-petal dazzler, appreciates RuPaul\u2019s personal investment in each of the contestants. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of intimacy and mentorship that also makes for great TV,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen RuPaul is looking me in the eye \u2014 and telling me, \u2018You\u2019re a little too serious. Have you considered just like making a fart joke?\u2019 \u2014 at that point I know she has seen me very clearly.\u201d\n\nThe realness often goes deeper than that, and can be traced to the show\u2019s modest beginnings in a Burbank basement, where the control room was a closet and the queens hung out in a hallway during deliberations. \u201cIt was literally, What the fuck is this?\u201d RuPaul recalled of that first set. Their low-budget surroundings aside, in the first season alone, Ongina revealed she was HIV-positive, Shannel openly discussed her weight problems, and winner BeBe Zahara Benet shared her struggle with the strict gender expectations placed on her at home in Cameroon, Africa.\n\nEven in that freshman season production bubble \u2014 before viewers would hear RuPaul\u2019s famous cackle, his \u201cdon\u2019t fuck it up!\u201d admonitions, and catchphrases like, \u201cIt\u2019s time to lip sync for your liiiiiiife\u201d \u2014 BeBe Zahara sensed the show would act as an agent of change. \u201cWhen we were done filming, I felt that unless you are a coldhearted snake, there is no way that you will not identify with these personas on television,\u201d the 36-year-old Minneapolis resident said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I knew this thing was going to be big.\u201d\n\nUnless you are a cold-hearted snake, there is no way that you will not identify with these personas on television.\n\nNever mind the freshman season\u2019s laughable lighting and hazy lens filters \u2014 the crew literally greased up the camera lenses because RuPaul admittedly \u201cwanted to make sure that there were no rough edges, especially when it came to drag queens.\u201d One first-season fan was so taken by the new faces on TV, she didn\u2019t notice how fuzzy it all looked on her screen. \u201cIt\u2019s funny going back and seeing how blurry all the footage was and how orange it looks,\u201d season-nine winner Sasha Velour recalls. \u201cAt the time, I remember watching it and being so shocked to see people who were that queer-looking on TV. Up until that point, I was dressing up in drag, but I didn\u2019t live anywhere that had a drag bar scene. As the show aired, it started showing up in places, and I took my drag out of the bedroom and onto the stage as a direct result of watching Drag Race.\u201d\n\nFor RuPaul, the hardest part of the first season was picking a girl to \u201csashay away\u201d each week. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really prepared for the emotional roller coaster I would experience in eliminating girls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then after the first season, I realized that even the first girl who is eliminated becomes a star and is world famous, so it doesn\u2019t bother me as much.\u201d\n\nHe looks back on the first season as more of a pilot. From there, the show found its voice and rhythm, but not without its obstacles. In the early seasons, producers always felt their ambitions were bigger than Logo\u2019s small cable-network budget allowed. The network, which has has half the audience of VH1, wasn\u2019t even rated by Nielsen in the show\u2019s first season. (The second season of the show averaged 440,000 viewers.) Clearing some of the music RuPaul wanted was particularly challenging, as was making the set as glitzy and glamorous as possible. \u201cWhen we got Whitney Houston\u2019s \u2018It\u2019s Not Right But It\u2019s Okay\u2019 for last season\u2019s finale, we were all ahhhhh!\u201d Barbato said. \u201cAfter that, all the streams for Whitney\u2019s songs went up. We are selling product now.\u201d\n\nBy the time the third season rolled around, the producers hit their first major production disappointment: Raja was leaked as the winner online before the finale aired. \u201cI was so angry about that because I think it\u2019s just rotten,\u201d RuPaul said. \u201cBut I woke up one morning and I was in that weird time between sleep and waking and it occurred to me in that moment to shoot three different endings. I thought, That will fix those motherfuckas! So no one knew who won season four until it came on television.\u201d\n\nThe fourth season stood out for more than its surprise ending. The prize money grew to $100,000, from $20,000 in season one, and the world met Sharon Needles, that cycle\u2019s winner. \u201cShe introduced a gender-fuck style of drag and did it flawlessly and in a loving, heartfelt way,\u201d RuPaul said. \u201cIt felt like we turned a corner.\u201d\n\nThat was the year that seventh-season winner Violet Chachki, who was 21 when she competed and conquered the runway with her extreme confidence and sense of style, started thinking about auditioning, even though she had been watching it since she was in high school. \u201cSeason four was the turning point for a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when drag became introduced more as an art form, and it became really, really popular within the gay community. The drag that was represented was different, refreshing, and new. You could see that the girls really started to make money, and it started to become more of a business.\u201d\n\nBefore she appeared on Drag Race, Violet Chachki worked in a pizza restaurant and performed in drag four or five nights a week just to get by. \u201cI was making enough to survive, but it wasn\u2019t anything like the kind of budget I\u2019m getting now,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy to compare the two, you know? It really does change your life.\u201d She\u2019s not alone. Thanks to the show, and the success of DragCon, which will be held in New York for the first time next month, many Drag Race alum are making over $100,000 annually touring, selling merchandise, recording, and in endorsements. \u201cThese girls are huge stars all over the world,\u201d Barbato added. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nAs the show blew up internationally via Netflix (it began streaming worldwide in November 2013 and is now available in 30 countries) and gay bars threw viewing parties across the country, Drag Race had become popular enough to court controversy. It hit its biggest one to date in its sixth season when it featured a \u201cFemale or She-Male?\u201d challenge, in which the queens had to guess whether celeb portraits were of \u201cbiological\u201d or \u201cpsychological\u201d women. The game was met with outcry from viewers who found it offensive; Logo responded by issuing an apology, removing the episode from all of its platforms, and also removing the \u201cYou\u2019ve Got She-Mail\u201d challenge intro from new episodes. RuPaul and the producers issued a joint statement at the time: \u201cWe delight in celebrating every color in the LGBT rainbow. When it comes to the movement of our trans sisters and trans brothers, we are newly sensitized and more committed than ever to help spread love, acceptance and understanding.\u201d\n\nReflecting back on it, RuPaul doesn\u2019t indicate that he would\u2019ve done anything differently. \u201cI was upset with the fact that people would think our intention was malicious,\u201d he said. \u201cOur show has always come from a place of love and the people who called us out, they knew our position was a place of love. They intentionally misinterpreted our intention to further their cause and to bring attention to themselves.\u201d\n\nTo replace the segment, RuPaul came up with a new intro to the mini challenges, which premiered in the seventh season and became an instant classic: \u201cShe done already done had herses.\u201d He had overheard a girl at Krystal Burgers in Atlanta say the phrase one night over 30 years ago when another girl tried to pick up her bag of food, and he never forgot it. \u201cThe proper English way of saying that is, \u2018No, she has already had hers,\u2019\u201d RuPaul recalls. \u201cWhen I heard that, I thought, oh my God, I\u2019ve got to write that down.\u201d Campbell laughs thinking about the phone call with network executives to let them know what RuPaul\u2019s new line would be. \u201cThey were like, What? And I was like, Trust me,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve shown, I think, is this beautiful thing \u2014 what attracts people also is against what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\u2019s like if your insecurities or feelings were on the outside.\u201d\n\nRuPaul sees the controversy as just another example of the show\u2019s ability to adapt and build upon itself. \u201cThe producers and I, we are also crafty queens, and we know how to turn something into something even better,\u201d he adds. \u201cSomebody wanna steal our ideas? Go ahead! We got plenty!\u201d\n\nWhile Drag Race itself has borrowed from other reality-show formats \u2014 Project Runway, American\u2019s Next Top Model, and even a failed World of Wonder show \u00a1Viva Hollywood! \u2014 RuPaul is alluding to the idea that straight culture has taken from gay culture. Drag Race has most notably influenced other popular shows that now feature various forms of lip-sync contests. On The Tonight Show, celebrities and Jimmy Fallon battle it out in a lip-sync competition; on The Late Late Show celebrities compete with James Corden in rap battles. Both of those segments have led to the creation of stand-alone shows: Spike\u2019s Lip Sync Battle and TBS\u2019s Drop the Mic. Although Fallon and Stephen Merchant have said the idea for their lip-sync competition did not evolve from Drag Race, lip-syncing has been intrinsic to drag culture for decades.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t as easily replicable is the show\u2019s heart. Violet Chachki says she is still taken aback by how much the show makes her cry as the queens share their pain and struggles with identity, family relationships, loss or other personal issues. \u201cI mean, it happens all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI know these people and I know the show and I know how it works, but here I am tearing up watching a show that I\u2019ve been on. It\u2019s really powerful stuff.\u201d\n\nIt happens behind the scenes, too. When Roxxxy Andrews broke down on the runway in the fifth season and spoke about being abandoned by her mother at a bus stop, everyone became emotional, including RuPaul. \u201cPeople in the control room will be crying, but nobody is acknowledging it,\u201d Barbato said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a moment where the control room just goes silent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the one aspect of the show RuPaul says he did not foresee that afternoon in the pool. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how poignant and how deep the show would be,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that we were going to celebrate the art of drag, but I didn\u2019t know the several levels of importance the show would have. It means a lot to me because I\u2019ve been famous for many years. I\u2019ve done very well and made a great living at it. But, ultimately, all of that really does fade away, and what you\u2019re left with is what you did to be of service to human beings on this planet. And I feel I\u2019ve been a part of something that has been of service to humans on this planet because of our show.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0f/545/a6507dd15d36e93f7afed65dc948eca103-22-rupaul-history-1.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c5e/b17/e06267efe320eabc32d3a066d55490d1d8-22-rubama.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/22/22-rupaul-history-1.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0f/545/a6507dd15d36e93f7afed65dc948eca103-22-rupaul-history-1.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Elena Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/behind-the-rise-of-rupauls-drag-race.html", "title": "Behind the Rise of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Behind the Rise of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, the Realest Show on TV", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/behind-the-rise-of-rupauls-drag-race.html", "description": "\u201cI remember thinking, from this moment on, my life will be very different.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0f/545/a6507dd15d36e93f7afed65dc948eca103-22-rupaul-history-1.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Behind the Rise of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race", "description": "\u201cI remember thinking, from this moment on, my life will be very different.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0f/545/a6507dd15d36e93f7afed65dc948eca103-22-rupaul-history-1.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-22T13:25:33.240-04:00", "tag": "rupaul's drag race, drag race, rupaul, tv, vulture homepage lede, emmys 2017, emmy insider, emmys", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "A look at the evolution of \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u2019, which is nominated for eight Emmys this year.", "sailthru.tags": "rupaul's drag race, drag race, rupaul, tv, vulture homepage lede, emmys 2017, emmy insider, emmys", "author": "Maria Elena Fernandez", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503422733.24, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
