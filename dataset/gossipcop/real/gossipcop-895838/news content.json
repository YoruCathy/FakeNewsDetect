Well, with the console wars hotting up (hello, PS5 and Xbox Series X) the current consoles will surely drop in price to make way for their 2020 counterparts.\n\nApple's AirPods Pro will be longer in the tooth by then, so we're expecting big discounts there (even more than the $15 drop this year) and the AirPods Classic might even creep closer to $100, which would be a great saving and see Apple clean up on the stocking front.\n\nHowever, there's nothing this year that suggests the likes of Instant Pot, TVs, laptops (which were huge this year too) along with Amazon's best own-brand products won't be the things to wait to buy on Black Friday 2020 - so expect more of the same and time your top purchases accordingly.\n\nThe top Black Friday deals we saw last year\n\nHP Laptop 15t: $979.99 $519.99 from HP\n\nThis HP laptop was a phenomenal price and came with a 15-inch display paired with a powerful 10th gen Intel Core i7 processor to power the whole thing. It also had 256GB of SSD storage onboard with Windows 10 built-in.View Deal\n\nPowerbeats Pro wireless earphones | $249.95 $199.95 at Amazon\n\nPowerbeats Pro were available for $50 off at Amazon, offering up to nine hours of the high quality audio you'd expect from Beats.

You could pick it up in Gold or Space Grey and enjoy all the latest features for less.\n\nView Deal\n\niPhone 11 for $699 at Verizon | Get up to $400 off the iPhone 11 with select trade-in and Unlimited\n\nA big hitter, you could get up to $400 off the iPhone 11 if you traded in a select phone, and if you switched to an Unlimited plan with your handset you could also get a $400 prepaid Mastercard too.

We did, and now we won't be saying \"Oh, I wish I had a Hulu subscription\" at any point in 2020. View Deal\n\nXbox One X | Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order: $499 $349 at Best Buy\n\nThe Xbox One X is still one of the most powerful consoles on the market right now, and this early Black Friday deal made it finally affordable.

Yes, that's how limited this Black Friday AirPods deal was \u2013 it sold out twice on us until it finally died.

And what is it?\n\nBlack Friday is the Friday immediately after Thanksgiving when retailers begin the holiday shopping season. It\u2019s based around the aforementioned \u201cdoorbusters\u201d, discounts so impressive that bargain-crazed customers will try to break the doors down before the shop opens - although that\u2019s more of a virtual craze these days.\n\nThe actual date shifts every year, by the day of the week stays the same: it's always the Friday after Thanksgiving, and like last year it's later in the month of November.\n\nThe official Black Friday date is November 27, 2020, meaning it's close to Christmas again (less than a month before Christmas Day), and that gives you less time to shop online.\n\nThat may not seem like a big deal today, but you'll have to factor in waiting on the best deals, pouncing on the lowest price, and factoring shipping wait times.\n\nAs we've highlighted, Black Friday weekend isn't just a four-day affair, and deals don't necessarily follow the normal pattern of prime products to be unleashed - you can see new TV deals in the small hours of the morning or a brilliant wearable price slash just after the Thanksgiving turkey is prepped, so shoppers need to be more flexible than ever.\n\nThe origin of Black Friday: a history lesson\n\nImage credit: Shutterstock (Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nLet\u2019s take a Black Friday history lesson: the first known mention of Black Friday related to this shopping experience was in November 1951, when the journal Factory Management and Maintenance used it to describe people calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving so they could have an extra day off work.\n\nAt the same time US police were using the phrases \u201cBlack Friday\u201d and \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d to describe the horrendous traffic that occurred at the beginning of the pre-Christmas shopping season. In 1961 there was a movement from the local government to change the shopping season to \u201cBig Friday\u201d and \u201cBig Saturday\u201d, but it clearly never caught on.\n\nBlack Friday ads: when will we see them?\n\nBest Buy, Walmart, Amazon and Target have a habit of stretching the saving across multiple days preceding the classic four-day window, posting Black Friday ad leaks in October and early November.\n\nTrust us when we say we'll be monitoring the Black Friday ads hard this year, and giving you all the information as they drop.\n\nThe first signs of price drops come from these ad leaks, usually through major US newspaper print outs. Black Friday ad scans make their way online, giving you a heads-up on what to buy, how much to spend and where to shop.\n\nThis means Black Friday is more than just a one-day sales frenzy, or even an extended weekend tradition. It's a whole month of savings, if you know where to shop and when to hit that checkout button. If you\u2019re savvy, it's the best time of the year to shop, and you can save a lot of money.\n\nImage credit: TechRadar\n\nWill Black Friday 2020 be different in any way?\n\nBlack Friday 2020 should continue last year's trend of not just offering discounts, but offering discounts on items you'll actually want to buy. There was some fierce competition between Amazon, Walmart, B&H Photo and Best Buy last year, and that's a good sign given payday will fall after Black Friday in 2020.\n\nSpecifically, we're expecting to see big-ticket items like 4KTVs with HDR support \u2013 a once expensive proposition, and Apple to offer cheap iPads, which was a big hit last year again. Essentially, that's more of the same. Beauty products and non-electricals should continue to increase in popularity as more brands and retailers look to take advantage of the Black Friday interest, particularly online.\n\nThe AirPods Pro, as mentioned, may see the older models on sale for a better price, while laptops, iPhones and Android smartphones should be at their lowest levels in 2020 once more.\n\nIt's not a surprise that Apple launches new iPhones in September to discount them (just a little bit) by Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This mostly happens through US carriers and BYGO Free deals, with some lovely cashback options last year as well to really sweeten the pot.\n\nHow does TechRadar prepare for Black Friday? Black Friday is one of the most important times of the year for TechRadar - we spend weeks ahead of the big day (or weekend) making sure the whole site is ready for people looking for the information they need to help them make the right buying choice. Whether that's knowing which is the best laptop, TV or iPad, or just seeing great deals for them through our Hawk price comparison widget, we've got everything you need to know.\n\nAre Black Friday deals real?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes - although there are two kinds of deals. The first has been pre-agreed between brands and retailers, so they\u2019re not as off-the-cuff as you might expect.\n\nThe other is sudden price drops, whether that\u2019s an algorithm working out the best way to attract users to buy (as brands like Amazon often will) or just the big names price-matching one another, or pushing the price down further as they look to be the big winner. (We saw something similar with iPads in the US).\n\nAs with any sales event you\u2019ll see a mixture of bargains, discounted end-of-line stock and strange things found in the back of a warehouse somewhere. In 2016, consumer magazine 'Which?' accused retailers of some pretty dodgy behavior.\n\nYou might notice that some items are cheaper after Black Friday - even as soon as Cyber Monday. But those are part of the natural Christmas discounting period, and our advice is to always grab a deal if you like it, and be prepared to return if it drops lower.\n\nWhere can I find the best Black Friday deals?\n\nAs mentioned, you\u2019ll find the best options if you bookmark this page right now - there will be deals from the beginning of November 2020, and we\u2019ll be bringing you the best of them, those that we think are worth checking out, the second that we see them flash up.\n\nHow do I get the best Black Friday deals in 2020?\n\nHomework really helps. Some retailers up prices from August through to October so they can offer supposedly amazing discounts on Black Friday, so don\u2019t be fooled by such moves.\n\nThey\u2019re particularly prevalent in expensive consumer electronics such as TVs or laptops with product numbers rather than names, with products that were dropped down to a great bargain price suddenly being pushed back to their MSRP again.\n\nIt\u2019s also a very good idea to be flexible: for example, if you fancy a Samsung UHD TV it\u2019s best to think about the features you want rather than a specific model number: the BRV553ABD34-82C-9218-X may not be discounted on Black Friday 2020, but an almost identical set with the specification you want probably will be.\n\nSo do your research on what matters and we\u2019ll do our best to give you the right comparison needed.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that something that looks like a five star set is the same but cheaper - certain elements (often with regards to screen quality or image processing) won\u2019t be as high quality to achieve that lower price point.\n\nCan I get cashback on Black Friday deals?\n\nSometimes, yes. Your debit card or credit card may offer cashback on purchases. It\u2019s definitely worth looking into, not just for Black Friday 2020 but for any online shopping, when you\u2019ll be spending the most online.\n\nAm I protected when I buy on Black Friday?\n\nIn general, you should be just as protected as you are when shopping any other time of the year. You\u2019ll want to check on return policies and warranty periods, and you should also make sure you\u2019re shopping at known retailers you trust.\n\nWhile many deals can seem too good to be true on Black Friday, landing on an unfamiliar website claiming to have a product for pennies on the dollar is a good sign you\u2019re in the wrong place.\n\nRemember that using your credit card also can offer a level of protection, so as long as you have the means to pay it back straight away, using this method can give you more peace of mind.\n\nMany credit cards can help you contest payments if you never receive a product, and some even offer extended warranties on products beyond the one included from manufacturer or retailer.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXHiMjLENZkzcz7wtHkmAe-320-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXHiMjLENZkzcz7wtHkmAe-1200-80.jpg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXHiMjLENZkzcz7wtHkmAe-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gareth Beavis", "Matt Swider"], "canonical_link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-deals-2019", "title": "Black Friday 2020: the top deals we're expecting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2019-12-23T16:48:39+00:00", "description": "The Black Friday sales are over for another year - but what have we learned to help us save money in 2020?", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/174424/apple-touch-icon.png", "og": {"title": "Black Friday 2020: the top deals we're expecting", "site_name": "TechRadar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-deals-2019", "description": "What can we learn from the previous deals?", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXHiMjLENZkzcz7wtHkmAe-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TechRadar", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/TechRadar"}, "fb": {"app_id": 235441786508054}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TechRadar", "title": "Black Friday 2020: the top deals we're expecting", "description": "What can we learn from the previous deals?", "creator": "@TechRadar", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXHiMjLENZkzcz7wtHkmAe-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 15560223}, "google-site-verification": "jEzBNX-r47v-rgc86g7xG47qMqF4VJuXdLUueTx8saU", "p": {"domain_verify": "10329f1fd4d0a2cd5c0d3b3b809cb4cd"}, "OMG-Verify-V1": "1036697-2d2c9025-5430-4e79-8349-e8c1c926dd73", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-deals-2019"}, "botify-site-verification": "xkNFqB6l1qBl8BEqMjQvrHuYinhxlJVe", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E", "theme-color": "#2f6e91", "lomadee-verification": 22816996, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "wT8vJMUSL8GrB8EYX5yuPg", "parsely-pub-date": "2019-12-23T16:48:39Z", "parsely-title": "Black Friday 2020: the top deals we're expecting", "parsely-link": "https://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-deals-2019", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iXHiMjLENZkzcz7wtHkmAe.jpg", "parsely-section": "Black Friday", "parsely-tags": "Category: Black Friday,Category: Other,Category: News,deals,techdeals,Black Friday,Black Friday sales,black friday deals,holiday,black friday 2020,deals,techdeals,Black Friday,Black Friday sales,black friday deals,holiday,black friday 2020,Internet,type_deal,_van_ads_none,van-disable-inbody-ads,tr-holidays-19,deals,channel_other,blackfridayhub,_van_disable_sidebar,van-block-taboola,exclude-from-homepage,type_deal,_van_ads_none,van-disable-inbody-ads,tr-holidays-19,deals,channel_other,blackfridayhub,_van_disable_sidebar,van-block-taboola,exclude-from-homepage", "parsely-author": "Matt Swider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1577119719.0, "source": "https://www.techradar.com", "summary": ""}
