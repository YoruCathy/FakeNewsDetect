By the time he stirred, the Crock-Pot fire fans saw begin last week had consumed the house. But it wasn\u2019t the fire itself that killed Jack\u2014a detail that makes his death all the more devastating.\n\nLast episode, fans watched Jack live out his last day, right up until the moment the camera ominously loomed on the family Crock-Pot\u2014as it set the kitchen ablaze. The slow cooker, fans learned, had been a gift from the family who previously owned the house\u2014and its notoriously tricky switch appeared to be what would ultimately lead to Jack\u2019s demise. Well, that and the Pearsons\u2019 smoke detector, which we already knew had no batteries inside it.\n\nStill, it was unclear how exactly Jack died in the house fire. The clues had been floating around for months, but now they finally came together to form one gut-wrenching episode.\n\nThis week, once he realized the house was on fire, Jack gathered Rebecca, Randall, and Kate (Kevin was not home the night of the fire). He lowered the kids and Rebecca to the ground from the second floor\u2014which is when their dog, Louie, began barking. Kate screamed for the dog, but he didn\u2019t come out on his own. Bent on saving their pet, Jack went back in the house, successfully saving Louie, as well as a few of the family\u2019s prized possessions: a photo album and a copy of Kate\u2019s audition tape to music school.\n\n\u201cYou are something else,\u201d Rebecca said as they sat together in an ambulance, along with a concerned paramedic. Jack\u2019s response? A typically humble \u201cI try.\u201d Paramedics wanted Jack to get to a hospital, concerned about the amount of smoke he\u2019d inhaled, but he and Rebecca wanted to drop the kids off at Miguel's first. The doctor proclaimed Jack\u2019s minor swelling to be a \u201cmiracle,\u201d and despite appearing a little absentminded, Jack was in good humor and seemed fine. Unfortunately, as Rebecca booked a hotel, spoke to the kids on the waiting-room phone, and picked out a snack from the vending machine, Jack died of cardiac arrest. Kate blames herself, we learned, because of all the things Jack retrieved for her\u2014because, as she put it, \u201che couldn\u2019t bear to disappoint me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a bit disconcerting to watch NBC turn Jack\u2019s demise into a TV \u201cevent\u201d in the same vein as deaths on more gruesome shows\u2014like The Walking Dead, which has faced accusations of manipulative storytelling in recent seasons. To some, this might undercut the NBC drama\u2019s reputation for sweetness and empathy\u2014a series about family of good, relatable people trying their best throughout difficult circumstances. Whatever some might think of the show\u2019s chosen setup, however, it delivered exactly what it promised: one hell of a post-Super Bowl tearjerker.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a4474fd577ffb294a2534d9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/EOY-Best-TV-Shows-Movies-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a67ef13cfc0a90b395671e4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/NUP_181159_3703.JPG", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a4470e28ae8fd2b3a999df0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/EOY-Best-TV-Shows-Movies-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a4474fef3c68c7e92305270/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/EOY-Best-TV-Shows-Movies-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6a61f98c8c33197dfe2f83/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/sad-jack-crock-pot.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle", "Emma Stefansk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/this-is-us-jack-death-reveal-fire-kate-how-did-jack-die", "title": "This Is Us: Why Jack\u2019s Death Was Even More Haunting Than Fans Expected", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "As it turns out, what killed the beloved Pearson patriarch was probably not what you thought.", "id": "5a77c7cc470e4a2065a6d8ec", "keywords": "television,this is us,nbc", "news_keywords": "television,this is us,nbc", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a77c7cc470e4a2065a6d8ec", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"As it turns out, what killed the beloved Pearson patriarch was probably not what you thought.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG\"}", "og": {"description": "As it turns out, what killed the beloved Pearson patriarch was probably not what you thought.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "This Is Us: Why Jack\u2019s Death Was Even More Haunting Than Fans Expected", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/this-is-us-jack-death-reveal-fire-kate-how-did-jack-die"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "As it turns out, what killed the beloved Pearson patriarch was probably not what you thought.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a77ca3bf69c483c99ff7f63/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NUP_180092_1081.JPG?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "This Is Us: Why Jack\u2019s Death Was Even More Haunting Than Fans Expected"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
