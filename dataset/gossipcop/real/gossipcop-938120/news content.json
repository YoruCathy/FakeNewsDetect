After a fan asked Grande if the symbol had a hidden meaning, the pop star simply stated that it was because she was feeling \u201cempty.\u201d\n\n\u201cjk i\u2019m empty and my heart is black now so,\u201d she tweeted on Nov. 15.\n\nImage zoom Ariana Grande\u2019s tweet Ariana Grande/Twitter\n\nRELATED: Every Single Tattoo Pete Davidson & Ariana Grande Have Gotten to Make Their Love Permanent\n\nDavidson and Grande have a total of five shared designs and nine total tattoos inspired by their whirlwind romance.\n\nThe former couple also shared clouds on their finger, the quote \u201cmille tendresse\u201d from the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s on the backs of their necks, and \u201c8418\u201d in honor of Davidson\u2019s late father who died in 9/11 on the singer\u2019s ankle and the comedian\u2019s arm.\n\nIn addition, the pair had the word \u201creborn\u201d and \u201cH2GKMO\u201d (an abbreviation of Grande\u2019s favorite saying, \u201cHonest to God, knock me out\u201d) on their thumbs \u2014 which they got after getting engaged in June.
