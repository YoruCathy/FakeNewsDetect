Both women were critical of the actor\u2019s decision to wear a badge supporting the Time\u2019s Up movement at the ceremony. Franco was later forced to deny the rumours during an interview with The Late Show host Stephen Colbert, describing the claims as \u201cnot accurate\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 1:38 James Franco discusses recent sexual misconduct allegations \u2013 video\n\nTither-Kaplan, who has starred in several films directed by Franco, told the LA Times that the actor-director had engaged in an \u201cabuse of power\u201d on the set of his films, alleging that during one sex scene Franco removed protective plastic guards covering the genitalia of female actors while simulating oral sex with them.\n\nTither-Kaplan also claimed that one actor was sent home from a film set after balking at appearing topless in a scene. \u201cI got it in my head pretty quickly that, OK, you don\u2019t say no to this guy,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother student, Hilary Dusome claimed that Franco had created an \u201cunprofessional and hostile atmosphere\u201d during a scene filmed in a strip club by asking a group of female actors: \u201cSo, who wants to take your shirt off?\u201d Dusome says that Franco \u201cstormed off\u201d after none of the actors volunteered. Two other female student actors made similar claims, saying that Franco became angry when no women at the shoot would agree to be topless.\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt like I was selected for something based on my hard work and my merit, and when I realised it was because I have nice [breasts], it was pretty clear that was not the case,\u201d Dusome said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he started teaching with bad intentions, but he went down a bad path and damaged a lot of people in the process.\u201d\n\nPaley, who had a romantic relationship with Franco in 2016, claims that the actor pressured her into performing oral sex on him while sitting in a car. \u201cI was talking to him, all of a sudden his penis was out,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cI got really nervous, and I said, \u2018Can we do this later?\u2019 He was kind of nudging my head down, and I just didn\u2019t want him to hate me, so I did it.\u201d She added that Franco later called to make amends with her, though he insisted that he had done \u201cnothing illegal\u201d.\n\nIn a statement to the LA Times, Franco\u2019s attorney Michael Plonsker disputed the claims, directing readers to the comments made by the actor during the Late Show interview. \u201cThe things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,\u201d Franco told Colbert. \u201cBut I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long. So I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way.\u201d\n\nPlonsker also specifically addressed Tither-Kaplan\u2019s allegation regarding the protective guards and those made by Paley, describing both as \u201cnot accurate\u201d.\n\nFollowing the claims made against Franco, the New York Times cancelled an event featuring the actor that had been scheduled for yesterday. However, he has otherwise continued to make public appearances. Last night he appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers, where he was again asked about the allegations.\n\n\u201cI have my own side of this story, but I believe in these people that have been underrepresented getting their stories out, enough that I will hold back things that I could say, just because I believe in it that much,\u201d Franco told Meyers. \u201cIf I have to take a knock, because I am not going to try and actively refute things, then I will, because I believe in it that much.\u201d", "images":
