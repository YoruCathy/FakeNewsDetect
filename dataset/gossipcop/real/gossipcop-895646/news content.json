She has a completely different life,\u201d he explained. \u201c[But] I\u2019m proud of her. She\u2019s very talented. It\u2019s hard for me to even accept how old she is now.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Katie and David Cassidy in 2007 Krista Kennell/ZUMA\n\nRELATED: David Cassidy \u2014 Looking Back at the Late Teen Heartthrob\u2019s Ups and Downs\n\nDavid had been in intensive care since he was hospitalized for liver and kidney failure last week.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire Cassidy family, it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, our uncle, and our dear brother, David Cassidy,\u201d his family said in a statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday. \u201cDavid died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long.
