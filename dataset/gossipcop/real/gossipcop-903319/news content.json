Off.\n\nIf I'm mad, it's because of my investment. Growing up with \"The X-Files,\" I spent way too much of my free time watching the show, staying up late to record it on VHS and scouring Rochester-area video stores for the full set of official tapes. And as I watched, I tried to piece together Carter's mythology: Why some green-blooded aliens could be killed by gunshots but the Alien Bounty Hunter couldn't, why the alien artifact made Mulder telepathic but not Scully despite both of them having been exposed to the black oil, why Krycek did just about anything in his ratboy life.\n\nIf the plot turns of \"My Struggle III\" didn't make the fruitlessness of my obsession clear enough, another pair of clumsily written scenes did. The first was when Mulder and Skinner were at each other's throats on nothing more than a macho whim, and the second was when Skinner once again decided to do CSM's bidding in order to save Mulder and Scully's lives.", "images": ["data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAAEElEQVR42mM8U88ABowYDABAxQPltt5zqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==",
