While many would assume he\u2019s always been successful with the ladies, that was not the case when he was younger.\n\nDuring his recent appearance at the Graham Norton Show, the 35-year-old actor revealed that he went through great lengths to impress girls in order to \u201cget lucky\u201d. Just like many others, Dornan too had a typical awkward teenager story. Although one might say, his embarrassing story is more R-rated than romantic.\n\nIn \u201cone of the worst stories in my locker\u201d, Dornan recalled, \u201cI was quite small and wasn\u2019t hairy at all \u2013 I was 15 and looked seven. On one particular day, I was in an amateur drama play and was going to a party after. For my role, I had bits of a black wig glued to my face for a beard and I decided to keep it for the party so I would look older. I also decided to cut up the rest of wig and glue it to my private parts just in case I got lucky\u201c.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat reckless move backfired on the young Brit when it came time to remove the improvised pubic hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t get lucky and removing the bits of wig ripped out the very small amount of natural hair I had down there. It was a physically and emotionally painful experience!\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, the handsome star also shared about the \u201cawful\u201d scene to shoot in \u201cFifty Shades Freed\u201c. In the movie trailer, we see the shirtless Christian Grey in blue shorts walking out of the beach in France. \u201cThat was horrendous. If they just tilt the camera down, that whole moment was awful,\u201d Dornan told the host.\n\n\u201cWe had the beach, semi-sort of closed off, but actually there were loads of people that we didn\u2019t have control over.They want me to be sexy coming out of the water. But it\u2019s not a sand beach! It\u2019s one of those wee pebble beaches. Literally, you cannot look cool running out of the water,\u201d he added.\n\nWatch his confessions here:\n\nHonestly, his awkwardness just makes adorable \ud83d\ude09\n\nSources: Just Jared, Daily Mail.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20696%20392'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Colin-Firth-Kingsman-100x70.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jamie-dornan-2017.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2096%2096'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/maxresdefault-27-218x150.jpg", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/s150x150/29416924_334914413696731_2679382061613056000_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&_nc_ohc=jKFlcylSfS8AX9jGWW9&oh=d245f4d60664583fc3db10b7fddeef19&oe=5EC5047F", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EVjjkmLUUAAV6T8-620x378-1-100x70.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=igWyi1a4ZP00gV", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20218%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Justin_avatar_1517135623-96x96.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-24-at-10.24.13-e1529761044993-218x150.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2daf-100x70.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/92069096_123393125950462_6759301457498865664_n-100x70.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tribe-boxing-studio-100x70.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20696%20867'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2070'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1111-100x70.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/50-shades-sex-scene-218x150.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hype-Logo-2016-dark-background.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-large.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/movie-sequels-100x70.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Insidious-100x70.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-100x70.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2040%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fifty-shades-freed-2018.-218x150.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2090%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pinterest--218x150.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screen-shot-2015-06-23-at-14-39-51-218x150.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tom-holland-100x70.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hype-Logo-2016-300x161.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Hype-Logo-2016-dark-background-300x161.png", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dining-With-A-View-KL-100x70.jpg", "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jamie-dornan-.png"], "top_img": "https://hype.my/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jamie-dornan-.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Usually Awkward", "Quiet", "But Gets Talkative Once The Conversation Revolves Around Movies", "Tv Shows", "Music", "Entertainment.", "Contact"], "canonical_link": "https://hype.my/2018/151188/jamie-dornan-glued-wig-penis/", "title": "Jamie Dornan Once Glued A Wig To His Penis To Impress Girls", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jamie Dornan Once Glued A Wig To His Penis To Impress Girls", "description": "Jamie Dornan has become a sex symbol since taking on the role of Christian Grey in the\u00a0\"Fifty Shades\" franchise.
