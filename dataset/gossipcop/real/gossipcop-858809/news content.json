Demi Lovato seemingly threw shade at Kathy Griffin on Twitter on Friday, June 2, after the comedian\u2019s press conference about her controversial Donald Trump photo shoot.\n\n\u201cI find it funny when bullies play the victim,\u201d the singer, 24, tweeted. A few minutes later, she added, \u201cOops. I spilled my tea.\u201d\n\nEagle-eyed fans also noticed that Lovato \u201cliked\u201d her mom Dianna De La Garza\u2019s tweet, which read, \u201cSo @kathygriffin states she will continue making fun of people, kinda like she made fun of my daughter @ddlovato for going into treatment.\u201d\n\nDuring her tearful press conference, Griffin, 56, accused Trump, 70, and his family of \u201cbullying\u201d her after she shared a photo of herself holding a prop intended to represent the president\u2019s decapitated, bloody head. \u201cTrust me, if I could redo the whole thing, I\u2019d have a blow-up doll and no ketchup,\u201d Griffin told the audience on Friday.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Lovato and the stand-up comic have taken their feud to social media. In 2014, a fan asked Griffin to call out the \u201cbiggest douche celebrity.\u201d She responded, \u201cProbably Debbie Lovato.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-kathy-griffin-38f13cca-12dc-4ed4-af5e-2dcda8d0a051.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-kathy-griffin-1f8e1147-fe18-4e43-b110-54d6399c58b9.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-kathy-griffin-38f13cca-12dc-4ed4-af5e-2dcda8d0a051.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/did-demi-lovato-throw-shade-at-kathy-griffin-w485703/", "title": "Did Demi Lovato Throw Shade at Kathy Griffin?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Demi Lovato seemingly threw shade at Kathy Griffin on Twitter on Friday, June 2, after the comedian's press conference about Donald Trump \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Did Demi Lovato Throw Shade at Kathy Griffin?", "description": "Demi Lovato seemingly threw shade at Kathy Griffin on Twitter on Friday, June 2, after the comedian's press conference about Donald Trump \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/did-demi-lovato-throw-shade-at-kathy-griffin-w485703/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:01:15+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-kathy-griffin-38f13cca-12dc-4ed4-af5e-2dcda8d0a051.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-kathy-griffin-38f13cca-12dc-4ed4-af5e-2dcda8d0a051.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-06-03T14:09:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:01:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Demi Lovato seemingly threw shade at Kathy Griffin on Twitter on Friday, June 2, after the comedian's press conference about Donald Trump \u2014 details", "title": "Did Demi Lovato Throw Shade at Kathy Griffin?", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-kathy-griffin-38f13cca-12dc-4ed4-af5e-2dcda8d0a051.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496498992.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
