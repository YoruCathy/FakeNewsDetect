What her daughter did at my home\u2026 was racist, learned behavior etc,\u201d Leakes, 50, alleged in a comment on Instagram, adding, \u201cKim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.\u201d\n\nImage zoom NeNe Leakes, Brielle Biermann and Kim Zolciak-Biermann David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty; Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty\n\nRELATED: \u2018Close Your Legs to Married Men\u2019: A Brief History of Kim Zolciak-Biermann & NeNe Leakes\u2019 Rocky Friendship\n\nLooking back on Sunday at what happened, Leakes said that she called Kim and Brielle \u201cracists\u201d because of their use of the term \u201croaches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018roach\u2019 just ain\u2019t the word I needed to hear her saying,\u201d Leakes said. \u201cIt sounds very racial when you are speaking to an African-American person and talk about roaches. Because people feel like you associated that with the ghetto or trash. Black people do not receive that very well.\u201d\n\nWhile Leakes admitted the comments she made online \u201cwere purely out of anger,\u201d she said she felt justified by statements Kim had previously made.\n\n\u201cDo I believe Kim is a racist? Some of the things she has said would definitely make you go, \u2018Hmmm,\u2019 \u201d Leakes said, as a montage of questionable moments of Kim\u2019s past time on the show played.\n\nImage zoom NeNe Leakes Alex Martinez/Bravo\n\nShe also stood by her attack of Brielle, 21 \u2014 who allegedly texted Leakes\u2019 son Brentt, 18, and invited herself over for the party, claiming she was in the neighborhood looking at her old house.\n\n\u201cI think Brielle is a beautiful girl. I\u2019ve known this girl from growing up. Your kid cannot talk to an adult using fowl language and expect me to say nothing back,\u201d Leakes said.\n\n\u201cThey really tried to do something to hurt me or discredit my home or how beautiful my home is. They wanted to discredit that,\u201d Leakes added. \u201cWhat she did was to mean and to be vicious and to be hateful. \u2026 It\u2019s heartbreaking. Why [Kim] couldn\u2019t just come in here and say she\u2019s happy for me? Why she couldn\u2019t just saying, \u2018I\u2019m happy for you girl. I\u2019m glad that you even accomplished a goal.\u2019 \u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim Zolciak-Biermann Alex Martinez/Bravo\n\nBut while Leakes said she felt attacked, Kim claimed she was the victim.\n\nThe mother of six claimed that after Leakes posted the video, she received death threats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to hire security. I\u2019ve had people come to the gate at my house,\u201d she told pal Shere\u00e9 Whitfield.\n\n\u201cShe wants to pull the race card. That\u2019s the devil, bitch,\u201d Kim said. \u201cShe spent so many years trying to sabotage my name and I just let it roll. Now you\u2019re f\u2014\u2014 with my kids? \u2018The whole family is racist, prejudice?\u2019 My whole family? There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. Not me, my husband, or my children see color. Never have.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shere\u00e9 Whitfield on the Status of NeNe Leakes & Kim Zolciak Biermann\u2019s Friendship: \u201cI\u2019m Not Sure They\u2019ll Ever Be Where They Were\u201d\n\nKim went on to explain that she sent Leakes a cease and desist, which she said cost her $20,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly. It\u2019s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann told E!\u2019s Daily Pop in October. \u201cThis is far beyond just having an opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,\u201d said that same month on Larry King Now. \u201cI\u2019m on a show with all African-American women and I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s ever been on the show that\u2019s Caucasian, so it\u2019s the card that sometimes they play and it\u2019s gross. And I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nLeakes\u2019 response to receiving the cease and desist? \u201cI burned it up with a lighter,\u201d she said Sunday.\n\nImage zoom NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak-Biermann Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images; Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nWhile it Kim was upset, she made it clear that she didn\u2019t regret sending the video in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt was a funny joke between Brielle and I. I\u2019m her mom. She can send me whatever the f\u2014 she wants,\u201d Kim told Kandi Burruss, saying once again that she wasn\u2019t racist. \u201cI don\u2019t have this kind of drama. NeNe has portrayed me saying dumb s\u2014. It\u2019s nasty. I just am who I am.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the whole cast seemed torn over who was right and who was wrong. But one thing was clear: it was going to take a lot to get these women back to the friendship they once had.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkim-zolciak1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes1-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/rhoa-kim-zolciak-biermann-got-death-threats-after-nene-leakes-called-her-a-racist/", "title": "RHOA: Kim Zolciak Received Death Threats After RoachGate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brielle Biermann,Kandi Burruss,Kim Zolciak Biermann,NeNe Leakes,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta,Sheree Whitfield,TV", "news_keywords": "Brielle Biermann,Kandi Burruss,Kim Zolciak Biermann,NeNe Leakes,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta,Sheree Whitfield,TV", "description": "The fallout from NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak-Biermann's #RoachGate feud consumed Sunday's all-new\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta", "og": {"title": "RHOA's Kim Zolciak Says She Received Death Threats After NeNe Leakes Called Her 'Racist'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/rhoa-kim-zolciak-biermann-got-death-threats-after-nene-leakes-called-her-a-racist/", "description": "The fallout from #RoachGate consumed Sunday\u2019s episode of&nbsp;Real Housewives of Atlanta,&nbsp;as&nbsp;NeNe Leakes&nbsp;called&nbsp;Kim Zolciak-Biermann&nbsp;and her daughter Brielle Biermann \u201cracist\u201d after they claimed she lived in a&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes1-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/rhoa-kim-zolciak-biermann-got-death-threats-after-nene-leakes-called-her-a-racist/", "description": "The fallout from NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak-Biermann's #RoachGate feud consumed Sunday's all-new\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes1-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/rhoa-kim-zolciak-biermann-got-death-threats-after-nene-leakes-called-her-a-racist/", "title": "RHOA's Kim Zolciak Says She Received Death Threats After NeNe Leakes Called Her 'Racist'", "description": "The fallout from NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak-Biermann's #RoachGate feud consumed Sunday's all-new\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-leakes1-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
