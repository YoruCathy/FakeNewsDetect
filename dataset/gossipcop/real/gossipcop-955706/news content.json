The official cast list for Star Wars: Episode IX has been posted, and it features some familiar, intriguing names. Along with the long-awaited return of Billy Dee Williams as Lando, Carrie Fisher is listed among the names.\n\nFisher sadly passed away in late-2016, of course, but Princess Leia Organa will be returning for one last film. Rather than recreating the character with CGI, however, director/co-writer J.J. Abrams will be resurfacing unseen footage from The Force Awakens.\n\n\u201cWe desperately loved Carrie Fisher,\u201d Abrams said in a press release tied to the announcement. \u201cFinding a truly satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga without her eluded us. We were never going to recast, or use a CG character. With the support and blessing from her daughter, [Billie Lourd], we have found a way to honor Carrie\u2019s legacy and role as Leia in Episode IX by using unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII.\u201d\n\nMeet the cast of Star Wars: Episode IX. Beginning filming next week.https://t.co/BUCl4H8aRT pic.twitter.com/ezEaLzijLq \u2014 Star Wars (@starwars) July 27, 2018\n\nRogue One, of course, took a slightly uncanny valley approach to recreating a young Leia with actress Ingvild Deila and a little bit of the old Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nAlso returning is Mark Hamill. Given how things worked out for him during The Last Jedi, however, it\u2019s hard to say if he\u2019ll be doing so as a translucent blue ghost. We\u2019ll have to wait until December 2019 to know for sure.\n\nCast members Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran and Joonas Suotamo will be returning, as well.", "images": ["https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-607402164.jpg?w=593", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-607402164.jpg?w=593", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Heater"], "canonical_link": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/27/star-wars-episode-ix-will-feature-unseen-footage-of-carrie-fisher-as-princess-leia/", "title": "Star Wars: Episode IX will feature unseen footage of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia \u2013 TechCrunch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.techcrunch.com", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-27 14:03:44", "sailthru.title": "Star Wars: Episode IX will feature unseen footage of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia", "sailthru.tags": "princess leia, star wars", "sailthru.author": "Brian Heater", "sailthru.description": "Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen The Last Jedi, though, if you still haven\u2019t at this point, what are you even doing reading casting announcements for the next one?
