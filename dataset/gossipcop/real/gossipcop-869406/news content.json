CHRIS WATTIE / Reuters\n\nRain or shine, when the little prince steps out in public, he sports a pair of adorable shorts, often paired with knee socks, a preppy striped belt and a tucked-in polo (yes, at age 4, young George is already more put together than most of us will ever be.)\n\nPrince William, Duchess Kate, Prince George and Princess Charlotte arrive in Victoria, Canada.

Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK did some investigating, and they found that dressing young boys in shorts is a long-standing tradition among the British royalty and aristocracy.\n\nStuff We Love Get a daily roundup of items that will make your life easier, healthier and more stylish.

Although times are (slowly) changing, a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class\u2013quite suburban. And no self-respecting aristo or royal would want to be considered suburban.\u201d\n\nMost boys graduate to full-length trousers at about 8 years old, Hanson explained. He said the shorts-only tradition may stem from the antiquated custom of \u201cbreeching,\u201d which dates back centuries in the U.K.\n\nTraditionally, he said, young British boys were dressed in gowns for the first few years of their lives, until being \u201cbreeched\u201d and graduating to short trousers.\n\nPrince George balances on a wooden swing at the family's Norfolk home in July 2016.
