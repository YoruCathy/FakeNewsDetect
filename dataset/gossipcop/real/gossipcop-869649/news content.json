They're also one of the hottest, but that goes without saying. Looking at them together is like staring into the sun.\n\nThe two haven't been shy about expressing their feelings for each other on social media, either. Parts of Rodriguez's Instagram page straight-up look like a Lopez fan account. He posted this photo of her standing and being opulent just because he could\u2014a true sign of his devotion.\n\nLopez's page is full of A-Rod love too: She meticulously documented the joint birthday party they threw together over the weekend\u2014their cake was bigger than both of them combined\u2014and here's a photo from Lopez's feed of them just cuddling (so serene, so blessed). It's beyond obvious these two are smitten:\n\nBut Lopez's latest message about Rodriguez blows all these other love notes out of the water. The \"On the Floor\" singer posted a photo of Rodriguez to Instagram last night in honor of his forty-second birthday, and the caption will make you weep. \"Happy Birthday to the man who makes my heart skip a beat every time he walks in the room... Wishing you the best year ever my love...so excited for everything God has in store for you... #thebestisyettocome #itsyourday #mimacho #amormio\u2764 #happybirthday #LEO #13,\" she wrote. See the post for yourself below.\n\nYou know love is real when you use the phrase \"My heart skips a beat.\" Can we also take a second to appreciate the amazing photo Lopez chose? Has anyone ever looked this serious holding a baseball? A-Rod has that whole \"wistful staring\" thing on lock. I'm completely transformed.\n\nRelationship goals, couple goals, staring goals, etc.\n\nRELATED: Alex Rodriguez Opens Up for the First Time About Dating Jennifer Lopez", "images": ["https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1499801854/glamour_we-asked-these-sisters-to-hug-for-4-minutes-straight.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/597a272c998c9d5afe0b6086/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JENNIFER-LOPEZ-ALEX-RODRIGUEZ.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/597a272c998c9d5afe0b6086/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/JENNIFER-LOPEZ-ALEX-RODRIGUEZ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/597a272c998c9d5afe0b6086/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JENNIFER-LOPEZ-ALEX-RODRIGUEZ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/jennifer-lopez-says-alex-rodriguez-makes-her-heart-skip-a-beat-in-new-instagram-post", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Says Alex Rodriguez Makes Her 'Heart Skip a Beat' in New Instagram Post", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Jennifer Lopez just said the sweetest thing about Alex Rodriguez on Instagram.
