Blair, who cooperated with the initial Los Angeles Times story on the condition her name not be used, said Toback threatened her life after their encounter, which she said took place in 1999. And in the nearly 20 years that followed, the actress only told two people about her experience.\n\n\u201cI still felt so powerless and scared,\u201d Blair said, describing her emotional state earlier this week. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018O.K., is there a big actress who is going to come out so that she can be the face of this? I want to bring as much awareness to this harassment as possible because I want Toback to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nToback denied the allegations to the Los Angeles Times, claiming that he had never met any of the then-38 accusers or, if he did, the meetings were very brief. He also claimed that for the last 22 years it had been \u201cbiologically impossible\u201d for him to do what he was accused of, citing diabetes and a heart condition.\n\n\u201cWhen he called these women liars, and said he didn\u2019t recall meeting them and that the behavior alleged could not be attributed to him, I just felt rage and an obligation to speak publicly now,\u201d Blair said.\n\n\u201cI did not want to talk about this ever again,\u201d McAdams said. \u201cHowever, even though it is a really bad memory, I feel like some good could come from talking about it now.\u201d\n\nWhat follow are edited excerpts from the actresses\u2019 conversations with Vanity Fair.\n\nSelma Blair\u2019s representatives arranged for her to meet Toback and described him as a \u201creally interesting and odd guy,\u201d who could help her gain credibility with the indie-film crowd. (She had filmed Cruel Intentions, but it had not yet been released.) Blair\u2019s team said Toback would only meet in his hotel room; Blair insisted that they meet in the hotel restaurant. The two were meant to discuss a project Toback had written called Harvard Man , so the actress dressed accordingly\u2014a pleated Y.S.L. skirt, a grosgrain ribbon, and a cable-knit sweater.\n\nThat afternoon, I arrived at the restaurant and sat down at a table. After a bit, the hostess came up to me and told me that James Toback could not make it down, but that he wanted me to meet him in his room. Against my better judgment, I went upstairs.\n\nI was rattled, and looking back, I don\u2019t think James Toback ever planned to come down to the restaurant.\n\nI went in the room feeling a little off balance about the arrangement, but he seemed nonplussed. He pulled out the script and said, \u201cI look at you, and I see that we have a real connection. You could be an incredible actress, just by your eyes. But I can tell you don\u2019t have confidence.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d\n\nI was thinking, \u201cWhy is he trying to make me feel so uncomfortable?\u201d But I realize now he was really trying to figure out what support system I had. I answered him. My mother was in Michigan, and I had an estranged relationship with my father.\n\nJames said, \u201cYou know, I could have him killed.\u201d\n\nHe sat back in his chair and said really confidently, \u201cI do it all the time. I know people.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m even more nervous, because he\u2019s told me I have no confidence, he said he could have someone killed, and he said we had a connection\u2014which no one had said to me before in this business. I really believed that when he started to talk . . . that he was going to be my mentor. That is how he got into my brain. You know, in acting classes they get into your personal history and connect that to work. So this conversation didn\u2019t seem that strange. It seemed like he was concerned that I would not be seen as the actress I had the potential to be, and that he could do for me what he did for Robert Downey Jr.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dec8d5034e986d4cd31532/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/All-the-women-who-have-accused-Harvey-Weinstein.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21a0320586235aaecf906/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Embed-Rachel-McAdams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59ef7eb6556f5850638b4765/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/James-Toback-Sexual-Assault-Accusations.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21d3b8f85857e9bf60831/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/l-Selma-Blair-Interview.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Krista Smith With Julie Miller", "Krista Smith With Julie Mille", "Yohana Dest", "Hillary Busi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/selma-blair-and-rachel-mcadams-share-their-stories-of-james-toback-sexual-harassment", "title": "Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams Share Their Stories of James Toback\u2019s Sexual Harassment", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Krista Smith with Julie Miller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Both women encountered the director early in their careers.
