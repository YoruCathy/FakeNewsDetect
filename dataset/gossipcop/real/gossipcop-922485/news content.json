For years, Farrow has claimed that Allen sexually abused her when she was a child. (Allen has denied the claims.) Numerous actresses\u2014Greta Gerwig, Rebecca Hall, Ellen Page, Rachel Brosnahan, Kate Winslet\u2014and actors\u2014Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2014who collaborated with Allen in the past have publicly spoken out against the director in recent months. But one actress, Allen\u2019s Oscar-winning Blue Jasmine leading lady Cate Blanchett, isn\u2019t quite as ready to step away. In a new interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Blanchett said that social media\u2014the birthplace of these hashtag social-justice movements\u2014is \u201cnot the judge and jury\u201d when it comes to Allen.\n\nIn the wake of the Time\u2019s Up movement, Dylan Farrow has been emboldened to share her story more publicly and more often, prompting journalists such as Amanpour to press former- and current-Allen collaborators for their take on the director. Amanpour questioned Blanchett, saying: \u201cHow do you juxtapose being a #MeToo proponent, a Time\u2019s Up proponent, and staying silent or having worked with Woody Allen?\u201d She also asked if Blanchett would work with Allen again, given the allegations. The actress responded:", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59160dfba6b3684517c81d7a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Cate-Blanchett-Style-Evo-ss15.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59160dfc6a23c8383c03ea60/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Cate-Blanchett-Style-Evo-ss13.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59160dfcd95e9642026115fa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Cate-Blanchett-Style-Evo-ss14.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/cate-blanchett-woody-allen-dylan-farrow-allegations", "title": "Cate Blanchett: Social Media Is \u201cNot the Judge and Jury\u201d of Woody Allen", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "\u201cIf these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they\u2019ve been through court, then I\u2019m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents,\u201d said the Blue Jasmine star.", "id": "5ab3f1b3d81411654dbdb6e2", "keywords": "movies,woody allen,cate blanchett,me too,time's up", "news_keywords": "movies,woody allen,cate blanchett,me too,time's up", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ab3f1b3d81411654dbdb6e2", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cIf these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they\u2019ve been through court, then I\u2019m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents,\u201d said the Blue Jasmine star.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cIf these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they\u2019ve been through court, then I\u2019m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents,\u201d said the Blue Jasmine star.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Cate Blanchett: Social Media Is \u201cNot the Judge and Jury\u201d of Woody Allen", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/cate-blanchett-woody-allen-dylan-farrow-allegations"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "\u201cIf these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they\u2019ve been through court, then I\u2019m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents,\u201d said the Blue Jasmine star.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab40ed5affa80574bdbb247/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cate-Blanchett.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Cate Blanchett: Social Media Is \u201cNot the Judge and Jury\u201d of Woody Allen"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
