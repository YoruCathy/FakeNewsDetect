But Middleton's net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.\n\nHere's everything we know about Middleton's net worth:\n\nWhat is Kate Middleton's net worth?\n\nThe 36 year-old mother of two \u2014 who is expecting her third royal baby by the end of April \u2014 is worth at least \u00a35 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as \u00a37.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton's wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn't have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.\n\nThat being said, Middleton's net worth is a lot less than her prince \u2014 Wealth-X estimates Prince William's net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William's wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal \u2014 an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.\n\nWhat do we know about Kate Middleton's money?\n\nMost of Middleton's net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around \u00a330 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.\n\nPrior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.\n\nGrowing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least \u00a3250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew's. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.\n\nHow did Kate Middleton's net worth change after marrying Prince William?\n\nJoining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.\n\nBefore Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth \u00a31 million, or $1.4 million.\n\nBut once Kate officially became a royal she didn't need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family's royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money \u2014 her net worth is believed to be about $5 million \u2014 as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5acce439146e7123008b4a98?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5acce45c87826b32008b4a7d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5c8fdfa469e11c1eb63c5036?width=150&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5acce5fd146e712c008b4a8e?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/kate-middleton-had-a-massive-fortune-heres-her-net-worth-2018-4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5acce439146e7123008b4a98?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5acce45c87826b32008b4a7d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alix Langone"], "canonical_link": "http://time.com/money/5224398/kate-middleton-net-worth/", "title": "Kate Middleton had a massive fortune before she became duchess \u2014 here's what we know about her net worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Kate Middleton had a massive fortune before she became duchess \u2014 here's what we know about her net worth", "date": "2018-04-10", "news_keywords": "Money.com, Kate Middleton, Net Worth, Alix Langone", "description": "Before marrying into the royal family, Kate Middleton was worth millions \u2014 and as Duchess of Cambridge, she's now part of a family worth billions.", "author": "Alix Langone", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Your Money Contributors", "og": {"title": "Kate Middleton had a massive fortune before she became duchess \u2014 here's what we know about her net worth", "description": "Before marrying into the royal family, Kate Middleton was worth millions \u2014 and as Duchess of Cambridge, she's now part of a family worth billions.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kate-middleton-had-a-massive-fortune-heres-her-net-worth-2018-4", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5acce45c87826b32008b4a7d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Kate Middleton had a massive fortune before she became duchess \u2014 here's what we know about her net worth", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-10", "sailthru.tags": "Money.com, Kate Middleton, Net Worth, Alix Langone", "sailthru.description": "Before marrying into the royal family, Kate Middleton was worth millions \u2014 and as Duchess of Cambridge, she's now part of a family worth billions.", "sailthru.author": "Alix Langone", "sailthru.verticals": "yourmoney-contributor, yourmoney, main-contributor", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5acce439146e7123008b4a98?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5acce439146e7123008b4a98?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bi_contributors"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "control", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "commerce-product-card-button-font": "variant2", "commerce-button": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "variant", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "5acce1df146e711c008b4797", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523289600.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
