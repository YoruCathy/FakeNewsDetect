The couple was not given permission to marry at the Church of England so they wed at Windsor Town Hall and were later blessed in St. George's Chapel, where Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle will tie the knot on May 19.\n\nThough the Queen eventually approved her son's marriage to Bowles, according to Bower she was still not keen on a big celebratory ceremony for their union.\n\nIn his book, the journalist claims that Queen nixed any plans for a big wedding reception, ending talks about a big 650-person affair.\n\nDistraught by the smaller scale wedding plans, Charles reportedly \"wallowed in gloom.\"\n\nSince the 2005 nuptials, Bowles has reportedly slowly grown on the Queen and can now be seen standing alongside the royal family at public events and during family outings.",
