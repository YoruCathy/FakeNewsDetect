Her happy place is Michaels craft store.\n\nHollywood actor Chris Evans is known for his portrayal of Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America, from the wildly popular Marvel movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Chris has no problem getting shirtless for many of his roles and showing off his killer six-pack, the actor admits that he doesn\u2019t find himself all that attractive!\n\nIn a recent interview with Thirst Aid Kit by BuzzFeed, Chris was asked to talk about the moment he realized he was hot. Instead of giving his answer, the actor surprisingly admitted he hasn\u2019t had that realization yet.\n\n\u201cI still feel like I\u2019m just trying to pull a fast one over on people,\u201d the actor replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I look like first thing in the morning. It\u2019s rough!\u201d\n\nThe action star went on to say that as a teen he had \u201ca really bumpy road\u201d in terms of how he looked. \u201cI think like most of us, we still feel like that no matter what,\u201d the 36-year-old actor explained. \u201cThat was probably one of the roughest chapters of my life. And so I think \u2014 for most people \u2014 you kind of stay in that suspended state.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Chris has been open and honest about struggles in his life. He recently sat down for an interview to discuss his anxiety and how that almost kept him from accepting the role of Captain America.
