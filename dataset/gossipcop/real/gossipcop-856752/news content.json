The move contradicted President Donald Trump\u2019s old criticism of former First Lady Michelle Obama for making a similar decision.\n\nObama opted not to wear a headscarf in Saudi Arabia in 2015, but she wore a black veil and a black dress when she met Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican in 2009.\n\nWhile the dress code for papal audiences has received a good deal of attention, it\u2019s possible Pope Francis has taken a more relaxed approach in recent years.\n\n\u201cThings have become more relaxed over the last few years. There are no hard and fast rules,\u201d a spokesperson for the Vatican told The Telegraph last month, after Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, wore a champagne-colored dress and no veil while meeting the Pope at the Vatican.\n\nGet our Politics Newsletter.
