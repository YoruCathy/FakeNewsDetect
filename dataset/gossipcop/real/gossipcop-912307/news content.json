Richard Pryor\u2019s widow Jennifer Pryor first tweeted, and then confirmed to TMZ that her husband did, indeed, have a sexual relationship with Marlon Brando, as Jones claimed in his interview. Pryor\u2019s tweet read, \u201cHey girl: It was the 70's: enough cocaine and good music-one could fuck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning! # noshame\u201c\n\nIvanka Trump still has yet to comment. The original story continues below.\n\nQuincy Jones used to date Ivanka Trump\u2014or so he says. In a wide-ranging interview with New York magazine\u2019s David Marchese, the music producer casually mentioned, as an aside, that he went on a date with the First Daughter about 12 years ago. Marchese didn\u2019t let that one go.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a crazy motherfucker,\u201d Jones, now 84, said of Donald Trump. \u201cLimited mentally\u2014a megalomaniac, narcissistic. I can\u2019t stand him. I used to date Ivanka, you know.\u201d\n\nMarchese responded with apparent shock at the new information: \u201cWait, really?\u201d Back to Jones, who said that 12 years ago, Tommy Hilfiger, who was working with his daughter Kidada, a former model and current designer, told Jones that Ivanka wanted to have dinner with him.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No problem,\u2019\u201d Jones recalled. \u201c\u2018She\u2019s a fine motherfucker.\u2019 She had the most beautiful legs I ever saw in my life. Wrong father, though.\u201d\n\nIf Jones\u2019s 12-year time stamp is right, that would put his date (he only references one) with Ivanka in 2006, the same year she turned 25 and celebrated alongside actor and then That 70s Show star Topher Grace. It was around this time that Ivanka was rumored to be going on dates with Lance Armstrong. She denied that there was any romance there.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for Lance and all he has accomplished,\u201d she told People. \u201cThat said, we are just friends.\u201d\n\nShe has not publicly commented on any date with Jones, neither at the time nor since the New York interview was published.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a3457958ae8fd2b3a999bf1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ivanka-Trump-Year-in-Pink-SS04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7b360bde9b09113f1369a2/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Ivanka-Trump-Dated-Quincy-Jones.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a3457949781ed4490fc3787/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ivanka-Trump-Year-in-Pink-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a79ca90e270fe74de68e6da/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ivanka-trump-winter-olympics.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a57a4b8602b5c7de0eb7d65/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ivanka-trump-birthday-instagram.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a3457969781ed4490fc3789/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ivanka-Trump-Year-in-Pink-SS05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7b360bde9b09113f1369a2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ivanka-Trump-Dated-Quincy-Jones.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7b360bde9b09113f1369a2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ivanka-Trump-Dated-Quincy-Jones.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Weaver", "Hilary Weave", "Kenzie Bryan", "Erika Harwoo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/quincy-jones-claims-he-dated-ivanka-trump-12-years-ago", "title": "Quincy Jones Claims He Dated Ivanka Trump 12 Years Ago", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hilary Weaver", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "\u201cShe\u2019s a fine motherf---er.
