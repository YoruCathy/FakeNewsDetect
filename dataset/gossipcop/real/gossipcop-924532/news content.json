The Queen of Tejano left a permanent mark on the world, especially on her husband Chris Perez.\n\nMore from Mam\u00e1sLatinas: These old pics of Selena Quintanilla & Chris Perez are total #Relationshipgoals\n\nThe couple was so in love that they secretly eloped despite the fact that Selena's father disapproved of their relationship, and remained joined at the hip until she was murdered on March 31, 1995. This is why it should come as no surprise that, even though all of this time has passed, Perez is still grieving her loss. The heartbreaking message he posted on social media on the 23rd anniversary of her death is all of the proof we need.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=550127928784997&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn-ugc.mamaslatinas.com/gen/constrain/600/600/80/2018/04/02/12/3a/xa/pohg615zs4.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/730/5000/70/2018/04/02/13/3z/ht/phrwr014o41.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2012/10/11/15/jh/rz/phtmvswg841.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035453&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_wn=e1_4", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bnzfTM78T_ems.gif", "https://bcp.crwdcntrl.net/5/c=9173/b=54110645", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2020/04/17/12/da/tv/phvyqgq08o1.jpg", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2617628820649&event=pagevisit&noscript=1", "https://cdn-ugc.mamaslatinas.com/gen/crop/640/359/80/2018/04/02/12/3a/xa/pohg615zs4.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2020/04/18/10/dp/5j/ph3bwu5ts01.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2020/04/17/16/ai/kr/ph4scgli8g1.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2016/08/05/16/2n/v0/podj3ro5s0.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/full/2018/04/02/15/dd/uz/phpctewxwk1.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2013/03/20/16/5h/on/phzy7wc9gc1.jpg", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2617628820649&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/full/2018/04/02/15/dd/uz/phpctewxwk1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cindy Diaz"], "canonical_link": "http://quemas.mamaslatinas.com/entertainment/151909/chris-perez-remembers-selena-quintanilla-on-the-23rd-anniversary-of-her-death-and-its-clear-hes-not-over-her", "title": "Chris Perez remembers Selena Quintanilla on the 23rd anniversary of her death & it's clear he's not over her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=0,maximum-scale=1.0", "google": "notranslate", "description": "Chris Perez remembers Selena Quintanilla on the 23rd anniversary of her death on social media.
