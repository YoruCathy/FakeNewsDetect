Teri didn\u2019t. There was no bad blood, I think that was just the way it was.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Teri Hatcher Is Desperate For A \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Revival\n\nDuring the same interview, Longoria also denied that her friendship with former \u201cHousewives\u201d co-star Nicollette Sheridan was impacted when she sued series creator Marc Cherry in a high-profile wrongful-termination lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe were pretty removed from the court case,\u201d added Longoria. \u201cBut Nicollette is great, she is a great girl. She\u2019s just a fun girl to hang out with.\u201d", "images": ["https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/elton.png?w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC041820AJRBandTalksReturnAPTN.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/149178_1844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/pride-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen-shot-2020-04-18-at-9.57.39-pm.png?w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/ev6vhlxuyaa1odb.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/GlobalTV/GLOB0056333400000000/GLOB0056333400000011_1_thumbnail.jpeg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen-shot-2020-04-18-at-9.31.38-pm.png?crop=18px%2C0px%2C495px%2C331px&resize=145%2C97&quality=80&strip=all", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/WNG_0318_042320_Finale%20First%20Look_Rev2_h264_hd.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/116837_0053b.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC041820ChrisODowdTalksHereWeAreAPTN.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_6.53.14_pm.png?w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/4086b526c42e4ccfd087129943b18bc3.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_2.31.52_pm.png?w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/21545382.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/country-club-web-brick-340x150b.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/GlobalTV/GLOB0056102040000000/GLOB0056102040000011_1_thumbnail.jpeg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/149178_1844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Furdyk"], "canonical_link": "http://etcanada.com/news/317711/eva-longoria-is-still-friends-with-her-desperate-housewives-co-stars-with-one-exception/", "title": "Eva Longoria Is Still Friends With Her \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Co-Stars \u2014 With One Exception", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Eva Longoria Is Still Friends With Her \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Co-Stars \u2014\u00a0With One\u00a0Exception", "author": "Brent Furdyk", "description": "Rumours of friction among the cast of \"Desperate Housewives\" were rampant throughout the series' eight-season run, and according to one of the show's stars, those rumours\u00a0had a bit of truth to them.
