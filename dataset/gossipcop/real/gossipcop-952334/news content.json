They hopped in a truck and took the long drive to see the house, and Cutler promised they could have a herd of goats if it would seal the deal.\n\n\u201cWhat if there are goats there already? Are we in? Because I need to make a call then. Release the goats, please.\u201d\n\nWith the sports schedule entering the annual summer drought, Very Cavallari is one of the best viewing options on Sunday night.", "images": ["https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/jay1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-ftw.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen-shot-2020-04-17-at-1.18.06-pm.jpg?w=100&h=57&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/travelerschamp.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/extraction-behind-the-scenes.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/nick1.jpg?w=48&h=48&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-usat-bar.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/jay1.jpg?w=1000&h=600&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ftw-icon-section-head.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gty-953867756.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tuatagovailoa.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/libertyno1.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/455101536_72969818-e1530624017887.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/tua.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen-shot-2020-04-17-at-4.40.03-pm.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/fifa.png?w=34&h=20&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/jay1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Schwartz", "Andy Nesbitt", "July"], "canonical_link": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/kristin-cavallari-very-cavallari-jay-cutler-new-house-goats", "title": "Watch Jay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari argue over house hunting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Jay Cutler really wants to move.", "keywords": "jay cutler, kristin cavallari, very cavallari, jay cutler wife, cavallari, jay cutler house,", "fb": {"app_id": 451360081611296, "admins": 1651440013}, "google-site-verification": "no3A69hVM5ut63_reMWqC5VegUmDtCMsgeO4Wh_iBY8", "msvalidate.01": "6C7AFE373C691E833D6444FFA7F6E8A2", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Watch Jay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari argue over house hunting", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/kristin-cavallari-very-cavallari-jay-cutler-new-house-goats", "description": "Jay Cutler really wants to move.", "site_name": "For The Win", "image": {"identifier": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/jay1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-18T15:20:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-18T15:25:19+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usatodayftw", "author": "https://facebook.com/schwartznick"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@ForTheWin", "site": "@forthewin", "text": {"title": "Watch Jay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari argue over house hunting"}, "image": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/jay1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gdpr": "false", "sop-property": "581b62d42a2cc300124a6a6e", "application-name": "For The Win", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "What fans are talking about.", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://ftw.usatoday.com/feed;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/2ef498b87825ac1e90fb08b478c63932?s=16"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/2N9vkqnr4tA?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOtqlAsy0Z0?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1531927229.0, "source": "https://ftw.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
