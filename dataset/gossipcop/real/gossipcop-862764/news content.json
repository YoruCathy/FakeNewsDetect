And it also affects married men.\u201d\n\nWyatt\u2019s reference to married men is a nod to the primary argument made by Cosby\u2019s defense attorney Brian McMonagle, that Cosby was a man who had been unfaithful to his wife, but not a perpetrator of sexual assault, as accuser Andrea Constand had testified. Added Ebonee Benson, a spokeswoman for Camille Cosby, \u201cLaws are changing, the statute of limitations for victims of sexual assault are being extended, so this is why people need to be educated on \u2026 a brush against the shoulder. Anything at this point can be considered sexual assault. It\u2019s a good thing to be educated about the laws.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, Wyatt issued a statement to Rolling Stone confirming the town halls \u2013 and suggesting that he\u2019s hoping they will expose the larger forces at play in Cosby\u2019s trial.\n\n\u201cMy Associate Ebonee Benson and I received hundreds of calls from civic organizations and churches requesting for Mr. Cosby to speak to young men and women about the judicial system,\u201d Wyatt tells Rolling Stone. \u201cThey feel that the young men and women need to be aware that Mr. Cosby was given a deal to never be criminally charged by Former DA Bruce Castor and 12 years later DA Kevin Steele runs a Willie Horton style campaign ad saying, \u2018If you elect me I will bring Bill Cosby to justice.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThese groups would like for Mr. Cosby to share that people in the judicial system can use their powers to annul deals for personal agenda and political ambitions,\u201d he adds. \u201cSpeeches will be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can educate themselves on the situation that they\u2019re facing today,\u201d Wyatt tells Rolling Stone of the planned events. \u201cLaws are changing. Statute of limitations are being amended. It\u2019s important to educate people that you could be at a baseball game and it could be crowded and a young man could try to squeeze through and accidentally touch a young lady\u2019s butt or breast by mistake and that could be considered sexual assault. It\u2019s imperative that we educate people that want to be educated.\u201d\n\nFollowing the mistrial ruling, Steele announced he would retry Cosby within 120 days. While Wyatt admits that \u201cour legal team will be going through everything he\u2019s going to say,\u201d he claims his team will not vet audience questions ahead of time, ostensibly allowing both supporters and detractors from questioning the comedian. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to say anything to jeopardize the [upcoming] trial or put himself in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Wyatt says. \u201cThere are going to be some questions he won\u2019t be able to answer.\u201d\n\nThe genesis of the planned town halls, says Wyatt, came from requests from various church and civic organizations, though he declined to provide any specific groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, an anonymous juror told ABC News that the jury was deadlocked after 52 hours of deliberation because of two jurors who believed Cosby should be acquitted. \u201cThere was no budging,\u201d after the first deadlock, the juror said, \u201cand there was none from there on out.\u201d\n\nA second juror spoke to The Associated Press Thursday, saying that the jury was actually more evenly split with a similar number of jurors wanting to convict Cosby as wanted to acquit him.\n\nThe second juror told the AP it was suspicious that the three charges of sexual misconduct were brought about, though \u201cno new evidence from \u201905 to now has showed up, no stained clothing, no smoking gun, nothing.\u201d They added that other jurors similarly expressed the view that \u201cpolitics was involved.\u201d\n\nWith any public event for a figure as polarizing as Cosby, the actor risks facing highly visible protests and scrutiny. \u201cPeople have a right to protest,\u201d says Wyatt. \u201cWe just ask that our supporters be respectful and not engage or incite anything \u2026 He has been consistent that people respect each other. He has used his entire career to humanize all age groups, races, genders and religious groups and he\u2019ll continue to do that as he moves on with his life.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Jason
