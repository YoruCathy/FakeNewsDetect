A lot of anticipation, not much promise.\u201d\n\nAngry Mel \u2014 who debuted new white hair for the evening \u2014 poured her mug of water all over Cowell before leaving the panel.\n\nHost Tyra Banks said: \u201cMel B is out. This is live TV, all. Live TV,\u201d while judge Howie Mandel added: \u201cSomething just went wrong.\u201d\n\nDespite the drama, Mel, 43, eventually returned for the remainder of the show but appeared to have ripped her dress in the process.\n\nMel filed for divorce from Belafonte earlier this year and was granted a restraining order against him after she accused him of abusing her, getting their nanny pregnant and forcing her to take part in threesomes.\n\nThe star has three daughters \u2014 5-year-old Madison with Stephen, Phoenix, 18, from her first marriage to Jimmy Gulzar, and Angel, 10, from a relationship with Eddie Murphy \u2014 and she and Belafonte are locked in a custody battle.\n\nA judge recently ruled that Belafonte can apply for custody rights to his stepdaughter Angel after he argued he played a significant role in raising her and is eager to be able to retain contact with her in the future.\n\nAt a hearing in Los Angeles, Judge Lawrence Riff said: \u201cMr. Belafonte claims it\u2019s in the child\u2019s best interests for him to have contact, frequent and continuing, with the child he says he raised from an infant. The petitioner says it is clearly not in that child\u2019s interest. Those are the assertions.\u201d\n\nAn insider said the 42-year-old producer \u2014 who has monitored visitation with Madison \u2014 was delighted with the ruling.\n\nThe source explained: \u201cHe has raised Angel as his own. He\u2019s the only father she has ever known. God knows what this poor child is thinking. Stephen is looking forward to the day he can see both girls together. His kids are all that matter to him.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/the-sun_logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=84", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tv_americas_got_talent.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tv_americas_got_talent.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fay Strang", "The Sun", "August"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4302425/mel-b-looks-dramatically-different-as-she-debuts-her-new-white-hair-at-americas-got-talent-filming-before-throwing-a-glass-of-water-at-simon-cowell-after-he-mocks-her-marriage-drama/", "title": "Mel B walks off \u2018AGT\u2019 after Simon jokes about her wedding night", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
