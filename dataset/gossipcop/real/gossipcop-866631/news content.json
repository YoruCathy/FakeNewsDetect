In 2009 he released Behind The Bell, his point-of-view from his SBTB days, featuring some very unflattering stories about his former friends. Around Christmas in 2014, he got into a bar fight and apparently stabbed someone. In June of 2015, he was sentenced to 4 months in jail for this incident.\n\nMara Wilson Mara Wilson played the bright, supernaturally gifted and often mistreated title character in \u2018Matilda.\u2019 Wilson was already an established actress at the time of the film\u2019s release, having starred in \u2018Miracle on 34th Street\u2019 and \u2018Mrs. Doubtfire.\u2019 Wilson\u2019s last mainstream role was 2000\u2019s \u2018Thomas and the Magic Railroad.\u2019 She graduated from New York University in 2009 and has stated she stopped acting.
