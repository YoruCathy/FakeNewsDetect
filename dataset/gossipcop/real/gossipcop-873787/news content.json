While working as a respiratory therapist in the ICU, caring for critically ill patients, Danielle was driven to live her own life to the fullest and turned her passion for photography into a career. Today, Danielle works for Hasbro, shooting both lifestyle and product imagery that captures the joy and excitement of play and kids infinate imaginations. She believes that dreaming big means, \u201cnever discounting your ideas as crazy, but instead finding ways to make them real because you wholeheartedly believe that your best adventure hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d Danielle says there\u2019s one princess she relates to the most. \u201c[Mulan] grew up in a place where there were certain traditions that no one dared to deviate from. I grew up in a town that was very isolated where most everyone was coming from one similar perspective. We both had to push ourselves beyond what was considered to be normal based on our upbringing to learn about what is out there in the world in order to discover who we truly are.\u201d Explaining further why she feels so inspired by the brave princess, she says, \u201cMulan is such a great example of a woman who ran with a crazy idea without worrying about what others might think. She completely defied tradition, obstacles and gender stereotypes to stand up for what she believed in. Mulan didn\u2019t even considering letting doubt get the best of her. Instead she instantly got to work putting her ideas into action.\u201d", "images": ["https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/screen_shot_2017-08-15_at_11_bf31cc54.png?region=0%2C0%2C518%2C420", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/mayumirui_3d735189.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/theresa_b387c744.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/laurazalenga_c76ff01c.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/image_dce3649d_18e1160a.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C800%2C800", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/anniegriffiths_b810d158.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/ronitcohen_e6ff051b.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/h_disneyprincess_dreambigprincessugc2017_7258ab10.png?region=0,0,2048,356", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/ashimanarain_e901deff.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/dilanbozyel_0e115505.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/luisa_08ba415d.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/megschwartz_0472691a.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/danisykes_c3ec670d.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/margarita_7d905bfb.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/calliope_576f588f.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/lululiao_b38366f5.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/scarletpage_90e9c4e9.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/christinamittermeier_eabcb830.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/banan_12ec1dc9.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/amivitale_c203d212.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352", "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/kateparker_01a25d60.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C424%2C352"], "top_img": "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/image_dce3649d_18e1160a.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C800%2C800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://partners.disney.com/dream-big-princess-bios", "title": "Dream Big Princess Photography Campaign", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "no_follow": "false", "no_index": "false", "og": {"title": "Dream Big Princess Photography Campaign - Disney Partners", "type": "website", "site_name": "Dream Big Princess Photography Campaign | Disney Partners", "url": "https://partners.disney.com/dream-big-princess-bios", "image": "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/image_dce3649d_18e1160a.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C800%2C800"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://partners.disney.com", "summary": ""}
