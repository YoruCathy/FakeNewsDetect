She must report to prison in 45 days.\n\nMiller was indicted on fraud charges in 2015 for allegedly hiding from a bankruptcy court $775,000 in income she earned after filing a petition to reorganize her Pittsburgh dance studio in 2010.\n\nLast June, she pleaded guilty to purposely hiding that income. She also pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge of sneaking $120,000 in foreign currency into the United States from Australia, which, according to The Associated Press, she agreed to forfeit.\n\nProsecutors wanted Miller to spend 2.5 years in prison, while her attorneys were hoping for probation because all of her creditors were made whole after the fraud was discovered.\n\nMiller was known for her strong personality and fiery interactions with her students and their parents before quitting the Lifetime reality show in March. She later said she stepped away from the show because it had taken a toll on her mental health after years of \"being manipulated, disrespected, and used day in and day out by men.\"\n\nLifetime, which declined to comment on Miller's departure, has kept the show going with guest choreographers, including former \"Dancing With the Stars\" pro Cheryl Burke.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP-Abbey-Lee-Miller-rc-170509_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP-Abbey-Lee-Miller-rc-170509_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Luchina Fisher", "May", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/abby-lee-miller-sentenced-year-day-prison/story?id=47298382", "title": "Abby Lee Miller sentenced to a year and a day in prison", "meta_data": {"description": "Former \"Dance Moms\" reality star sentenced to federal prison in fraud case.", "keywords": "abby lee miller", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
