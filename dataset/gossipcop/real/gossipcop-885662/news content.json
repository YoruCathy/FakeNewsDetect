The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.\n\nOne thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.\n\nThe behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c339f7f210000e109caeadf.jpeg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db5f9d2d000097173094f9.jpeg?cache=wkwckstu6c&ops=crop_0_103_2303_1226,scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ddd477140000a6234942ee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db5f9d2d000097173094f9.jpeg?cache=wkwckstu6c&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db5f9d2d000097173094f9.jpeg?cache=wkwckstu6c&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Freelance Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/meryl-streep-harvey-weinstein_n_59db5d87e4b072637c45420e", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Meryl Streep Speaks Out Against Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "She said the women who have spoken out against him are \"heroes.\"", "keywords": "Celebrities,Sex Crimes,Movie Awards,harvey weinstein,Meryl Streep,The Weinstein Company", "og": {"title": "EXCLUSIVE: Meryl Streep Speaks Out Against Harvey Weinstein", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db5f9d2d000097173094f9.jpeg?cache=wkwckstu6c&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db5f9d2d000097173094f9.jpeg?cache=wkwckstu6c&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/meryl-streep-harvey-weinstein_n_59db5d87e4b072637c45420e", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "She said the women who have spoken out against him are \"heroes.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,Sex Crimes,Movie Awards,harvey weinstein,Meryl Streep,The Weinstein Company", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-09 08:15:58 -0400", "modified_time": "2019-04-10 13:19:51 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Meryl Streep Speaks Out Against Harvey Weinstein", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59db5f9d2d000097173094f9.jpeg?cache=wkwckstu6c&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "She said the women who have spoken out against him are \"heroes.\""}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59db5d87e4b072637c45420e", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507551358.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
