Styles appeared briefly disturbed by it and quickly swatted away the person\u2019s hand, continuing his performance, but a moment later as he headed back towards the opposite edge of the stage, he covered his groin with his hand, clearly not willing to get grabbed for a second time.\n\nWTF!!! When your favorite artist is close to you, this does not justify you touching him in this way. #RespectHarry pic.twitter.com/0PdUGR6nN2 \u2014 \u064b (@___VXXIIS) October 22, 2017\n\n\u201cYou can tell it freaked him out a little because as he continued performing, he avoided the section that fan was standing in,\u201d an eyewitness told Yahoo Celebrity UK.\n\nThe hashtag #RespectHarry quickly trended on Twitter after the encounter, with fans taking to social media to express their opinions and condemn the phantom groper.\n\n\u201cHarry deserves appreciation, support and respect from us. Harry is not an object, he is a human, you should always remember that. Treat ALL people with kindness AND respect,\u201d one wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is a prime example that men are not the only ones that touch women without permission! Women also sexually assault,\u201d another person tweeted.\n\n\u201cIf you grab someone\u2019s dick without their consent, it\u2019s sexual assault,\u201d one fan commented. \u201cJust because Harry\u2019s a male doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have the same right as women. You must be absolutely disgusting if you think him kneeling in front of you calls for that. I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine waking up today knowing you sexually assaulted & disrespected the sweetest man on Earth,\u201d another shared.\n\nSome fans also shared a video of a fan at a concert simply touching Styles\u2019 shoe with her index finger as he stood on the stage in front of her. \u201cI mean why couldn\u2019t she be like this girl instead of doing something so disrespectful?\u201d another fan asked.\n\nThe incident happened in a week when the #MeToo hashtag trended on social media, with people sharing their stories of sexual harassment and assault in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex scandal. The disgraced Hollywood producer is being investigated by police in London and New York City after several women came forward with claims of Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-865099324-copy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-865099324-copy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-865099324-copy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/harry-styles-is-groped-onstage-by-fan-twitter-reacts/", "title": "Harry Styles Is Groped Onstage by Fan, Twitter Reacts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Harry Styles was groped onstage by a fan during a performance in L.A. on Saturday, October 22, and Twitter wasn\u2019t having it \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Harry Styles Is Groped Onstage by Fan, Twitter Reacts", "description": "Harry Styles was groped onstage by a fan during a performance in L.A. on Saturday, October 22, and Twitter wasn\u2019t having it \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/harry-styles-is-groped-onstage-by-fan-twitter-reacts/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:23:27+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-865099324-copy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-865099324-copy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-10-22T22:11:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:23:27+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Harry Styles was groped onstage by a fan during a performance in L.A. on Saturday, October 22, and Twitter wasn\u2019t having it \u2014 read more", "title": "Harry Styles Is Groped Onstage by Fan, Twitter Reacts", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-865099324-copy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508710311.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
