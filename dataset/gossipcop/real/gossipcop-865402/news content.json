To mark the first year of happily wedded bliss, the Grammy-winning singer took to the heavens (really!) to profess her love for the NFL player on Thursday, July 6.\n\nThe sweet gesture was planned while the two enjoyed a romantic getaway this week in Mexico. Ciara, 31, posted a photo of a custom banner waving above the sea, and wrote on Instagram: \u201cHappy 1 Year Baby. Yay! I [heart] you. I\u2019m Grateful to God for the Love he has given me, by putting you in my life. I have all that I need. Truly 1 of the Best years of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHAPPY 1 YEAR BABY! YAY!

The already-sentimental moment was even sweeter when Future attempted to read the banner. \u201cDo you see it? Mommy put a cool sign up in the sky,\u201d Wilson, 28, says in the video. \u201cSo cool. We made it\u2026 one year!\u201d\n\nHappy 1 Year Anniversary @DangeRussWilson! 1 Year Down\u2026 #ForeverTogether \u2764\ufe0f A post shared by Ciara (@ciara) on Jul 6, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT\n\nMany notable guests made their way to the U.K. for Ciara and Wilson\u2019s destination wedding, including Kelly Rowland and Jennifer Hudson. \u201cIt was honestly so beautiful and I really felt like I was in a fairy tale,\u201d the \u201c1, 2 Step\u201d singer told #Legend magazine in an October 2016 interview. \u201cIt was everything I hoped for. Everything I could have hoped for, dreamed of, happened on that day. It was memorable. I\u2019m definitely still floating.\u201d\n\nThe bride\u2019s custom Peter Dundas was the wedding gown she had dreamed of. \u201cIt was my dream dress,\u201d she told the mag. \u201cMy dress, everything, my family and friends that were there, the man I was marrying, everything was absolutely a dream come true.\u201d\n\nThe singer says that family life has grounded her. \u201cMotherhood, oh my gosh, it\u2019s one of the best jobs in life,\u201d she concluded. \u201cMy family, my son, and my husband, those are the things that keep me grounded and centered, and there\u2019s no better feeling than coming back and seeing him smile after a long day.\u201d", "images": ["https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cec381d2-93e9-4201-9271-30f51f4fec94~rs_200.h", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/authors/kspears-2.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ciara-Russell-Wilson-Anniversary-1500.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-the-knot-news-logo@2x.png", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brittany-Tyler-Couch-Story-Lead-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Questions-About-How-Coronavirus-Could-Affect-Your-Wedding_-Read-This-LEAD-shutterstock-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2127-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89960078_664744544273850_2656838980867194880_o-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1554396644-120x67.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ciara-Russell-Wilson-Anniversary-1500.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelly Is An Online News Writer For The Knot.
