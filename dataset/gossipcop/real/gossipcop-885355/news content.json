During the TCA winter press tour in January, ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about an eighth season, pending a meeting with Kitsis and Horowitz, but that was not to be.\n\n\u201cWhen we first heard Adam and Eddy\u2019s pitch for Once Upon a Time, we knew it was something incredibly special,\u201d Dungey said in a statement today. \u201cFor seven years, they have captivated us with their creativity and passion while reimagining some of our most beloved Disney fairytales, creating an undeniable global hit. Saying goodbye will be bittersweet, but Once Upon a Time\u2019 will forever be part of the ABC legacy and we can\u2019t wait for fans to join us in this epic final chapter.\u201d\n\nOnce Upon a Time was a breakout hit when it premiered in fall 2011, starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle and Jared Gilmore, and featuring classic Disney fairytale characters. In addition to strong ratings early in its run, Once fit nicely in the Disney brand with corporate synergies and has been a solid international seller for producer ABC Studios because of the global recognition of its characters.\n\n\u201c\u2019Once Upon a Time has been an amazing journey for all of us at ABC Studios and for fans around the world,\u201d said Patrick Moran, president of ABC Studios. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud and appreciative of the hard work and creative talent that Eddy Kitsis, Adam Horowitz and their cast and crew brought to this show for seven magical seasons.\u201d\n\nOnce Upon a Time\u2019s ratings had been declining for the past few seasons and further dropped when the show moved from Sunday to Friday this past fall. The series, whose Season 7 reboot was met by mixed reaction by fans, currently stars Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle, Colin O\u2019Donoghue, Andrew J. West, Gabrielle Anwar, Dania Ramirez, Alison Fernandez and Mekia Cox. Steve Pearlman and David H. Goodman also are executive producing.\n\n\u201cSeven years ago, we set out to create a show about hope, where even in the darkest of times, a happy ending would always be possible,\u201d said Once creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. \u201d But we never imagined the happy ending that was actually in store for all of us \u2014 years and years of adventure, romance, magic and hope. We\u2019re so grateful to our brilliant collaborators \u2013 the cast, crew, and writers \u2014 as well as our partners at the studio and network for making this journey possible.
