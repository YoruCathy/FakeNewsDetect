Career wise and health wise. Stop coming for me and my team when I\u2019ve never been better literally in any department.

I\u2019m prolly gonna post on der for a little while and take a breather from Twitter and [Instagram] for a little. Just sometimes can\u2019t help but bump into some negative sh*t that really can bum u out and it\u2019s not worth it honestly,\" replied Grande, who also turned off comments on her Instagram account. \"Promised I\u2019d always tell you.

On Tuesday morning, Grande tweeted about her excitement over her upcoming album, Sweetener, and posted a message of love to her fans. She also posted a selfie to Instagram.\n\ntwenty four days \u2014 Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) July 24, 2018\n\nlove u \u2014 Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) July 24, 2018\n\nThe singer's announcement on Monday came just a few hours after Davidson deleted all of the posts from his Instagram account. When fans expressed concern that the move meant there was trouble with the newly engaged pair, the 24-year-old Saturday Night Live star was quick to address the speculation.\n\nInstagram Stories\n\n\"No, there's nothing wrong. No nothing happened,\" Davidson wrote on his Instagram Story. \"No, there's nothing cryptic about anything. I just don't wanna be on Instagram anymore, or on any social media platform.\"\n\n\"The Internet is an evil place and it doesn't make me feel good,\" he continued. \"Why should I spend any time on negative energy when my real life is f**king lit? The fact that I even have to say this proves my point. I love you all and I'm sure I'll be back at some point. Your neighborhood goon, Pete.\"\n\nHere's more on the couple:\n\nAriana Grande and Pete Davidson's Most Adorable Moments (So Far)!
