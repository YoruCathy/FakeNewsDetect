Winslet will be playing a character named \u201cRonal\u201d and it\u2019s unclear yet how many of the four planned sequels she will appear in or whether she\u2019ll even be human or Na\u2019vi. Well, at least we can all be sure Cameron knows how to shoot the Oscar winner in blue.\n\nWhen breaking the news, Cameron told Deadline: \u201cKate and I have been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on Titanic, which was one of the most rewarding of my career.\u201d But as any Winslet lover can tell you, their decades-long relationship hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth sailing. In 1998, when Winslet was making the press rounds for her Oscar-nominated work in Titanic (her second nomination after 1995\u2019s Sense and Sensibility) she famously told the L.A. Times: \u201cI would only work for Jim Cameron again for a lot of money.\u201d Winslet later told Rolling Stone that quote was misinterpreted, but even that magazine added that Winslet \u201crelated harrowing near-drownings, and lots and lots of yelling\u201d courtesy of her director.\n\nWhen asked in 2012 about Winslet\u2019s occasional Titanic complaints to the press, James Cameron told Moviefone: \u201cI have to cut her some slack on that . . . a good part of the success of the film was because of their great work and so now they\u2019ve had this sort of sense that there was a long shadow they had to escape from, so I understand her needing to distance herself from it. But, on the other hand, you know, it\u2019s been 16 years, like, come on, Kate. Get over it. Take the win, girl! [Laughs] It\u2019s O.K. You can relax now. You can unclench . . . I said I understood [her] response, I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with it.\u201d\n\nAnd that same year, when Winslet and Cameron walked the red carpet together at the premiere of Titanic\u2019s 3-D re-release in theaters, Winslet was eager to defend Cameron against reports that he had bullied her on the set. \u201cYes, he lost his temper,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut he only ever lost his temper for really, really good reasons.\u201d Winslet and Cameron have both said it was the actress\u2019s relationship with co-star (and lifelong friend) Leonardo DiCaprio that got her through the very rough shoot. \u201cDid Kate mention that they were really there for each other?\u201d Cameron told Rolling Stone in \u201998. \u201cOn a long shoot, especially as you get into, like, month five, you\u2019re just in a siege.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg",
