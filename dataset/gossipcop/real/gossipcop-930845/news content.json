The Saturday Night Live star recently wed her longtime love, Conner O\u2019Malley.\n\nBryant, 30, shared the news on Monday, April 30, via Instagram.\n\n\u201c\ud83d\udc95,\u201d she simply wrote alongside a photo of herself walking down the aisle with her new husband.\n\nThe I Feel Pretty actress announced during an April 2017 appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers that she was engaged to O\u2019Malley.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been together a long time; we\u2019ve been together almost nine years. So, a lot of the shimmer and shine has faded and we\u2019re just living every damn day as best we can,\u201d Bryant told Meyers about her relationship. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other through a lot. Like, he used to work as a full-blown garbage man \u2014 not a joke, just a garbage man. I used to sweep up hair in a barber shop. I mean, we\u2019ve, like, been through it.\u201d\n\nBryant also detailed how the former SNL writer proposed.\n\n\u201cI had my purse and our mail and all these boxes, and I walked to our door and our dog had a bow tie on. I was like, \u2018My dog doesn\u2019t wear a bow tie! Where is he going tonight?\u2019 Basically, the second I shut the door, a man \u2014 who I discovered was Conner \u2014 frantically came around the corner and was just like, \u2018Will you marry me?!\u2019\u201d Bryant explained at the time. \u201cNo box. No \u2018I love you.\u2019 Just a man in full terror standing very far from a dog in a bow tie, just holding a loose ring going, \u2018Will you marry me?!\u2019 I was like, \u2018What?!\u2019 I truly couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening, and I kept saying, \u2018Is this a joke? Are you doing a joke?\u2019 And then I said, \u2018Of course I\u2019ll marry you. I love you.\u2019 And it was really nice.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHe was like, \u2018Well, you always said that you wanted it to happen in our house if it ever happened.\u2019 I was like, \u2018That\u2019s true; I wanted it to be private.\u2019 He was like, \u2018But I also knew you probably wanted to be wearing a bra and have makeup on, so I knew I had to do it after you just got home from work \u2014 otherwise it would never be another moment.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aidy-bryant-and-conner-omalley.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aidy-bryant-and-conner-omalley.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aidy-bryant-and-conner-omalley.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/snls-aidy-bryant-marries-conner-omalley/", "title": "SNL\u2019s Aidy Bryant Marries Conner O\u2019Malley", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 star Aidy Bryant married her longtime love Conner O\u2019Malley \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "SNL\u2019s Aidy Bryant Is Married!", "description": "\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 star Aidy Bryant married her longtime love Conner O\u2019Malley \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/snls-aidy-bryant-marries-conner-omalley/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aidy-bryant-and-conner-omalley.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aidy-bryant-and-conner-omalley.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-30T16:33:05+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 star Aidy Bryant married her longtime love Conner O\u2019Malley \u2014 get the details", "title": "SNL\u2019s Aidy Bryant Is Married!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aidy-bryant-and-conner-omalley.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525105985.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
