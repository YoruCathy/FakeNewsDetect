The industry has a noted weakness for star power, and Pacino in particular so rarely does projects for the small screen that his lead role as the disgraced college-football coach Joe Paterno was thought to be a shoo-in. But voters, apparently, were not impressed. The movie was, at least, nominated for outstanding TV movie, which is more than we can say for the other big snub in the hybrid limited series, movie, and special categories:David Lynch\u2019s 18-part Twin Peaks: The Return. Though nominated for nine awards, including writing and directing for Lynch himself, star Kyle MacLachlan was passed over.\n\nInstead, for that category, the Academy honored pop star John Legend for his lead role in NBC\u2019s fantastic production of Jesus Christ Superstar: Live in Concert, putting the quadruple-threat well on his way to finishing off his EGOT. The biblical musical nabbed performance awards for its entire leading cast: Sara Bareilles and Brandon Victor Dixon were each honored, and including technical categories, the production earned 13 nominations overall. That\u2019s a bit of a coup, given how campy and inelegant live musicals such as these have been in the past; fortunately, the Academy paid attention to the most successful production of the recent ones we\u2019ve seen.\n\nNBC, which hosts the Emmys telecast this year, had plenty to be happy about more generally: the broadcast institution has ceded ground to both premium cable and streaming services for the last few decades, but vaulted over most of the competition to land 78 total nominations this year, putting it ahead of FX, Hulu, Amazon, and even Showtime. (The only two networks to beat it were Emmys juggernauts Netflix and HBO. For the first time in 18 years, HBO was unseated in total nominations, as Netflix squeaked by, earning just four more overall nominations; that\u2019s a team that is probably very unhappy Pacino wasn\u2019t nominated.)\n\nNBC managed its position through the combined power of Jesus Christ Superstar and recent Emmys golden child Saturday Night Live, which saw a whole slew of supporting cast members and guest stars nominated. Several of them were old favorites of the Academy\u2014including Alec Baldwin, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, and nominated guest star Tina Fey. But it was quite a surprise to see the long-overlooked but beloved mainstay of the show, Kenan Thompson, nominated for supporting actor as well; similarly, cast member Aidy Bryant was nominated in supporting actress for the first time. NBC also managed to nab another round of nominations for its drama This Is Us, although in a surprising snub, Mandy Moore\u2014who is reliably quite heartbreaking in the drama\u2014was not nominated for her leading role.\n\nBut for all of the network\u2019s successes in variety and drama, it failed to make inroads in the category of variety talk. Neither Seth Meyers nor Jimmy Fallon were nominated for their late-night shows\u2014which is more surprising for Meyers, who has managed to make a name for himself in the crowded environment of the Trump era. Similarly, NBC floundered with its two major comedy hopefuls: the celebrated reboot Will & Grace and critical darling The Good Place. Both series were shut out in the series categories; television-comedy institution Ted Danson did snag a nomination, as did Megan Mullally, but otherwise both shows were left out of the major categories. Seven-time nominee Sean Hayes was not recognized at all.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d3d1e975989820008deba1f/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Sonia_Saraiya%252520(1).png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3fc3f4dff5bd4d67e0ff66/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss01-drama-actor-sterling-brown-emmy-nominations-2018.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4789c3fde90b0b82d2eba1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-970258562.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4786576c0055288786d97a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-Emmys-Noms-2018.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3fc3fb3d9d835313b6f0ba/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss03-drama-actor-matthew-rhys-emmy-nominations-2018.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3fc3f7acd469252aac12fc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss02-drama-actor-milo-ventimiglia-emmy-nominations-2018.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b477a054f46c70bca18e288/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/sandra-oh-emmy-nomination-lead-actress-killing-eve-historic.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sonia Saraiya", "Sonia Saraiy", "Yohana Dest", "Laura Bradle", "Vanity Fai"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/2018-emmy-nominations-snubs-surprises", "title": "2018 Emmy Nominations: This Year\u2019s Biggest Snubs and Surprises", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Lots of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Saturday Night Live\u2014and a surprising lack of Will & Grace.", "id": "5b4794aa6c0055288786d989", "keywords": "television,the handmaid's tale,game of thrones,westworld,al pacino,alison brie,kenan thompson,henry winkler,ted danson,larry david,hbo,netflix,will & grace,this is us,nbc,jesus christ superstar,john legend,awards,emmys 2018", "news_keywords": "television,the handmaid's tale,game of thrones,westworld,al pacino,alison brie,kenan thompson,henry winkler,ted danson,larry david,hbo,netflix,will & grace,this is us,nbc,jesus christ superstar,john legend,awards,emmys 2018", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b4794aa6c0055288786d989", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Lots of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Saturday Night Live\u2014and a surprising lack of Will & Grace.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Lots of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Saturday Night Live\u2014and a surprising lack of Will & Grace.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "2018 Emmy Nominations: This Year\u2019s Biggest Snubs and Surprises", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/2018-emmy-nominations-snubs-surprises"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Lots of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and Saturday Night Live\u2014and a surprising lack of Will & Grace.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4795d24f46c70bca18e293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Emmys-Snubs-Surprises.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "2018 Emmy Nominations: This Year\u2019s Biggest Snubs and Surprises"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532016000.0, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
