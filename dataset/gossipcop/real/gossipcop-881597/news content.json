{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_(season_12)", "text": "The twelfth season of America's Got Talent, an American talent show competition, began broadcasting in the United States during 2017, from May 30 to September 20 on NBC. Following the previous season, Nick Cannon ended his role as host of the program following a disagreement with the network, leading to producers hiring Tyra Banks as his replacement.[2] The guest judges for Judge Cuts this season included Chris Hardwick, DJ Khaled, Laverne Cox and Seal.[3][4][5]\n\nThe twelfth season was won by singing ventriloquist Darci Lynne, with singer Angelica Hale finishing second, and glow-light dance troupe Light Balance placing third.[6] During its broadcast, the season averaged around 12.66 million viewers and is the highest viewed in the program's history to date. The season is most notable for the death of a participant outside of filming, who was subsequently given tribute by the program.[7][8]\n\nSeason Overview [ edit ]\n\nOpen auditions took place in late 2016, within Chicago, Austin, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Diego, New York City, Charleston, Memphis, and Los Angeles,[9] with online auditions also accepted by producers. As with the previous year, the judges' auditions were held and filmed in March at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles. The Judge Cuts stage of the competition saw the involvement of comedian Chris Hardwick, media personality DJ Khaled, actress Laverne Cox, and singer and musician Seal as guest judges for this stage.[3][4][5]\n\nAfter eight years of hosting America's Got Talent, Nick Cannon's future on the program became uncertain after he faced criticism from NBC over a joke he made on his 2017 Showtime comedy special, Stand Up, Don't Shoot, which the network deemed as potentially racist. Cannon determined from this that it was best he left the program rather than to remain and face the possibility of being fired by the network, and so announced his resignation from the program on February 13, 2017, a month before production of the twelfth season was to begin.[10] Although the network would not accept his announcement to begin with, owing to the fact that Cannon was still under contract to host AGT, the network's executives eventually agreed that his decision was the best course of action under the circumstances, and thus advised the production staff to find a replacement before the new season was due to begin.[11] On March 12, television personality Tyra Banks was unveiled as the new host for America's Got Talent, prior to filming commencing. Apart from the change in host, the program required no further changes, although production staff were forced to take care with airing the audition of a participant, after they died in an accident outside of filming.[7]\n\nOf the participants who auditioned for this season, 36 secured a place in the live quarter-finals, with twelve quarter-finalists in each one - amongst these included: singing ventriloquist Darci Lynne, singer and ukeleleist Mandy Harvey, singer Christian Guardino, glow-light dance troupe Light Balance, and singer Angelina Green,[12] who had each received a golden buzzer from the main judges; singer Angelica Hale, singer and guitarist Chase Goehring, singer Celine Tam, and soul singer Johnny Manuel,[12] who had each received a golden buzzer from the guest judges; and vocal group Final Draft, comic darevevil Bello Nock, and video-mappers Oskar and Gaspar, who were chosen as WildCard quarter-finalists. Around 22 quarter-finalists advanced to and split between the two semi-finals - including dog tricks act Pompeyo Family Dogs, chosen as the WildCard semi-finalist - with 10 semi-finalists securing a place in the finals.

in 2017, and involved the death of a participant, American physician Brandon Rogers, outside of filming during the auditions stages of the competition. Rogers became involved in the twelfth season when producers came across his YouTube videos, in which he had become a viral success story as a result of his skill in singing various different songs, including one by Boyz II Men. Although he had performed well and had voiced optimism at potentially earning a place in the live rounds, Rogers became involved in a fatal automobile accident on June 11, 2017, and died in hospital the following day.[7] Producers felt it unwise to showcase footage of his performances without consent of his family, but prior to the Judge Cuts episodes being aired, they eventually were given to showcase Rogers' audition as a special tribute in his memory on July 11.[8]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Crystal_Clear_action_button_cancel.svg/20px-Crystal_Clear_action_button_cancel.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Tyra_Banks_2012_Shankbone.JPG/180px-Tyra_Banks_2012_Shankbone.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Crystal_Clear_action_bookmark.png/20px-Crystal_Clear_action_bookmark.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Crystal_Clear_app_clean.svg/20px-Crystal_Clear_app_clean.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Yellow_ffff00_pog.svg/15px-Yellow_ffff00_pog.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Playing_card_club_A.svg/20px-Playing_card_club_A.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Playing_card_heart_A.svg/15px-Playing_card_heart_A.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Playing_card_heart_A.svg/20px-Playing_card_heart_A.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Crystal_Clear_action_bookmark.png/15px-Crystal_Clear_action_bookmark.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Playing_card_club_A.svg/15px-Playing_card_club_A.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Yellow_ffff00_pog.svg/20px-Yellow_ffff00_pog.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Crystal_Clear_app_clean.png/20px-Crystal_Clear_app_clean.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_(season_12)", "title": "America's Got Talent (season 12)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
