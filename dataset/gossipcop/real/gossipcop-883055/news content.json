And while behind bars both brothers found wives: Erik has been married for 20 years and Lyle for 14, Rand said.\n\nThis Wednesday, after decades apart, the brothers finally came face to face at R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.\n\nAn undated image from Google Maps shows the San Diego's R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility.

Brian Anderson\n\nTheir story began on Aug. 20, 1989, when Lyle, then 21, and Erik, then 18, opened fire on their wealthy parents inside the family\u2019s Beverly Hills mansion, using shotguns they bought days before the murders.\n\nTheir father, Jose Menendez, a successful Cuban-American business executive, was shot point-blank in the head. Their mother, Kitty Menendez, was shot several times in her torso and face.\n\nAuthorities arrested the brothers in 1990 after their psychologist\u2019s girlfriend went to police claiming Erik had confessed the murders to the psychologist during a session and Lyle had threatened the doctor\u2019s life, thus voiding doctor-patient privilege.\n\nIn this file photo, brothers Erik Menendez and Lyle Menendez listen to a charge of murder conspiracy against them, Dec. 29, 1992, in Los Angeles. The brothers pled innocent to the new indictment which dropped the original charge that they killed their parents for money. The indictment was returned nearly three years after Joseph and Kitty Menendez were found slain in their home.

The defense argued the brothers\u2019 acted in self-defense after years enduring their parents\u2019 abuse.\n\nIn this file photo, Lyle Menendez looks back at the spectators in the courtroom during final arguments in the second murder trial of Lyle and his brother Erik in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles, Feb. 22, 1996. For the second time in as many days, final arguments prompted a motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor's suggestion there wasn't enough evidence to show the brothers were abused by their parents.

Nick Ut/AP, FILE\n\nTheir first trials ended in mistrials, but at the end of a second trial in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life prison terms without the possibility of parole.\n\nErik, left, and Lyle Menendez are seen here as a young men in this undated family photo. Brian Anderson\n\nTheir reunion began when Lyle was transferred from Northern California's Mule Creek State Prison to San Diego's R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in February 2018, corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton told ABC News.\n\nErik had been at this San Diego facility since July 2013, she said.\n\nBut when Lyle was transferred in February, they were housed in different sections so they could not interact, Thornton said. On April 4, Eric was transferred to Lyle's housing facility within that prison, and in that facility, all the inmates have the ability to interact with one another, she said.\n\nThey can now see each other every day at meals and in the exercise yard, Rand said.\n\nRand said the last few years Lyle told him that he \"missed his brother so much. And Erik had also talked about how much he missed Lyle. So this is just an overwhelming, emotional, happy moment for not only the brothers but their entire family.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/menendez-brothers-ap-jpo-180406_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/menendez-brothers-ap-jpo-180406_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Emily Shapiro", "Muriel Pearson", "Lauren Effron", "April", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/menendez-brothers-burst-tears-emotional-prison-reunion-decades/story?id=54281350", "title": "Menendez brothers burst into tears during emotional prison reunion after decades apart", "meta_data": {"description": "Erik and Lyle Menendez are now both in the same San Diego prison.", "keywords": "Menendez, Menendez brothers", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
