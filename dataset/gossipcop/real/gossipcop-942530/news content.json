He was 61.\n\nRipert was in France to film an episode of Bourdain\u2019s CNN show Parts Unknown.\n\n\u201cAnthony was my best friend. An exceptional human being, so inspiring & generous. One of the great storytellers who connected w so many. I pray he is at peace from the bottom of my heart. My love & prayers are also w his family, friends and loved ones.\u201d Ripert wrote.\n\nRipert met Bourdain more than 20 years ago while they were working in New York City restaurants.\n\nThe two collaborated frequently on screen, with Ripert usually playing the \u201cstraight man\u201d \u2013 whom Bourdain gleefully tormented with spicy food and wild adventures.\n\nItalian actress Asia Argento, who had been dating Bourdain since last year, released a statement earlier Friday, calling Bourdain, \u201cmy love, my rock, my protector.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.
