Zedd/Instagram\n\nThe INSIDER Summary:\n\nZedd and Selena Gomez had a very short-lived romance back in 2015.\n\nZedd recently opened up in an interview about the dark side to dating the superstar.\n\nThe EDM star detailed a time when he was \"pissed\" after getting caught up in a media frenzy.\n\nWhile he knew what he was getting into, Zedd had no idea that the relationship would change his life.\n\nOh my! Zedd and Selena Gomez were one of our favorite short-lived romances. They both seemed so sweet and so good for each other! However, there was a dark side. On Aug. 10, Zedd revealed the one thing that pissed him off about her.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a while since Zedd, 27, and Selena Gomez, 25, dated in 2015, but we still have a special place for the couple in our hearts. Zedd was always so sweet and tender toward Selly, even after they split. However, it turns out that that wasn\u2019t ALWAYS the case. As a matter of fact, he told Billboard that there was a time when he was downright \u201cpissed\u201d while dating her! Click here for pics of the former duo.\n\n\u201cReporters were calling my parents,\u201d he said, describing how insane the media frenzy was after the public learned of the star-studded relationship. \u201cPeople were hacking my friends\u2019 phones. I was pissed.\u201d It\u2019s not that he was surprised, but it was still freaky to be so bombarded. \u201cI kind of knew what I was getting myself into,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe is one of the most talked about people in the world, but I had no idea how much that would change my life.\u201d\n\nClearly Zedd isn\u2019t interested in being involved in that kind of media frenzy again. He refused to tell Billboard whether or not he\u2019s dating anyone at the moment. One thing he will talk about is his strong feelings towards Donald Trump. \u201cNo matter how big the scandal is, no matter how insane a [Trump] tweet is, it just keeps going. You feel powerless, and that\u2019s terrible to me,\u201d he ranted. \u201cTake that to a bigger scale and you end up in North Korea, where people are slaves of their own country!\u201d He even urged his fellow EDM stars to use their voices, even when it\u2019s scary. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose fans. I understand where they are coming from, but I disagree with that being a good reason not to speak up.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/598349668754331d504f6de8?width=150&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/598df4720dafe80da64a7cf7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/zedd-worst-part-of-dating-selena-gomez-2017-8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/598df4720dafe80da64a7cf6?width=1200&format=jpeg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/598df4720dafe80da64a7cf6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix", "Hollywood Life"], "canonical_link": "http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/10/zedd-selena-gomez-relationship-pissed-off-billboard/", "title": "Selena Gomez's ex Zedd speaks out about the worst part of dating the superstar: 'I was pissed'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Selena Gomez's ex Zedd speaks out about the worst part of dating the superstar: 'I was pissed'", "date": "2017-08-11", "news_keywords": "Contributor, Hollywood Life, Culture, Zedd, Selena Gomez, Relationships, Emy LaCroix", "description": "While we may have thought the short-lived romance was a match made in heaven, Zedd revealed that there was a major downside to dating Selena Gomez.", "author": "Emy LaCroix", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez's ex Zedd speaks out about the worst part of dating the superstar: 'I was pissed'", "description": "While we may have thought the short-lived romance was a match made in heaven, Zedd revealed that there was a major downside to dating Selena Gomez.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/zedd-worst-part-of-dating-selena-gomez-2017-8", "image": "https://i.insider.com/598df4720dafe80da64a7cf6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Selena Gomez's ex Zedd speaks out about the worst part of dating the superstar: 'I was pissed'", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-11", "sailthru.tags": "Contributor, Hollywood Life, Culture, Zedd, Selena Gomez, Relationships, Emy LaCroix", "sailthru.description": "While we may have thought the short-lived romance was a match made in heaven, Zedd revealed that there was a major downside to dating Selena Gomez.", "sailthru.author": "Emy LaCroix", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/598df4720dafe80da64a7cf5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/598df4720dafe80da64a7cf5?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "control", "pfi-wider-content": "variant", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "variant", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "control", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "598df4730dafe80da64a7cf8", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502380800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
