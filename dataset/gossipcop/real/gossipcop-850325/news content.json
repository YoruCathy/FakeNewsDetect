The pop star and Mark Ronson released their new single and music video, \u201cNothing Breaks Like a Heart,\u201d on Thursday, November 29.\n\nThis is the first time that Cyrus, 26, has dropped new music since her 2017 album, Younger Now, which featured the hit single \u201cMalibu.\u201d She started teasing \u201cNothing Breaks Like a Heart\u201d on social media on Monday, November 26, and continued to share video clips leading up to the release.\n\nThe Hannah Montana alum and Ronson, 43, are set to perform the tune, which will appear on his upcoming fifth album, during the December 15 episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\n\u201cI had my manager reach out to her, but we never hooked up. Then a few months ago, I sent a little idea for the chorus of this song and she wrote right back,\u201d the \u201cUptown Funk\u201d producer recently told Official Charts.\n\nSince recording the track, Cyrus lost the Malibu home she shared with her fianc\u00e9, Liam Hemsworth, in the devastating wildfires that swept through Southern California earlier this month.\n\n\u201cShe is such a positive person,\u201d Ronson told the U.K. website. \u201cShe\u2019s like the phoenix. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to build a beautiful house with all her pigs and dogs and she\u2019ll turn it into something magical.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Miley-Cyrus1.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Miley-Cyrus1.jpg?crop=0px%2C172px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/miley-cyrus-returns-with-new-single-nothing-breaks-like-a-heart/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Returns With New Single \u2018Nothing Breaks Like a Heart\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson released the music video for their new single, \u2018Nothing Breaks Like a Heart,\u2019 on Thursday, November 29 \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "She\u2019s Back!
