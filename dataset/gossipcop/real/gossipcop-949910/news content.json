If a commenter tells a celebrity (or a friend) not to do something that might hurt their kid, well, that\u2019s useful. However, the comments section of many celebrity fathers\u2019 accounts are full of deeply unhelpful advice. Take, for instance, Justin Timberlake\u2019s account, which now features a photo of his son, Silas Timberlake, kissing his mom, Jessica Biel, followed by a mass of comments about the length of his son\u2019s hair. According to internet busybodies \u2014 mostly male and mostly very certain of their views \u2014 having long hair is going to somehow damage the kid long-term.\n\nThe picture was taken in Paris and shows the three-year-old with shoulder length hair and a very loud and boat-themed romper kissing his mom on the lips. The caption reads, \u201cIf that pic doesn\u2019t say \u2018City Of Love\u2019 then I\u2019m out\u2026.\u201d Privileged? Yes. Charming? Absolutely. Nonetheless, the internet did its thing.\n\n\u201cI thought that son was a daughter which is just another reason why it shouldn\u2019t grow out,\u201d wrote one commenter, before another took issue with his romper.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cLong hair and feminine-romper looking thing\u2026 sheesh,\u201d wrote another.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd then the back and forth begain.\n\n\u201cWho cares if his hair is long!\u201d wrote one JT supporter. \u201cWe should focus on raising kind children, so maybe they don\u2019t grow up and become mean grown-ups that usual social media as a bullying platform!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we stop thinking about his hair fl and marvel in the wonderful opportunity this child has of having loving parents, who on top of that take him to Paris at such a young age,\u201d wrote another. (The likely answer is \u201cno,\u201d but it\u2019s a worthy sentiment.)\n\nParent shaming is always annoying, but this example might be the worst to date as it checks both the \u201cWho cares?\u201d box and the \u201cThat\u2019s Not a Thing\u201d box. Also, these people are all failing to appreciate that the kid has very cool hair. Do with it what you will Silas, you\u2019ve been blessed with a rock star mane.\n\nADVERTISEMENT", "images": ["https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/movie-theaters-reopen.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=1024&h=576", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/viral-mom-buzz-helmet.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=1024&h=576", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/fatherly-icon-white.svg", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/homebodies-signup.jpg?q=65&fit=clip&w=600&h=360", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Untitled-2.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=600", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/disneyclassicssale-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=1024&h=576", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/preloader.gif", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Untitled-2.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=1200", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harrymeganlafood-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=1024&h=576", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/fatherly-icon.svg", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/socialdistance-phases-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=1024&h=576", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/viral-mom-buzz-helmet.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=141&h=141", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gijoe-streaming-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=1024&h=576", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/xfinity-logo.png", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/socialdistance-phases-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=141&h=141", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harrymeganlafood-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=141&h=141"], "top_img": "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Untitled-2.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Raz Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fatherly.com/news/justin-timberlake-son-long-hair-instagram/", "title": "Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Parent-Shamed for Son's Long Hair", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 1667245973359975, "pages": 348596051860210}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "After posting a picture of his son kissing his mother the internet masses attacked Justin Timberlake for the length of his son\u2019s hair.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dad-Shamers Are Out In Force After Justin Timberlake Posted This Pic of His Son", "description": "After posting a picture of his son kissing his mother the internet, Justin Timberlake was criticized for somehow abusing his kid -- who looks like a damn rock star.", "url": "https://www.fatherly.com/news/justin-timberlake-son-long-hair-instagram/", "site_name": "Fatherly", "updated_time": "2018-09-26T16:18:19-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Untitled-2.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=1200", "secure_url": "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Untitled-2.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 650}}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2018-07-09T12:35:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-26T20:18:19+00:00"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\" : \"Commenters elected to call the three-year-old boy their \"daughter.\"\"}", "bt": {"id": 93675, "keywords": "General"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531139722.0, "source": "https://www.fatherly.com", "summary": ""}
