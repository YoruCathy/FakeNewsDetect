Beyond starring in a movie with Kevin, the once-and-future Rocky Balboa also facilitated a moment that could catalyze a breakthrough for Kevin, who has yet to deal with his father\u2019s death. In a larger sense, Stallone\u2019s appearance was the narrative spine for an episode that\u2019s all about how we\u2014and, more specifically, the Pearsons\u2014move forward from trauma.\n\nBefore we get ahead of ourselves, a quick recap: Kevin landed a role in a Ron Howard World War II movie co-starring Stallone, whose character he rescues in the movie. When Kevin shows up with Kate on set, his sister tells Stallone that their father was a big fan of Stallone\u2019s; when Stallone tells Kevin that, Kevin finds himself thrown. He has trouble performing, and hurts his leg amid flashbacks to his childhood. He and Kate fight in his trailer about Kevin\u2019s inability to confront the grief about their loss. Meanwhile, Randall and Beth\u2019s new foster daughter, Deja, arrives, and she\u2019s. . . a little more closed-off than they expected. They appear to have a breakthrough as Randall explains his own upbringing and adoption to Deja, but when she finds out that her mother might be in jail for a long time, she storms off. And in the past, we see Rebecca trying to sweep Jack off his feet after a lengthy dry spell. They wind up talking, as Jack promises to confide in her more. Also, it appears they adopted a stray dog!\n\nThis episode\u2019s threads all tie together in a fascinating way. First, we now know a little more about that leg injury Kevin had on the day his father died; it turns out he suffers from a bad knee, as Kate mentions during a phone conversation. And more importantly, all three Pearson children\u2014and their father\u2014are seen confronting their own traumas in different ways. Kevin, as actor Justin Hartley explained after last week\u2019s episode, has been refusing to deal with his grief\u2014but after a fight with Kate, it appears he is starting to realize he might have to. Kate, by contrast, has been owning and confronting the trauma of losing Jack since Season 1. Randall\u2019s issues are a little different; he must deal with both losing Jack and growing up as an adopted son.\n\n\u201cMy whole childhood, I felt split inside,\u201d Randall told Deja. \u201cThere are these people that I lived with, and then there were my birth parents, who I\u2019d never met. But I thought about them all the time.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Jack, whose alcoholism likely stems from the horrifying experiences he endured during the Vietnam War. (We\u2019re guessing the fact that Kevin\u2019s making a war movie is a very intentional echo.) As the season continues, expect to hear more about those experiences, now that Jack has told Rebecca he\u2019s ready to try and reveal more of his innermost thoughts and fears to her.\n\nAt the heart of all this is Stallone, whose appearance on This Is Us is brief but deliberate. Previous episodes have made reference to Jack\u2019s Rocky fandom, and given that Stallone once played Milo Ventimiglia\u2019s father in a Rocky flick, everything about the appearance felt deliberately thought out\u2014a consistent feature of a series that has grown from a weepy to an earnest, compassionate exploration of grief, trauma, and perseverance. Need more proof that nothing in this episode was an accident? Even the child services agent who dropped Deja off with Randall and Beth was played by a canny actress: Debra Jo Rupp, known to many TV fans as Kitty Forman from That 70s Show, who informally adopted her own son\u2019s best friend. (Perhaps that\u2019s a stretch\u2014but her casting was at least a happy coincidence.)\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Kevin learns the lessons his father might not have had time to fully grasp, and figures out how to confront his inner demons with a little help from his family. With all these people around, there\u2019s got to be at least one he can talk to.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599da913b0fade3511cdf9cf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tv-characters-subway-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cb0de0ec48380731272e2b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/this-is-us-season-2-premiere-recap-jack-death-alcoholic-burned-house.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599da91398f198592affadd3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tv-characters-subway-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cb996fcb64a5571dbcf5ae/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/this-is-us-jack-death-how-did-jack-die-clues-milo-ventimiglia-dan-fogelman.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599da913d3dd2e2d51611c12/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tv-characters-subway-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d4062be6f6bc1cce592d1e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/NUP_177079_2158.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/this-is-us-recap-sylvester-stallone-season-2-episode-3-deja-vu", "title": "This Is Us: Why Sylvester Stallone\u2019s Guest Role Was More than Just a Gimmick", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The NBC drama used its biggest guest appearance yet as the spine for an eye-opening episode.", "id": "59dcf6186932201dfe025a6e", "keywords": "television,this is us,sylvester stallone,nbc", "news_keywords": "television,this is us,sylvester stallone,nbc", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59dcf6186932201dfe025a6e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The NBC drama used its biggest guest appearance yet as the spine for an eye-opening episode.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The NBC drama used its biggest guest appearance yet as the spine for an eye-opening episode.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "This Is Us: Why Sylvester Stallone\u2019s Guest Role Was More than Just a Gimmick", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/this-is-us-recap-sylvester-stallone-season-2-episode-3-deja-vu"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The NBC drama used its biggest guest appearance yet as the spine for an eye-opening episode.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dd3b13942b2805a89a8132/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/this-is-us-recap-season-2-episode-3-sylvester-stallone.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "This Is Us: Why Sylvester Stallone\u2019s Guest Role Was More than Just a Gimmick"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
