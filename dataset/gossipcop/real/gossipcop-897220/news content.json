Meghan, so happy for you, friend. Much love.\"\n\nThe royal wedding will take place at Windsor Castle in May.\n\nAsked how he thought Ms Markle would deal with the pressure of royal life, Korsh said: \"She is just a natural in front of the camera, and her intelligence and poise... I mean if anyone could handle it I'd say it was Meghan.\"\n\nOn the couple's engagement, he added that \"the whole thing is like a fairytale\" describing it as \"like a dream come true\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
