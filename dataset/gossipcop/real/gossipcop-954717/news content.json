Katharine McPhee returned to her starring role in the Broadway musical Waitress and dedicated her first show back to her late father, Daniel McPhee.\n\n\u201cDad, this one\u2019s for you,\u201d the Smash alum, 34, captioned an Instagram photo of herself backstage before the Tuesday, July 24, performance. \u201c@waitressmusical here we go\u2026\u201d\n\nMcPhee announced her father\u2019s passing on July 16. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even writing this. But it is with heavy heart that I share that my sweet sweet Papa left this earth yesterday morning,\u201d she wrote on Instagram at the time. \u201cWe as a family are completely heartbroken and devastated.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cHe was my biggest fan, my biggest champion, always telling me to \u2018Give em hell kid!\u2019 He was so kind and caring and made sure we knew how much he loved us. Not sure my heart will ever be the same. I\u2019m so sad he missed my broadway debut. But when I return to the stage next week I hope he can watch it in peace and from up above. Thank you to all my friends who\u2019ve been so loving and supportive these last 48 hours. I love you Papa. I already miss you so much. This hurts.\u201d McPhee canceled some of her Waitress appearances shortly before her father\u2019s death because of a family emergency.\n\nThe Scorpion star has had a bittersweet month. Us Weekly confirmed her engagement to David Foster on July 3. McPhee revealed on Instagram Saturday, July 21, that her father shared in her joy: \u201cMy ring was the last thing I showed my dad before he passed and makes me smile when I look at this as a reminder of our last conversation.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katharine-mcphee-daniel-mcphee-dedicates-watitress-return.jpg?crop=0px%2C565px%2C1967px%2C1033px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katharine-mcphee-daniel-mcphee-dedicates-watitress-return.jpg?crop=0px%2C525px%2C1967px%2C1112px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katharine-mcphee-daniel-mcphee-dedicates-watitress-return.jpg?crop=0px%2C565px%2C1967px%2C1033px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katharine-mcphee-dedicates-her-waitress-return-to-her-late-father/", "title": "Katharine McPhee Dedicates Her \u2018Waitress\u2019 Return to Her Late Father", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Katharine McPhee dedicated her first show back at \u2018Waitress\u2019 on Tuesday, July 24, to her late father less than two weeks after his death \u2014 read her sweet message", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Katharine McPhee Dedicates Her 'Waitress' Return to Her Late Father", "description": "Katharine McPhee dedicated her first show back at \u2018Waitress\u2019 on Tuesday, July 24, to her late father less than two weeks after his death \u2014 read her sweet message", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katharine-mcphee-dedicates-her-waitress-return-to-her-late-father/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katharine-mcphee-daniel-mcphee-dedicates-watitress-return.jpg?crop=0px%2C565px%2C1967px%2C1033px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katharine-mcphee-daniel-mcphee-dedicates-watitress-return.jpg?crop=0px%2C565px%2C1967px%2C1033px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-25T15:10:17+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Katharine McPhee dedicated her first show back at \u2018Waitress\u2019 on Tuesday, July 24, to her late father less than two weeks after his death \u2014 read her sweet message", "title": "Katharine McPhee Dedicates Her 'Waitress' Return to Her Late Father", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katharine-mcphee-daniel-mcphee-dedicates-watitress-return.jpg?crop=0px%2C565px%2C1967px%2C1033px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532531417.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
