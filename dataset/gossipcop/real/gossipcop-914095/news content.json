Wait\u2026 that\u2018s Greg?\n\nFriday\u2019s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend fall finale brought back Rebecca\u2019s former flame Greg for the first time since Season 2 \u2014 but now he\u2019s played by Pitch Perfect star Skylar Astin, who steps in for original cast member Santino Fontana. In true Crazy Ex fashion, the episode leaned into the absurdity of it all, with Rebecca not recognizing Greg at first, making the recast a statement on how radically our perceptions of people can change over time. (He\u2019s not even the same person!)\n\nRebecca and Greg started fresh with a get-to-know-you duet \u2014 \u201cHello, nice to meet you/You\u2019ve been inside of me,\u201d she sang \u2014 and even after she confessed to sleeping with Greg\u2019s dad, the two didn\u2019t totally shut the door on a possible rekindling. With yet another love interest now in Rebecca\u2019s orbit, TVLine reached out to showrunner Aline Brosh McKenna to get the scoop on the big Greg recasting, what his return means for Rebecca\u2019s already complicated love life \u2014 and what we can expect to see in the back half of the final season.\n\nTVLINE | We haven\u2019t seen Greg since way back in Season 2. When did you first decide he had to come back, in some form?\n\nWell, we had always thought their love relationship would die somewhere during Season 2, but we were going to continue his journey towards figuring out that he was an alcoholic, and towards sobriety. We probably would\u2019ve taken all of Season 2 to do that. Much like Josh and Nathaniel, their stories don\u2019t end when they\u2019re not sleeping with Rebecca. So we had a bunch of stuff we wanted to do with Greg, and then Santino needed to move back to New York, so we accelerated all of that storyline at the beginning of Season 2 and wrapped it up. But we had always wanted to continue telling his story, and their story, and so when we were [writing] this season, we thought, \u201cWe could\u2026\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t want to do it just to recast. We felt like we had an opportunity to do something different, and do it the way that works for our show. So the idea is that it\u2019s a first-person show: It\u2019s all very much filtered through her perception. So she perceives him as different \u2014 first of all, because when you see an ex you haven\u2019t seen for two years, they invariably look and feel very different, but also because he\u2019s changed a lot, and he\u2019s evolved a lot, and he is a different sort of person, in a way. Then what you find out at the end of the episode is that they\u2019ve both changed, and that\u2019s why he seems so different to her. It\u2019s as much the fact that she\u2019s changed as the fact that he\u2019s changed.\n\nTVLINE | Do you feel like Skylar Astin brings a different energy to the role than Santino did? Or is it still like writing for the same character?\n\nOh, I think he brings a different energy to the role, but that\u2019s also because the character\u2019s a different guy. He\u2019s been in recovery for two years, he\u2019s been going to weekly meetings, he\u2019s heard a lot of stories that are way worse than his. I think it\u2019s expanded his humanity, so we\u2019re writing him differently. And the way we\u2019re writing him suits Skylar very well, because I think he exudes an evolved intelligence and a warmth that Greg presumably developed when he was in Atlanta. That\u2019s not to say that Santino couldn\u2019t have played it as well, but Skylar does bring a nice quality to the role and a wonderful connection to Rachel. He just fit in with the group here like crazy. It\u2019s pretty amazing. To come into a show so late, and two seconds later, you\u2019re playing paintball with the cast\u2026 [Laughs]\n\nTVLINE | Did you actually reach out to Santino? I know he\u2019s busy playing Tootsie, but\u2026\n\nWe didn\u2019t reach out to him to play the part, because the whole idea was that it would be played by a different actor. That\u2019s what was exciting to us. But we didn\u2019t want him to be surprised, so the first thing we did was to let him know we\u2019d be recasting the role. And he and Skylar are friends. They did a show together, so that\u2019s nice.\n\nTVLINE | Greg has changed a lot, and not just physically: He\u2019s more centered, he\u2019s less self-destructive. So has he gone through a lot of the same hard psychological work that Rebecca has?\n\nExactly. I think someone who\u2019s been in recovery for two years and somebody who\u2019s been in a pretty intense mental health program for a year have a lot more to talk about than they did the last time they saw each other. Their relationship was characterized by a slight judgment of her by him, always. There was always a slightly neggy energy coming from him towards her, and I think that\u2019s something they now both understand came from an unhealthy impulse on her part, and came from a self-hatred on his part. So they\u2019re actually able to redress some of these issues.\n\nTVLINE | Rebecca came clean and admitted that she slept with Greg\u2019s dad, and he was stunned, understandably. But he did appreciate her honesty, too. Is that a sign that maybe he can accept her as she is, flaws and all?\n\nWell, again, he\u2019s been in meetings where people have talked about doing all kinds of crazy stuff. So I think he has expanded his humanity somewhat, and he recognizes the change in her. She\u2019s somebody who would never have admitted to that before. She was always someone who would\u2019ve tried to get away with it. There\u2019s no reason that she had to be the one to tell him. He was going to find out two seconds later. So he recognizes the courage in that, even though, obviously, it\u2019s rather repellent to him, and quite upsetting.\n\nTVLINE | We\u2019ve done \u201cThe Math of Love Triangles\u201d before, so is Rebecca now in a love rectangle?\n\nShe is in some sort of love quadrangle, yeah.\n\nTVLINE | Do you see these three guys appealing to different aspects of her?\n\nOh, definitely. We\u2019ve consciously tried to explore the different tropes of men in romantic comedies, so in the way that she is somewhat adhering to the stereotype of a crazy ex-girlfriend, we have high school hero Josh Chan, rich a\u2013hole Nathaniel Plimpton and snarky best friend Greg. They\u2019re all things that she\u2019s attracted to, and they all have something about them she really loves and admires. But she\u2019s still figuring herself out. She\u2019s really trying to figure out who she is, and what her place is in the world.\n\nTVLINE | Yeah, Rebecca even mentioned that this week: Does she even need to end up with anyone?\n\nYeah, does she need to be with anyone? What\u2019s the role of love in her life? How important is it to her? Are any of these guys suitable for that? Is she ready to be in a relationship with anybody? Love is her drug of choice, and unlike booze and drugs, she can\u2019t just put it down and walk away from it completely. That\u2019s something that Dr. Akopian said to her last year: You need and deserve love. So for her, the challenge is: How is she ever going to dip her toe in that with anybody, without getting swamped and overwhelmed and going down a rabbit hole?\n\nTVLINE | We\u2019re entering the homestretch here, the back half of the final season. What can you tell us about what\u2019s coming up?\n\nWe come back with an episode that is just completely bonkers. It\u2019s one of the silliest ones we\u2019ve ever done. We really enjoyed making it. And we continue to explore these relationships, and where Rebecca\u2019s going in her life. She\u2019s landing the plane now. She\u2019s trying to make some decisions based on the things she\u2019s learned about herself. We gave her a lot of real estate after her suicide attempt, both by doing an eight-month jump, and then also this season, she hasn\u2019t really been involved with anybody romantically. She\u2019s been going down the list of unresolved relationships, and obviously, this relationship with Greg is one of the most unresolved. So there\u2019s a chance to go back to that with the tools that she\u2019s learned, and with a year under her belt since the [suicide attempt].\n\nTVLINE | And is the series finale really set on Valentine\u2019s Day, like Greg said this week?\n\nI mean\u2026 that\u2019s the end of the series of holidays, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCrazy Ex fans, let\u2019s talk: Drop your thoughts on New Greg, and Season 4 so far, in the comments below.", "images": ["https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-episode-8-rebecca-greg.jpg?w=300&h=203", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-tvline-2014/library/images/follow_us_on_facebook_graphic.png", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lucifer-season-4-episode-4.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-finale.jpg?w=620", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/best-hangboards.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-episode-8-rebecca.jpg?w=300&h=203", "https://i0.wp.com/www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/top-chef-season-15-contestants-hosts-Tom-Colicchio.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/alia-shawkat-leaves-brad-pitts-house-backgrid-ftr.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-episode-8-greg-rebecca.jpg?w=620", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/webp.net-resizeimage-1-10.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=180%2C101", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/swat-season-3-finale-schedule.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-greg-skylar-astin.jpg?w=200&h=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-60R-umvc0T-Cw&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=tvline.com&path=%2F2018%2F12%2F07%2Fcrazy-ex-girlfriend-recap-season-4-episode-8-greg-skylar-astin%2F&ct=article&lob=tvline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1009303&comment_count=22", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-performs-at-global-citizens-concert.png?resize=180%2C101", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-episode-8-greg-rebecca.jpg?w=620&h=420&crop=1", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-203220h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/brooklyn-nine-nine-season-7-episode-13-finale-nbc-1.jpg?w=620", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/one-chicago-cast-exits-2.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/dw-2.jpg?w=280"], "top_img": "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-episode-8-greg-rebecca.jpg?w=620", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Nemetz"], "canonical_link": "https://tvline.com/2018/12/07/crazy-ex-girlfriend-recap-season-4-episode-8-greg-skylar-astin/", "title": "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Boss on Recasting Greg, Rebecca's New 'Love Quadrangle'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "9ad238c78ee34da2d6d96a41981790d2"}, "description": "\"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's\" showrunner explains why they recast Greg with Skylar Astin, and what his return means for Rebecca's love life.", "news_keywords": "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, The CW", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1377345661", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Boss on Recasting Greg, Rebecca's New 'Love Quadrangle'", "url": "https://tvline.com/2018/12/07/crazy-ex-girlfriend-recap-season-4-episode-8-greg-skylar-astin/", "description": "Warning: The following post contains spoilers for Friday\u2019s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.
