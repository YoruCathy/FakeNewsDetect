The couple have shared a picture of the card sitting on a Christmas tree in their home at Clarence House.\n\nPrinted on the front of the Christmas card is the Prince of Wales' feathers and the Duchess' cipher. The festive card, which is surrounded by a thin red border, reads on the inside: \"Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year\". The regal picture was taken when Camilla was celebrating her 70th birthday with the Prince of Wales.\n\nTo mark her milestone birthday on 17 July, the couple were dressed for a private summer party at Charles' Highgrove home. Camilla wore an ivory embellished dress by Anna Valentine and accessorised her outfit with a detailed flower necklace. Meanwhile, Prince Charles styled himself in a tailored black dinner jacket \u2013 by Savile Row bespoke tailors Anderson & Sheppard \u2013 and a black tie. The couple smiled for the picture \u2013 taken by royal photographer Hugo Burnand \u2013 which was taken in the orchard room in Clarence House a few days before Camilla's birthday.\n\nRELATED:The Cambridges release official family portrait for Christmas\n\nHugo, the famously known regal photographer, often works with the couple as he photographed their beloved wedding nuptials back in 2005.
