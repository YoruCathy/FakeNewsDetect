So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night\u2019s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas\u2019s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nBut Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, \u201cI want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this\u201d), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government\u2019s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to process.\u201d He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his \u201cwarmest condolences\u201d on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those \u201cwho won\u2019t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.\u201d For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence\u2014Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas\u2014the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: \u201cOur forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,\u201d Kimmel said, incredulous.\n\nPoliticians\u2019 inaction\u2014and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control\u2014was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel\u2019s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, \u201cSome say it\u2019s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it\u2019s far too late.\u201d He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nRelated Videos\n\n\u201cIt should be hard for everyone to fathom,\u201d Corden said. \u201cGun violence should not be a staple of American life.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the response to these shootings\u2014of which there have been 275 so far in 2017\u2014has become rote. \u201cPeople are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers. \u201cWe\u2019re shocked, we\u2019re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don\u2019t talk about guns,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, \u201cthe vast majority of Americans want.\u201d Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers\u2014which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves\u2014was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night\u2019s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree\u2014for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to \u201cpoliticize\u201d an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about guns.\u201d\n\nColbert closed out The Late Show\u2019s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: \u201cDoing nothing is cowardice.\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to make America great again? Do something the past two presidents haven\u2019t been able to do: Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation.\u201d\n\nFormer 'Daily Show' correspondents Samantha Bee and Jason Jones on falling in love:", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21/59c3b8d76d140b5bd74f4100_GettyImages-849709530.jpg?crop=0px,0px,3000px,1500px&w=790px", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=3223313014351882&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21/59c3b8d76d140b5bd74f4100_GettyImages-849709530.jpg?crop=0px,0px,3000px,1500px&w=790px", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/jimmy-kimmel-emotional-response-las-vegas-shooting-best-monologue/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel's Indignant, Emotional Response to Vegas Shooting Was the Best Monologue on Monday Night", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Meyers all made the case for stricter gun control after the Las Vegas shooting Sunday night.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel's Indignant, Emotional Response to Vegas Shooting Was the Best Monologue on Monday Night", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Meyers all made the case for stricter gun control after the Las Vegas shooting Sunday night.", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/jimmy-kimmel-emotional-response-las-vegas-shooting-best-monologue/", "site_name": "W Magazine | Women's Fashion & Celebrity News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21/59c3b8d76d140b5bd74f4100_GettyImages-849709530.jpg?crop=0px,0px,3000px,1500px&w=790px", "secure_url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21/59c3b8d76d140b5bd74f4100_GettyImages-849709530.jpg?crop=0px,0px,3000px,1500px&w=790px", "width": 3000, "height": 2000}}, "fb": {"app_id": 450372832509980}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert, and Seth Meyers all made the case for stricter gun control after the Las Vegas shooting Sunday night.", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel's Indignant, Emotional Response to Vegas Shooting Was the Best Monologue on Monday Night", "image": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21/59c3b8d76d140b5bd74f4100_GettyImages-849709530.jpg?crop=0px,0px,3000px,1500px&w=790px&mbid=social_retweet"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruYeBXudsds"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
