As Mendes strummed his acoustic guitar on the plaintive R&B ballad, audience members including Halsey got emotional, with the impact of the soul-stirring chorus going through the roof as the dozen students in \"Youth\" hoodies flanked the men and raised their voices.\n\nThe crowd rose to its feet when the choir's voices leaned into the refrain, with the students directly impacted by gun violence vowing to stay strong and crowding onto the stage around Mendes and Khalid as they soaked in the love from the star-packed arena.\n\nThe performance was introduced by Bebe Rexha, who said, \"Last Friday, we experienced another tragedy, this time at Santa Fe High School in Texas. Just a few weeks, ago many students from the very high school joined the protest against gun violence. And they're no different than tens of thousands of young adults across this nation who took a stand and are raising their voices to say: things must change. They inspire me with their hope, with their compassion and with their determination to make a difference and build a better world.\"\n\nWatch Mendes and Khalid's performance above.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?4863e69cb9d656c61185", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/2018-BBMAs-recirc.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8456921/shawn-mendes-khalid-perform-youth-billboard-music-awards-2018-video", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Put on Powerful Performance of 'Youth' at the Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-05-20T22:18:39-04:00", "published_time": "2018-05-20T22:10:40-04:00"}, "description": "Taking the stage for the second time on Sunday night (May 20) at the Billboard Music Awards, Shawn Mendes paid emotional tribute to the victims of gun violence with a moving performance of his track \"Youth\" featuring Khalid and the show choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.", "og": {"description": "Taking the stage for the second time on Sunday night (May 20) at the Billboard Music Awards, Shawn Mendes paid emotional tribute to the victims of gun violence with a moving performance of his track \"Youth\" featuring Khalid and the show choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Watch Shawn Mendes & Khalid Perform 'Youth' | Billboard Music Awards 2018 | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8456921/shawn-mendes-khalid-perform-youth-billboard-music-awards-2018-video", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Put on Powerful Performance of 'Youth' at the Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Taking the stage for the second time on Sunday night (May 20) at the Billboard Music Awards, Shawn Mendes paid emotional tribute to the victims of gun violence with a moving performance of his track \"Youth\" featuring Khalid and the show choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Put on Powerful Performance of 'Youth' at the Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526868640.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
