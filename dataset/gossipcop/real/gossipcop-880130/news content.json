We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\u201d\n\nThe couple are parents to 4-year-old son Axl, who the duo seems to dote over.

I laid out my outfit the night before,\u201d Duhamel told Us Weekly with a laugh. \u201cIt was a big build to the moment that I could finally talk to her.
