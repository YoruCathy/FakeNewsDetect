We wish nothing but the best for each other, and ask for your support and understanding at this time.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThe couple met on Higgins\u2019 season of The Bachelor, which premiered in January 2016. Higgins, 29, ultimately offered his final rose and proposed to Bushnell, 27 \u2014 but not without a little controversy after he famously told both finalists \u2014 Bushnell and JoJo Fletcher \u2014 that he loved them during the Fantasy Suites episode.\n\nNevertheless, the two did their best to overcome their issues together and Bushnell moved to Higgins\u2019 hometown of Denver shortly after going public with their engagement following the season finale, which aired in March.\n\nOf Higgins declaration of love to both women, Bushnell told PEOPLE exclusively at the time that \u201cpost-filming was more of an emotional roller coaster than the actual show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fall more in love with Ben every day and it\u2019s hard to separate what happened long ago and my current feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing. It does wear on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why did I have to go through that hurt? It\u2019s already a few months of confusion and tears and then to have to deal with it again. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nHiggins, meanwhile, told PEOPLE he couldn\u2019t apologize \u201cfor being honest or expressing what I thought was the best thing to express at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get us wrong. Throughout this whole show airing and conversations we\u2019ve had about decisions and life, it hasn\u2019t always been easy,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s added a whole new level to our relationship. And [the show ultimately] led me to this woman who I love deeply. She\u2019s the only woman I\u2019ll love from now on.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Christina and Tarek El Moussa\u2019s Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship\n\nSix months later, Higgins and Bushnell returned to the small screen for one season of their Freeform reality show Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After?\n\nAhead of the premiere, the two revealed exclusively to PEOPLE in October that they were undergoing couples counseling at their church: \u201cWe\u2019re not the perfect couple,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cFar from it! But we are trying really hard and we love each other a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many weird elements to being in a relationship after The Bachelor,\u201d said Bushnell. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten in arguments like any other couple, but about some things that other couples wouldn\u2019t have to fight about, like the fact that we met when he was dating other women. You can say that\u2019s what I signed up for, but it\u2019s still real life and it\u2019s still hard.\u201d\n\nAnd overcoming trust issues that lingered after the Fletcher drama wasn\u2019t easy, either.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, I was really angry for being blindsided,\u201d said Bushnell. \u201cAnd that resentment and anger affected our relationship much longer than it should have.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the two always maintained they were \u201cnot in any rush\u201d to tie the knot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both ready to get married, but we haven\u2019t set a date because we want to make sure we\u2019re not doing it for anyone but ourselves,\u201d said Bushnell.\n\n\u201cWe just want to do it on our own terms,\u201d added Higgins. \u201cI just want to look over at Lauren and know that she is completely filled with joy in that moment. \u2026 Love is what life is all about.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fben-lauren-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fben-lauren-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Dugan", "Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/bachelor-ben-higgins-lauren-bushnell-split/", "title": "Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell Split: Bachelor Couple Breaks Off Engagement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Ben Higgins,Breakups,Couples,Exclusive,Lauren Bushnell,News,The Bachelor,TV", "news_keywords": "Ben Higgins,Breakups,Couples,Exclusive,Lauren Bushnell,News,The Bachelor,TV", "description": "Higgins and Bushnell got engaged on the season 20 finale of The Bachelor in March 2016", "og": {"title": "Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell Split: Bachelor Couple Breaks Off Engagement", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/bachelor-ben-higgins-lauren-bushnell-split/", "description": "Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell have called it quits. \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we announce our decision to go our separate ways,\u201d they&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fben-lauren-1.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 942}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/bachelor-ben-higgins-lauren-bushnell-split/", "description": "Higgins and Bushnell got engaged on the season 20 finale of The Bachelor in March 2016", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fben-lauren-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/bachelor-ben-higgins-lauren-bushnell-split/", "title": "Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell Split: Bachelor Couple Breaks Off Engagement", "description": "Higgins and Bushnell got engaged on the season 20 finale of The Bachelor in March 2016", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fben-lauren-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
