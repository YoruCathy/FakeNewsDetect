{"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/10/04/fast-furious-9-delayed/", "text": "Fast and Furious 9 type Movie\n\nThe Fate of the Furious earned more than $1 billion earlier this year, continuing the Fast franchise\u2019s streak of box office success. Universal had scheduled two further Furious films for April 2019 and April 2021, but we\u2019ll now have to wait a little longer for the next ones.\n\nEW has confirmed that the ninth film in the franchise has been delayed a year, with a new release date set for April 10, 2020. That is right in the middle of the presidential primary season, so keep that in mind if/when Dwayne Johnson actually decides to run for political office, America. (Never forget: Terminator 3 came out in theaters a few months before Arnold Schwarzenegger became Governor of California.)\n\nThe eighth Fast film\u2019s release was marked by rumors of behind-the-scenes drama among the costars. Then longtime franchise star Michelle Rodriguez threatened to leave the franchise via Instagram. And then eternal optimist Tyrese Gibson also took to Instagram, apparently to kindly request that Johnson not delay Fast 9. (Johnson had long teased the possibility of a spin-off for his character, Hobbs \u2013 a project that could theoretically delay a mainline Fast film.)\n\nPlot details about the ninth film have been kept under wraps, and there\u2019s no official word on any franchise spin-offs. The Fate of the Furious was nominally the beginning of a new Fast trilogy, introducing Charlize Theron\u2019s Cipher as an antagonist who could return in a future film. No word yet on what the ninth film is titled, so let\u2019s stop restraining ourselves and just list all the possible titles:\n\nThe Facts of the Furious\n\nThe Fury of the Fast\n\nFa9t (but with a cool font where only the part of the \u201c9\u201d that is shaped vaguely like an \u201cS\u201d is illuminated, you can see if you look closely)\n\nThe Fall of the Furious\n\nNine Fast So Furious\n\nThe Past of the Furious (origin story)\n\nFinal Furious: The Beginning\n\nThe Fast and the Furious: Verone\u2019s Vengeance\n\nThe Fast and the Furious but with Motorcycles", "images":
