The coaches this season, veterans Adam Levine and Blake Shelton as well as rookie Clarkson and season 12 winner Alicia Keys, can only use their block buttons on one artist for the entire first round of the competition. When a coach hits the block button with the name of the other three coaches, the coach who hit it automatically turns around. The \u201cblocked\u201d coach only discovers they are blocked if they press their button. If the coach doesn\u2019t press their button, the block is still available for another audition.\n\n\u201cYou have to do it based on voice alone, so [we] really kept the sanctity of the blind audition with that,\u201d Morrissey says.\n\nSeason 14 of the show will also introduce a save button that will allow a coach to save an artist they just eliminated during the knockout round. However, if another coach presses his or her steal button, the contestant can then decide if they want to go to a new team or return to their former coach.\n\n\u201cThe coaches love that because there was jeopardy. People didn\u2019t necessarily go back to the [team] they had been on,\u201d Morrissey says.\n\nWhile these new competition elements promise to shake up the dynamic between the coaches, so does Clarkson\u2019s presence. Although she previously served as a mentor for Shelton\u2019s team, now she is joining the family full-time.\n\nChloe Kohanski, who started off as a self-proclaimed \u201cAmericana\u201d artist in season 13 but feels she developed a more \u201c\u201980s iconic rock persona\u201d that led her to win the season, says she has been inspired by careers like Clarkson\u2019s and previous \u201cVoice\u201d coach Jennifer Hudson \u2014 which were launched by a singing competition show. (Clarkson won the debut season of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d on Fox, while Hudson came in seventh during \u201cIdol\u2019s\u201d third season.)\n\n\u201cThe mentality of this industry is that you have to shoot for the stars. You want the dream. You want to be a star. You shoot for that. But, there\u2019s so many beautiful places you can land even if you\u2019re not a star. You can sing for a living every day for the rest of your life. That\u2019s pretty beautiful to me,\u201d Kohanski says, noting that the contestants come into the show with talent, but the show provides the all-important exposure.\n\nKohanski also notes \u201cThe Voice\u201d develops important relationships between the contestants and their coaches that extend beyond the season.\n\n\u201cIf I felt like I needed advice, or if I felt like I needed a favor, I would not hesitate to text or call [my former coach Blake],\u201d Kohanski says of working on her original music now. \u201cIt\u2019s a very real, organic relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Voice\u201d season 14 premieres Feb. 26 at 8 p.m. on NBC.\n\nWatch a preview of \u201cThe Voice\u201d season 14 below.", "images":
