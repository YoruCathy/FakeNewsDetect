The 21 year-old Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel quickly denied it that it was her in the picture though (it turns out it was Chantel Jeffries).\n\nBut now, only two months later, she back locking lips with the 28 year-old Canadian.\n\nIn a fan-snapped photograph, uploaded onto Instagram, we can see the pair together, apparently at a screening of Ash Is Purest White on Friday night at the annual film festival.\n\nAnd, remember, she isn\u2019t the only Hadid girl taking a romantic trip down memory lane - her elder sister Gigi has been spotted smooching her One Directioner ex out on the streets of Manhattan of late.\n\nHey, there ain't no shame in returning to pastures old, sometimes you don't know what you've got until it's gone.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/3200x1600/landscape-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-513147416-1526024834.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bella-hadid-lead-1525965527.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.154xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bella-hadid-red-dress-1526213325.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/3200x1600/landscape-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daisy Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a20678562/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-cannes/", "title": "Bella Hadid And \u2018Ex\u2019 The Weeknd Spotted Together Again At Cannes And There Are Pictures To Prove It", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Have Been Spotted Together Again At Cannes And OMG It's So Back On", "description": "Dun dun dunnnnn", "url": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a20678562/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-cannes/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/3200x1600/landscape-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-05-14 02:32:55", "published_time": "2018-05-14 02:32:00", "section": "Life + Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/3200x1600/landscape-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Bella Hadid And \u2018Ex\u2019 The Weeknd Spotted Together Again At Cannes And There Are Pictures To Prove It", "description": "Dun dun dunnnnn", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/2560x2560/square-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-14T14:32:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/3200x1600/landscape-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/2560x2560/square-1511434190-bella-drake.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Have Been Spotted Together Again At Cannes And OMG It's So Back On", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526236320.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
