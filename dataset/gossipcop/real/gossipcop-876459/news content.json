The 34-year-old actress may be on holiday, but her DIY beauty routine is still on point \u2014 and Stylish is into it.\n\nAbout Last Night: See the Best-Dressed Stars on the Red Carpet and Beyond Beauty DNA: Five Secrets to Stealing Kate Bosworth\u2019s Ethereal Beauty Style See Zendaya Cover Her Acne Scars, Get That No-Makeup Makeup Look\n\nLuckily for Us, the fashion plate took some of her downtime to share her holiday beauty routine in an Instagram story on Saturday, August 26 \u2014 just in time to inspire our packing for the upcoming holiday weekend. The key theme to the whole routine? Ease.\n\nThese Are The Shoes You\u2019ll Want to Update Your Fall Wardrobe\n\nBosworth demonstrated the super-snappy routine she concocted for a coral flush and lip, which starts with RMS Beauty Lip2Cheek Tint in Sacred ($36). The Blue Crush star recorded herself dabbing the cream blush on the apples of her cheeks, enhancing her sun-kissed flush, which coordinated with her true coral lipstick.\n\nThe former TopShop designer kept the rest of her look pared down with Chanel Illusion D\u2019Ombre Velvet eyeshadow ($36) in the shade Melody (#beachvibes), a warm and muted sand hue, which she described as \u201cgorgeous and easy to use.\u201d\n\nTo add structure to her look, Bosworth employed the fan-favorite Glossier Boy Brow ($16) to groom her thick brows. The Art of More star noted in her story that the letters were faded on her tube because it was so well-loved. She also used Glossier Haloscope ($22) on her cheekbones, dubbing the creamy and shimmering illuminator the \u201cbest dewy highlighter hands down.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering whether or not Bosworth\u2019s glow was the result of fun in the sun, she had a little help. The model-actress shared that she used Charlotte Tilbury Healthy Glow Hydrating Shimmer Tint ($40), saying that it\u2019s a great choice not only because it\u2019s unisex, but because you can use it when you want a tan or if you already have a bit of a tan.\n\nCelebs Are Loving This Bedazzled Take on Birkenstocks\n\nBosworth finished her look with Charlotte Tilbury Legendary Lashes Mascara ($32) to give her a wide-eyed look, and applied Tilbury\u2019s shimmering body illuminator Supermodel Body Highlighter ($65) to give her limbs extra sheen.\n\nTell Us: What do you think of Bosworth\u2019s
