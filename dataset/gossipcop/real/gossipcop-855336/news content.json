Showtime\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d picks up the story of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) 25 years later, and attempts to be an homage, a sequel, and a standalone story. The unique nature of this revival is overshadowed by the fact that the show itself was always a surprising, weird gem in the otherwise predictable stable of broadcast television programming. It\u2019s hard to know whether it is more surprising that \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d ever existed or caught in the first place, or that 27 years after its cancellation, it has returned on premium cable with so much of the original cast and crew preserved. Lynch brought auteur-ish filmmaking to television, which elevated the medium for many viewers. Now its most prestigious, high-minded arm has brought him back. And it has the marketing blitz to prove it.\n\nThis is a long way of saying that it is difficult to know where to begin with Showtime\u2019s \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d which premiered its first two parts Sunday night. Fans of Lynch \u2014 and fans of the series, who have mythologized its idiosyncratic details over the last two decades \u2014 will take in the director\u2019s vision with open arms, savoring its bizarre iconography and nonlinear storytelling. They will undoubtedly find a lot to be happy with in this two-hour premiere, which is parts 1 and 2 of \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d (though there is no clear delineation between parts). Lynch, who directed the episode and co-wrote it with Mark Frost, begins with the Black Lodge, which he explored extensively in the second-season finale and in \u201cTwin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,\u201d the prequel film. The new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d uses grounding footage from the old \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d to establish some of the basics of the mythology: Cooper is stuck in the Lodge while his doppelg\u00e4nger \u2014 inhabited by Bob (Frank Silva), an evil spirit \u2014 is in the world. Lynch, throughout \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d is at his absolute best in Black Lodge scenes, and there is a bit of relief in seeing that even in this Showtime interpretation, the Black Lodge is still eerie and destabilizing.\n\nAt the same time, the Black Lodge is also where one of the first obvious differences between the old and new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d emerges: the simple fact of production values. Much of the odd, creepy charm of the original \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d was that Lynch was shoehorning his bizarre vision into a murder arc of a soap opera \u2014 with its interminable pacing, melodramatic music, and small-town archetypal characters. Part of that mood was a low-budget sensibility, which translated to artfully deliberate poor quality. It\u2019s one of the reasons \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is so aesthetically unique. But Showtime gave David Lynch nearly carte blanche for this new production, and as a result, it really doesn\u2019t have that low-budget patina. The production values make for immersive, textured shots of the woods around the town of Twin Peaks \u2014 sometimes, the trees seem like more fleshed-out characters than the minor characters they are partially obscuring, and Lynch sometimes films unfolding scenes as if the viewer is just another character in a video game. But for every moment that feels fascinating in a new way, there is self-indulgence. The bankable popularity of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d also makes for an inexplicably stupid scene at the Bang Bang where the indie-electronic band Chromatics performs to a room of middle-aged townies taking tequila shots. Nothing says rural, small-town, faded glory like an impossibly cool synthpop band. Could it be possible that sometimes, network notes are a good thing?\n\nThe finest scenes of the new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d occur nowhere near Twin Peaks at all. In New York City \u2014 introduced in a swooping series of shots that feel like how an animated comic-book show would take us to the villain\u2019s \u201cHQ\u201d \u2014 a man is watching, and filming, a glass box. It has a circular aperture that looks out onto the city from its high perch at the top of a skyscraper. And opposite the glass box is a couch, with two tasteful lamps and an end table. Sam\u2019s job is to see if anything appears inside the box. If you watched \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d while sitting on a couch, you may have noticed that just as you watched a glass box waiting for something to happen, the box \u2014 and the man on it \u2014 watched you in return. That the box then erupts with something unnameably evil \u2014 just at the moment, of course, when Sam (Ben Rosenfield) is distracted by the charms of Tracey (Madeline Zima). Their violent, brutal death is not quite the type of gore that \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d is known for, but that\u2019s what made it so interesting. The show\u2019s aesthetic is typically fuzzy. But the glossy box gleams in its careful lighting, and in the middle the aperture is a perfect circle, an eye unto the world. The unnameable evil, when it emerges, is like a creature constructed of white noise, a blurry bit of static. It is terrifying.\n\nA little less terrifying is what has become of Cooper\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger \u2014 let\u2019s just call him Evil Cooper. He is in Buckhorn, South Dakota, and he looks like a washed-up rocker from the \u201880s who never realized the party ended. MacLachlan is doused in spray tan and wearing snakeskin; Lynch\u2019s manifestation of evil appears to be a guy wearing leather with a half-ponytail. The effect is kind of ludicrously seedy, and MacLachlan is a little uncomfortable there; he\u2019s better in the moments where he is called on to emote silently while trapped in the Black Lodge. At the same time, Evil Cooper isn\u2019t just a joke: In the back half of the episode, he kills Darya (Nicole LaLiberte) with close-range, heartless violence. Evil Cooper is creating mayhem for Bill Hastings (Matthew Lillard), who is beginning to have an arc that looks like Leland Palmer\u2019s (Ray Wise) \u2014 he dreamed committing an awful murder that turns out to have been real. Evil Cooper follows his wife home, and then kills her with her lover\u2019s gun, saying: \u201cYou did good. You followed human nature perfectly.\u201d\n\nHuman nature sometimes seems like it is the furthest thing from Lynch\u2019s mind. \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d contains several long shots that reduce its characters to just tiny figures in a vast landscape. And yet even amidst the new surrealities of the Black Lodge (the Arm is now a tree with a brain!?) its most meaningless stretches continue to delight him. \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d attention to the most bathetic moments of human existence is strangely comforting, even as a comedy of manners in an apartment complex\u2019s anonymous hallway gives way, with one twisted doorknob, into a ritualistic horror show. Lynch and Frost have doubled their cast in \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return,\u201d out of apparent curiosity for how all of these people live. It\u2019s at times a confounding amount of detail; late in the two-hour episode, when Jennifer Jason Leigh turns out to have been next door the whole time, the scale of what this reboot is trying to accomplish is both daunting and a little maddening.\n\n\u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d is weird and creepy and slow. But it is interesting. The show is very stubbornly itself \u2014 not quite film and not quite TV, rejecting both standard storytelling and standard forms. It\u2019s not especially fun to watch and it can be quite disturbing. But there is never a sense that you are watching something devoid of vision or intention. Lynch\u2019s vision is so total and absolute that he can get away with what wouldn\u2019t be otherwise acceptable .", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Funcategorized%2Ftv-review-twin-peaks-the-return-showtime-1202439500%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202439500&comment_count=52", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/rr-20768-r.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/rr-20768-r.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sonia Saraiya"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/uncategorized/tv-review-twin-peaks-the-return-showtime-1202439500/", "title": "TV Review: David Lynch\u2019s \u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "David Lynch returns to the small screen in Showtime's reboot, which confounds and indulges but still communicates astonishing vision", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202439500, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-05-21T22:04:26"}, "pmc-tag": "David Lynch,Twin Peaks,twin peaks: the return", "title": "TV Review: David Lynch\u2019s \u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TV Review: David Lynch\u2019s \u2018Twin Peaks: The Return\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/uncategorized/tv-review-twin-peaks-the-return-showtime-1202439500/", "description": "The stature of \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d David Lynch\u2019s two-season surreal murder mystery that ran on ABC in the early \u201890s, is such that its modern-day reboot almost defies interpretation.
