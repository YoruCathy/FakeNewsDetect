Sketch With Jimmy Fallon\n\nThe laughter-filled prank was a fun, feel-good segment to celebrate \"Miley Week,\" a noticeable contrast to the singer's appearance on Monday's episode, where she opened the show with a powerful rendition of Dido's \"No Freedom.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old pop star was joined by Adam Sandler on guitar, and the pair dedicated the emotional performance to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting on Sunday.\n\nWATCH: Chris Pratt and Chris Evans Photobomb Unsuspecting Super Bowl Fans, Hilarity Ensues\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first time Cyrus and Fallon have surprised random people for a bit on the late night talk show. Back in June, the pair went undercover, in full disguise, as street musicians in a New York City subway station.\n\nWhile the pair were somewhat unrecognizable, Cyrus' flawless soulful cover of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" attracted a lot of attention and soon the pair revealed themselves. Check out the video below for a look at the impressive stunt.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAA=", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Zach Seemayer\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ"}, "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, Miley Cyrus, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgxO_WLSiMM?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
