The Real Housewives of Orange County star, 49, already opened up to Andy Cohen during Monday\u2019s Watch What Happens Live about her recent facelift.\n\n\n\nMORE: 'RHOC' Star Tamra Judge Enjoys Pool Time With Her Granddaughter Ava -- See the Cute Pic!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd on Wednesday, she took to Instagram to share some post-surgery photos with her fans and to explain some of the work she got done.\n\n\u201cThese pics were taking all within the first week,\u201d she wrote of the images, which show her bandaged face. \u201cYes I was scared s**tless! But I've seen Dr. Ambe's work on my Mom and knew I was in good hands. I wanted a very natural look and it's exactly what he's known for.\u201d\n\nThough she admitted to having staples in her face, Judge noted \u201cthere was little pain and bruising,\u201d but that she had to stay still for two weeks after. That doesn\u2019t mean the process was without complications.\n\n\u201cOn day 12 I got the stomach flu which sucked! Today it's been 17 days and I feel great, my neck is still stiff and my ears and jawline are slightly swollen and numb,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat will all change in a few weeks. Incisions are behind my ear and hairline, under my chin... I'm open and honest about it because I want women to know that everyone gets old even people on TV and there is nothing wrong with growing old gracefully if that's what you want...... It's just not for me! I like to keep it real! #lowerfacelift #eyetuck. #callitacomeback.\u201d\n\nJudge told Cohen that she got the work done in honor of her 10th anniversary on the Bravo reality series.\n\n\u201cI call it a comeback. I don\u2019t call it a facelift,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my Season 13 tagline.\u201d\n\nMORE: EXCLUSIVE: \u2018The Real Housewives of Orange County\u2019 Season 12 Taglines Are Here -- Watch!\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge noted that since she\u2019s lost weight competing in body building competitions, her skin hasn\u2019t been as firm, so she visited the doctor to get some work done.\n\n\u201cAndy, this is my 10-year anniversary on the show!
