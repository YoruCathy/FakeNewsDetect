Engaging, disturbing, and heartbreaking, these characters spread across seven seasons of Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's horror anthology series and regularly do everything in their power to hurt each other.\n\nThe upcoming eighth season, American Horror Story: Apocalypse, will be a mashup of the series' two most popular seasons, Murder House (Season 1) and Coven (Season 3), and bring those season's favorite characters to the forefront once again. Like a fanfiction come to fruition, Apocalypse is bound to feature some incredibly meta character moments. In honor of this fandom dream come true, we thought we'd rank our favorites (some of which will appear again in Apocalypse).\n\nWe'd apologize for so much of this list consisting of Jessica Lange characters, but we're not sorry. Lange is the queen of American Horror Story, a pillar of the series whose absence is sorely felt when she's not grinning sadistically out of your television. Other series mainstays include Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters, both of whom have a place (or two) on this list, because they are also awesome.\n\nHere they are, the Top 10 AHS characters of all time, ranked.", "images": ["https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/syfywire_blog_post/2018/09/rs-170892-ahs_0094_hires2_1.jpg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/hamburger--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/close--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/watch--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/search--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680_hero/public/syfywire_blog_post/2018/09/rs-170892-ahs_0094_hires2_1.jpg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/SYFYWire_Logo.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/loading-spinner.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/syfywire_blog_post/2018/09/rs-170892-ahs_0094_hires2_1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlin Busch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-top-10-american-horror-story-characters-of-all-time-ranked", "title": "The top 10 American Horror Story characters of all time, ranked", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 795894437245434}, "post_type": "syfywire_article", "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "description": "American Horror Story: The top 10 characters of all time, ranked", "keywords": "American Horror Story, American Horror Story: Apocalypse, opinion, lists, rankings", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "SYFY WIRE", "url": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-top-10-american-horror-story-characters-of-all-time-ranked", "type": "article", "title": "The top 10 American Horror Story characters of all time, ranked", "description": "Outside of flashbacks and dropped plotlines, American Horror Story is probably best known for its characters.
