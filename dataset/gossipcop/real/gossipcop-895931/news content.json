I don\u2019t even really know how to answer it, if I should, because I don\u2019t want anything to get twisted, because I have known Ed for years and know how lovely he is, and don\u2019t think he would ever put someone in a position like that,\u201d Szohr said.\n\nThe actress, who dated her co-star between 2008 and 2010, said that the accusers could be alleging things that are not true: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, because you don\u2019t want someone you know to go through that or do that to someone, or knowing them well, knowing that you don\u2019t think they would, and you don\u2019t want, for the girls that are coming forward, it\u2019s like, are they stretching the truth?\u201d\n\nDespite her defense of Westwick, the \u201cShameless\u201d actress said she\u2019s glad survivors of sexual abuse are coming forward. \u201cIt\u2019s just, it\u2019s a touchy, tough thing that you pray it\u2019s not true and that with, outside of even him, all these different topics coming up, I\u2019m glad that there\u2019s notice being put on it for women that are going through it.\u201d .\n\n\u201cBut I also think it\u2019s a touchy, crazy thing too,\u201d Szohr said, \u201cbecause some people are going into these different situations and they\u2019re not coming out true. So it\u2019s like, well, why are people making it up, because that takes away from the girls that are going through it. And then it\u2019s also hard to go back and try to get evidence from things that were so long ago.\u201d\n\nJessica confirmed that she has been in contact with Westwick, who she described as having a \u201cdifficult time\u201d: He\u2019s being accused of something that he\u2019s publicly saying he didn\u2019t do. So it\u2019s, you know, tough on him. His show got canceled.\u201d\n\nSzohr concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t know those girls at all, and they could be lovely and awesome and all that. From the Ed I know and working with him for five years and having a friendship through all of that and after, it was shocking. It was shocking.\u201d\n\nWestwick denied the accusations made by Kristina Cohen via Twitter. \u201cI do not know this woman,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.\u201d\n\nLAPD confirmed that they are conducting an investigation on Cohen\u2019s claims and the BBC canceled the upcoming Agatha Christie special \u201cOrdeal by Innocence\u201d, starring the British actor, and halted production on the second season of his series\u2019 \u201cWhite Gold\u201d.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nOlivia Munn, Natasha Henstridge and More
