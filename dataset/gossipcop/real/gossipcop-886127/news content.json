He was wild but so so so sweet,\u201d the Port Orchard, Washington-based star, 57, recalls of raising son Zack (one of her three biological children, the other 10 were welcomed through adoption).\n\nImage zoom Courtesy of Delilah\n\nAnd like his mom, Zack, who was a senior in high school, had the gift of compassion. \u201cHe was a faithful friend to the outcast and the troubled. Dozens of his friends have written to me and told me he was like a counselor to them,\u201d says Delilah, adding that in the wake of his death, the mom of one of his friends reached out saying \u201che saved her daughter\u2019s life when she was battling depression and anorexia, insisting the girl tell her folks and going with her to do that.\u201d\n\nHis own struggle began recently, following a December 2016 car accident. \u201cThe event traumatized him,\u201d she says. A painful breakup and an illness followed suit and soon Zack found himself behind in school.\n\n\u201cWhen he found out he wouldn\u2019t graduate he spiraled into depression, and was honest about it,\u201d says his mom, who quickly \u201cfound him doctors, a fabulous counselor and support group.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Courtesy of Delilah\n\nJust before the end, \u201cHe was doing so well,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was looking forward to making up his missed credits, graduating and starting film school. He was fascinated with science fiction and time travel and began to talk about the book A Wrinkle in Time and quantum physics.\u201d\n\nWhile Delilah declines to share the manner of his death, she says Zack left behind a message. \u201cHis goodbye note did not mention sadness, anger, angst or depression, just a pressing madness about feeling like this world was not his home.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s devastated,\u201d says Delilah\u2019s rep. This is yet another round of sadness for the radio star, who after struggles with her own parents and three failed marriages, wed business owner Paul Warner in 2012. That same year she lost 16-year-old son Sammy to complications from sickle cell anemia.\n\nImage zoom Delilah Instagram\n\nNow, with Zack\u2019s passing, she\u2019s taking a leave of absence from her radio show to mourn and turning towards her husband, family and millions of listeners for comfort. Says the rep, \u201cThe lady who is there for everyone else every single night now needs our love and our prayers sent right back to her.\u201d\n\nFor more on Delilah\u2019s painful loss, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\nSuicide Prevention: What to Know\n\nExperts say some common warning signs of suicide include discussing a desire to die or feeling anxious or hopeless, like a burden, or trapped or in pain; withdrawing from others; extreme mood swings, including anger and recklessness; and abnormal sleep patterns (sleeping too much or too little).\n\nMany suicides have multiple causes and are not triggered by one event, according to experts, who underline that suicidal crises can be overcome with help. Where mental illness is a factor, it can be treated.\n\nReaching out to those in need is a simple and effective preventative measure, experts say.\n\nIf you or someone you know is showing warning signs of suicide, consider contacting the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK, texting the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or seeking help from a professional.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-3-2000a-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fdeliliah-vacation-2000-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-2-2000a-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1988&h=1041&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-1-2000a-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1988&h=1041&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-1-2000a-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janine Rubenstein"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/delilah-radio-child-suicide-breaks-silence-goodbye-note/", "title": "Delilah Opens Up About Son's Suicide and Heartbreaking Goodbye Note", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celeb Moms Get Real,Death,Delilah,Exclusive,Music News,News,Suicide", "news_keywords": "Celeb Moms Get Real,Death,Delilah,Exclusive,Music News,News,Suicide", "description": "Popular romance radio host and mom of 13, Delilah says her teen son suffered from depression but was a \"counselor\" to other friends in need", "og": {"title": "Delilah Opens Up About Son's Suicide and Heartbreaking Goodbye Note", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/delilah-radio-child-suicide-breaks-silence-goodbye-note/", "description": "The velvety voice of Delilah Rene Luke is known far and wide for offering life-learned advice to her 8.3 million late-night listeners, but now the&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1988&h=1041&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-1-2000a-2000.jpg", "width": 1988, "height": 1041}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/delilah-radio-child-suicide-breaks-silence-goodbye-note/", "description": "Popular romance radio host and mom of 13, Delilah says her teen son suffered from depression but was a \"counselor\" to other friends in need", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-1-2000a-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/delilah-radio-child-suicide-breaks-silence-goodbye-note/", "title": "Delilah Opens Up About Son's Suicide and Heartbreaking Goodbye Note", "description": "Popular romance radio host and mom of 13, Delilah says her teen son suffered from depression but was a \"counselor\" to other friends in need", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1988&h=1041&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdeliliah-zack-1-2000a-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
