Listen to what he said in the video above!\n\n\u201cFirst time I was ever in Vegas I got married, which didn\u2019t turn out that well,\u201d Hunnam, 37, said. \u201cI had known the girl for three weeks. We had fallen madly in love and it was the first time I had ever been in love.\u201d\n\nThe pair decided to elope before Hunnam, then 18, had to head back home to England. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What if we never see each other again? Let\u2019s get married and then we\u2019ll have to see each other again even if it\u2019s just to get divorced,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo we came to Vegas, but I couldn\u2019t even get a drink so I actually didn\u2019t think I would be able to get married.\u201d\n\nBut anything goes in Sin City. At 2 A.M., Hunnam and Towne said \u201cI do\u201d in front of Silver Bell Wedding Chapel\u2019s Reverend RJ Cotton. (They wanted to get married by Elvis but \u201che left the building,\u201d joked Hunnam.)\n\nThe end result: \u201cThree terrible years,\u201d admitted Hunnam, whose divorce was finalized in 2002. \u201cThree terrible, painful, expensive years. I got the cats at the end of it, so that was good. There was a small victory.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s since gone on to find success in his 12-year relationship with jewelry designer Morgana McNelis. The pair reside in a $2.76 million Hollywood Hills pad that likely sees a lot of action. After all, The Lost City of Z star recently reveled he stays in shape by having tons of sex, among other activities.\n\n\u201cI try to do it all. I also try to make love as often as I can. That\u2019s an important part of fitness. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t be active at 70. I want to run up mountains at that age,\u201d Hunnam told Men\u2019s Health. \u201cWe are supposed to be very active animals. It\u2019s our DNA. Sweating is how I change my oil every day. I just feel happier, more positive, energized, and disciplined if I work out.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-6bd66f0a-ec47-41ec-aab3-040493577bad.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-cfacca3f-7a8d-4415-b43d-12d022dc10df.jpg?crop=1px%2C42px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/595055034_katharine-towne-zoom-555e2d05-4dfc-412b-9edd-ac3a75b06d81.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/146537637_charlie-hunnam-morgana-mcnelis-zoom-82129850-2d4d-4bab-833c-385c1e5c66db.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-cfacca3f-7a8d-4415-b43d-12d022dc10df.jpg?crop=1px%2C42px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jamie Blynn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlie-hunnam-on-terrible-painful-three-year-marriage-w477225/", "title": "Charlie Hunnam on 'Terrible, Painful' Three-Year Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "In a recent interview with The AP, Charlie Hunnam recalled marrying actress Katharine Towne at just 18 years old in 1999", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Charlie Hunnam Recalls 'Terrible, Painful' Three-Year Marriage", "description": "In a recent interview with The AP, Charlie Hunnam recalled marrying actress Katharine Towne at just 18 years old in 1999", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlie-hunnam-on-terrible-painful-three-year-marriage-w477225/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:14:38+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-cfacca3f-7a8d-4415-b43d-12d022dc10df.jpg?crop=1px%2C42px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-cfacca3f-7a8d-4415-b43d-12d022dc10df.jpg?crop=1px%2C42px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-17T18:02:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:14:38+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In a recent interview with The AP, Charlie Hunnam recalled marrying actress Katharine Towne at just 18 years old in 1999", "title": "Charlie Hunnam Recalls 'Terrible, Painful' Three-Year Marriage", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-cfacca3f-7a8d-4415-b43d-12d022dc10df.jpg?crop=1px%2C42px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492452120.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
