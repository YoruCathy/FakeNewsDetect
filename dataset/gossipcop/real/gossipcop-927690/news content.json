DeGeneres teamed up with Lowe\u2019s to give the largest gift in her show\u2019s history to Texas\u2019 own Rockport-Fulton High School. The gift was revealed in a segment on DeGeneres\u2019 popular syndicated daytime TV show.\n\nThe money will be used to rebuild the high school\u2019s Harvey destroyed gym. It means the world to Rockport-Fulton\u2019s student-athletes.\n\n\u201cI spend more time in that gym than I do at home,\u201d senior volleyball player Allison Sanders said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \u201cLosing it was devastating.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Watt \u2014 the man who raised $37 million for Hurricane Harvey relief \u2014 weighed in with his own gushing praise for DeGeneres.\n\nLast August, DeGeneres committed $50,000 of her own money to Harvey relief and presented a $1 million check from Walmart to J.J. Watt\u2019s fundraising efforts.\n\nWhen the Category 4 storm made landfall in Rockport on August 25, Aransas County ISD suffered some of the most devastating damage of any of the Texas school districts. The eye of the storm passed directly over Rockport. The area was severely impacted, with $55 million in damages. Rockport-Fulton is the only high school in the town \u2014 and its gym nicknamed Gold Gym was leveled by the storm.\n\nDeGeneres surprised the high school\u2019s students on her show after playing a special video. Five Rockport-Fulton girl volleyball players shared their painful stories and commitment to helping their community.\n\n\u201cThe moment I realized how bad it was when we got pictures of our gym and realized it was just everywhere. It was like a second home for us, and to see it destroyed was so devastating,\u201d one student said.\n\nScenes of the girls playing volleyball were mixed in with Harvey footage, both of the storm itself and the entire town banding together to rebuild.\n\n\u201cBecause Rockport is such a tight-knit community, I think the need to help was so much greater,\u201d one student said in the video. It was that resiliency and determination that caught DeGeneres\u2019 eye. Student Sydney Macha first contacted the show\u2019s producers. Skype meetings with the program heads kicked off in February.\n\nAfter the video played, DeGeneres revealed that the high school students and volleyball coaches had gathered in the middle school. They believed they would be recording for Ellentube. You could say they were in for a surprise.\n\nDeGeneres recognized that the significance of the high school gym to all of Rockport\u2019s resilient citizens. \u201cI know that your gym was more than a gym to you,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt was important to your entire community.\u201d\n\nThe volleyball players updated DeGeneres on Rockport\u2019s progress, some through tears and others nervous about speaking to the celebrity. \u201cIt\u2019s Ellen!\u201d one laughed. She described the situation, with people still displaced eight months later and many out of jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have our friends, we have our family, we have our team. So we\u2019re OK.\u201d\n\nBut OK wasn\u2019t good enough for DeGeneres. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love. I mean you\u2019ve lost so much and yet everyone overcame together to help the community,\u201d she said. Right before the commercial break, the host teased that she had a big announcement.\n\nAs soon as the break was over, DeGeneres revealed the $1 million gift. The gym erupted in cheers, with students jumping up and down with joy as green and white confetti poured down \u2014 Rockport-Fulton\u2019s school colors.\n\nWith the donation, Lowe\u2019s Heroes from stores in the area will help build a new gym. Soon, it\u2019ll be good as Gold.", "images": ["https://3q87le1gsko01ibim33e4wib-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://3q87le1gsko01ibim33e4wib-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/300x120.jpg", "https://padmin.papercitymag.com/assets/useradds/logos/ulterre-logo-min.png?1560466079254", "https://3q87le1gsko01ibim33e4wib-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ellen-degeneres-love.jpg", "https://3q87le1gsko01ibim33e4wib-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1200x150.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://3q87le1gsko01ibim33e4wib-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Gallay"], "canonical_link": "https://www.papercitymag.com/culture/ellen-degeneres-donates-one-million-hurricane-harvey-devastated-high-school-rockport-surprise/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Donates $1 Million to Hurricane Harvey Devastated High School: Its Students Are Floored by the Surprise \u2014 and Even J.J.
