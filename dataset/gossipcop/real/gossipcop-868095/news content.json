But rarely does it make a food magazine website's headline news. Until now! Because Prince William and Duchess Kate have added a twist to their travels\u2014and a salty one at that.\n\nAfter their arrival in Germany, the royal couple were treated to a class in hand-rolling pretzels at a market in Heidelberg, because if you went to Germany and didn't learn how to make a pretzel, what's the point? Dressed in a bright yellow Jenny Packham lace dress and a golden-pretzel-branded apron, Kate dove right in, while it took Wills a bit longer to catch on. Has she made pretzels (a complicated, days long, sort of dangerous process that can involve lye) before? Probably not, but she was rolling with the best of them.\n\nIt seemed everyone, including the many spectators and local bakers who came to help/watch, had a great time laughing and rolling, rolling and laughing, clapping for Prince William when he finally was able to untangle himself from the dough and present his carb-filled masterpiece. It was a photo op, after all. The couple later got a lesson in making candy, which seemed to fare a bit better. See below for Prince William and Kate Middleton Prepare Local Foods: a story in four parts.\n\nChris Jackson - Pool/Getty Images\n\nFrom the start, you can see the look in Prince William's eyes that says: Oh no. I'm not wearing the right hat for this.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nKate throws her head back in a triumphant laugh\u2014notice how literally everyone else in the photo is looking at her, except for the second guy from the right, who sees William, and appears to pity him.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe struggle is real. Meanwhile, Kate contemplates a life of professional pretzel-making. She lets out a laugh\u2014oh right, the aprons! She reconsiders.\n\nChris Jackson - Pool/Getty Images\n\nHooray, the photo op is over and does anyone even get to eat the pretzels? We're left with so many questions.\n\nSort of related: All the times the Queen saw cake and LOVED it\n\nPretzel recipes, because why not?", "images": ["https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57af73171b33404414975dc9/4:3/w_640%2Cc_limit/sweet-pretzels.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543942a20318cc3be3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819302118.jpg", "https://www.bonappetit.com/verso/static/bon-appetit/assets/logo-header.29b3f7bcdadf3b208a05a3ab761757ab663c1e12.svg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/pretzels.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543bb08317780071a6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819298812.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57ad567053e63daf11a4de1e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/man-bun.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543942a20318cc3be4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819298624.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543bb08317780071a7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819298996.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57afb98ff1c801a1038bd396/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ba-party-mix.jpg", "https://www.bonappetit.com/verso/static/bon-appetit/assets/logo-reverse.adafbb9b583b565c29b99cfbd36ab80f108eac59.svg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57bf2e266a6acdf3485df71f/4:3/w_640%2Cc_limit/queen-cake-1989.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57afba7e1b33404414975e3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/everything-cookies.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Minton", "Melissa Minto", "Elyssa Goldberg", "Alex Beggs"], "canonical_link": "http://www.glamour.com/story/kate-middleton-prince-william-pretzel-rolling", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Hand-Rolled Pretzels in Germany", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Melissa Minton", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "During their recent royal trip to Germany, Prince William and Duchess Kate Middleton learned from local bakers how to prepare pretzels.", "id": "59710b543942a20318cc3be5", "keywords": "pop-culture,snd,royals,trends + news,people", "news_keywords": "pop-culture,snd,royals,trends + news,people", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59710b543942a20318cc3be5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"During their recent royal trip to Germany, Prince William and Duchess Kate Middleton learned from local bakers how to prepare pretzels.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/pretzels.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/pretzels.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "As one does.", "image": "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg", "site_name": "Bon App\u00e9tit", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton Rolled Pretzels in Germany", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.glamour.com/story/kate-middleton-prince-william-pretzel-rolling"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bonappetit", "description": "As one does.", "domain": "https://www.bonappetit.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@bonappetit", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton Rolled Pretzels in Germany"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2309869772, "pages": 37940325366}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bonappetit.com", "summary": ""}
