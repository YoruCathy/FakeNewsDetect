News. \"He's called me several times with a private number and verbally assaulting us and threatening us.\"\n\nA rep for Malina did not return Fox News' request for comment.\n\nHis neighbor said Malina believes he poisoned trees on the actor's property and now the \"Scandal\" won't leave his family alone. Lam claims in the complaint that Malina showed up unannounced at his house and \"verbally attacked me and my wife.\"\n\n\"Last winter he came to our door at 9pm and yelled at my wife about some tree that was cut and cursed at her \u2018You better not f--king cut my tree,'\" Lam wrote. \"He got in her face and started to come into our house.\"\n\nLam said the actor has caused his family \"tremendous stress.\"\n\nThis is the second scandal for Malina this year. The 51-year-old came under fire in August for calling Trump voters \"stupid c--ks\" on Twitter and refusing to apologize.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mafia-Hit-Man.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/09/694940094001_5536523180001_-Scandal--star-posts-expletive-filled-tweet-to-Trump-voters.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/09/931/524/694940094001_5536523180001_-Scandal--star-posts-expletive-filled-tweet-to-Trump-voters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20104012734692.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/270/152/RT-Hollywood-sign.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e4bdc6f3-8d06-4623-b934-f4a25899cb6c/dc192956-9929-4f64-abb4-d9b8827a6fac/1280x720/match/270/152/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/09/694940094001_5536523180001_-Scandal--star-posts-expletive-filled-tweet-to-Trump-voters.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "You Can Find Sasha Savitsky On Twitter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/scandals-joshua-malinas-accused-of-harassing-verbally-assaulting-neighbor", "title": "'Scandal's' Joshua Malina's accused of 'harassing,' 'verbally assaulting' neighbor", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Joshua Malina has a \"Scandal\" of his own brewing.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Sasha Savitsky", "dc.title": "'Scandal's' Joshua Malina's accused of 'harassing,' 'verbally assaulting' neighbor", "dcterms.abstract": "Joshua Malina has a \"Scandal\" of his own brewing.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Joshua Malina has a \"Scandal\" of his own brewing.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:0b38ade4-2ce4-59e4-88d5-d87bf241af6e", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-09-29", "dcterms.created": "2017-09-29T08:53:51-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-09-29T09:32:50-04:00", "og": {"title": "'Scandal's' Joshua Malina's accused of 'harassing,' 'verbally assaulting' neighbor", "description": "Joshua Malina has a \"Scandal\" of his own brewing.", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/09/694940094001_5536523180001_-Scandal--star-posts-expletive-filled-tweet-to-Trump-voters.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/scandals-joshua-malinas-accused-of-harassing-verbally-assaulting-neighbor", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "'Scandal's' Joshua Malina's accused of 'harassing,' 'verbally assaulting' neighbor", "description": "Joshua Malina has a \"Scandal\" of his own brewing.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/09/1024/512/694940094001_5536523180001_-Scandal--star-posts-expletive-filled-tweet-to-Trump-voters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/scandals-joshua-malinas-accused-of-harassing-verbally-assaulting-neighbor"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/In Court,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "incourt,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
