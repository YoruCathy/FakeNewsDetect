She told reporters after the competition that she was angry over the low scores she received.\n\n\"I'm absolutely furious,\u201d she told reporters last Friday. \u201cI absolutely left one jump on the table, but for me to put out two programs that I did at this competition as solid as I skated and to get those scores, I am furious, and I think deservedly so.\"\n\nIn her exclusive sitdown with TODAY Wednesday, the 26-year-old skater said she\u2019s had some time to process what happened and she still feels \u201creally proud\u201d of her performances, but would not take back anything she said about her reaction.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cI had worked 22 years for that moment and I had put out something that I felt so proud of.\u201d\n\nShe said seeing her scores go up \u201cwas confusing to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in that moment, when I was feeling the end of that Olympic dream, it was just heartbreaking,\u201d she added.\n\nWagner, from her Jan. 5 Free Skate performance at U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Getty Images\n\nWagner said she feels that the three women who have since been named to Team USA \u2014 Bradie Tennell, Mirai Nagasu and Karen Chen \u2014 absolutely deserved their spots.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, based on the selection criteria, they absolutely made the right call with this team,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked if she felt the judges were harder on her than the other contenders, Wagner pointed out that her scores in her second competition last week were lower than ones she had earned earlier in the season when she had been skating with injuries.\n\n\u201cI ended up where I ended up,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of experience in this sport, and I know what I consistently skate like and where I usually fall. I\u2019m allowed to question things, but question things only in relations to myself,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI think that these girls earned their spots and I am so excited to take a step back.\u201d\n\nWagner, who will be an alternate on the U.S. Olympic team, said she doesn\u2019t want to shed any doubt on the ability of the women heading to South Korea.\n\nShe nabbed a spot on the 2014 team to Sochi even though she placed fourth at the U.S. championships. Judges decided to seat her on the Olympic team based on her body of work at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the position where people have tried to take away my legitimacy for being on a team and I would never want to do that to another athlete, so I think these three girls going into the Olympics, Team USA has a great team going,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_hoda_wagner_setup_180110_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/news/ashley-wagner-furious-reaction-missing-olympics-no-regrets-t121031", "title": "Ashley Wagner on \u2018furious\u2019 reaction to missing Olympics: No regrets", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/news/ashley-wagner-furious-reaction-missing-olympics-no-regrets-t121031", "title": "Ashley Wagner on \u2018furious\u2019 reaction to missing Olympics: No regrets", "description": "\"What you see is what you get with me,\" the former Olympic bronze winner told TODAY.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/gif", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Ashley Wagner on \u2018furious\u2019 reaction to missing Olympics: No regrets", "description": "\"What you see is what you get with me,\" the former Olympic bronze winner told TODAY.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S. figure skater Ashley Wagner told TODAY she's \"heartbroken\" she's not going to Olympics but would not take back her \"furious\" reaction to judges' scores that kept her out.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_news_guth_hoda_wagner_180110_1920x1080.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515593220.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
