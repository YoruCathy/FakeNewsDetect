But that doesn't mean the late-night laughs are taking a break, too.\n\nOn Monday night, Chris Pratt took over hosting duties on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" and his hilarious duet with country crooner Chris Stapleton was everything that fans of the show, the actor, the singer or the movie \"Dirty Dancing\" could possibly want.\n\n\u201cYou know, I was actually kind of nervous to do this tonight,\" Pratt told the audience as he opened the show. \"I\u2019ve never done anything like this.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nBut he soon proved what a hosting pro he was when Stapleton joined him onstage for an almost pitch-perfect rendition of the \"Dirty Dancing\" theme, \"(I've Had) the Time of my Life.\"\n\nAnd, frankly, it looked like they did.\n\nThe duo belted out the tune with maximum emotion, and then, when just the right moment in the song came around, Stapleton said the magic words: \"Let's do the lift!\"\n\nYou know, the lift:\n\nlionsgate\n\nAnd after a couple of failed take-off attempts, they actually pulled it off.\n\nSort of.\n\nYouTube\n\nThis just-for-fun performance wasn\u2019t the first time the two Chrises shared a stage together. In October, the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" star joined the Grammy winner at a concert in Nashville to swap vocals on Stapleton's hit \"Tennessee Whiskey.\"", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301635/chris-pratt-chris_stapleton-jimmy-kimmel-live-today-171205-tease-01_9d5077848399bdbc0a7b9d908ec4743b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301635/chris-pratt-chris_stapleton-jimmy-kimmel-live-today-171205-tease-01_9d5077848399bdbc0a7b9d908ec4743b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/chris-pratt-chris-stapleton-belt-out-dirty-dancing-duet-do-t119655", "title": "Chris Pratt and Chris Stapleton belt out 'Dirty Dancing' duet \u2014 and do the lift!", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/chris-pratt-chris-stapleton-belt-out-dirty-dancing-duet-do-t119655", "title": "Chris Pratt and Chris Stapleton belt out 'Dirty Dancing' duet \u2014 and do the lift!", "description": "Their hilarious performance was everything fans of the actor, the singer or the movie could possibly want.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301635/chris-pratt-chris_stapleton-jimmy-kimmel-live-today-171205-tease-01_9d5077848399bdbc0a7b9d908ec4743b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301635/chris-pratt-chris_stapleton-jimmy-kimmel-live-today-171205-tease-01_9d5077848399bdbc0a7b9d908ec4743b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301635/chris-pratt-chris_stapleton-jimmy-kimmel-live-today-171205-tease-01_9d5077848399bdbc0a7b9d908ec4743b.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Chris Pratt and Chris Stapleton belt out 'Dirty Dancing' duet \u2014 and do the lift!", "description": "Their hilarious performance was everything fans of the actor, the singer or the movie could possibly want.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Their hilarious performance was everything fans of the actor, the singer or the movie could possibly want.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301635/chris-pratt-chris_stapleton-jimmy-kimmel-live-today-171205-tease-01_9d5077848399bdbc0a7b9d908ec4743b.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/aw-r_G7rfnU"], "publish_date": 1512496740.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
