That\u2019s why we\u2019re beyond inspired by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who recently revealed she went on a two-week \u201cmental health retreat\u201d in 2017. We understand the difficulty of being open and real about these tough issues, and we admire her candor and willingness to share her story.\n\nIn a Billboard interview published Friday, March 30th, Azalea said her friends and management team encouraged her to get help with \u201canger issues\u201d after experiencing a rough couple of years.\n\nAnd honestly, we totally get it. Around 25% of American adults struggle with some kind of mental illness, yet the stigma around these issues continues to persist. Iggy Azalea\u2019s decision to work on herself shows incredible courage, and we love how real she is about sharing the pressures of living in the spotlight.\n\nCelebrities aren\u2019t immune to the struggles of mental health issues, and there is absolutely no shame in getting help.\n\nAccording to Iggy Azalea, friend Demi Lovato helped inspire her to prioritize her own mental health. (TBH, Lovato totally inspires us too.)\n\nIt\u2019s beyond encouraging to see people like Iggy Azalea spreading the message that mental health matters.\n\nWe love the growing movement to end the stigma surrounding mental health, and Azalea\u2019s case proves that anyone can benefit from professional help, even if you\u2019re just looking for ways to deal with everyday stress or anger. It can *absolutely* change your life for the better.\n\nKeep doing you, Iggy. We\u2019re so excited to see where you go next.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F03%2F31034011%2Figgy-azalea-instagram-e1522518068408.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F03%2F31034011%2Figgy-azalea-instagram-e1522518068408.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072538/avatar-f-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F03%2F31034011%2Figgy-azalea-instagram-e1522518068408.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jandra Sutton"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/iggy-azalea-mental-health/", "title": "Iggy Azalea opened up about going on a two-week \"mental health retreat,\" and here\u2019s why her story is so important", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "celebrity,celebrity interview,celebrity interviews,celebrity news,demi lovato,female musicians,iggy azalea,mental health,mental health awareness,mental health stigma,mental illness stigma,mental well being,therapy,Celeb", "news_keywords": "celebrity,celebrity interview,celebrity interviews,celebrity news,demi lovato,female musicians,iggy azalea,mental health,mental health awareness,mental health stigma,mental illness stigma,mental well being,therapy,Celeb", "description": "Australian rapper Iggy Azalea recently revealed she sought professional help for her mental health in 2017, and her story is totally inspiring.", "og": {"title": "Iggy Azalea opened up about going on a two-week \"mental health retreat,\" and here\u2019s why her story is so important", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/iggy-azalea-mental-health/", "description": "Because mental health matters.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F03%2F31034011%2Figgy-azalea-instagram-e1522518068408.jpg", "width": 422, "height": 591}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/iggy-azalea-mental-health/", "description": "Australian rapper Iggy Azalea recently revealed she sought professional help for her mental health in 2017, and her story is totally inspiring.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F03%2F31034011%2Figgy-azalea-instagram-e1522518068408.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/iggy-azalea-mental-health/", "title": "Iggy Azalea opened up about going on a two-week \"mental health retreat,\" and here\u2019s why her story is so important", "description": "Because mental health matters.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F03%2F31034011%2Figgy-azalea-instagram-e1522518068408.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
