Caroline Wozniacki, for one, approaches both with the same attitude: \"I don't really care what other people think,\" she said in a video filmed during her totally stripped-down photoshoot for the cover of ESPN The Magazine's 2017 Body Issue.\n\nWozniacki, 26, joins several other elite athletes in gracing the cover\u2014fully nude\u2014of the ninth annual Body Issue, which hits newsstands on July 7. The super-inspiring edition of the magazine will also feature the NFL's Ezekiel Elliott and Julian Edelman, Chicago Cubs infielder Javier B\u00e1ez, NBA star Isaiah Thomas, softball's A.J. Andrews, San Jose Sharks teammates Brent Burns and Joe Thornton, WNBA MVP Nneka Ogwumike, soccer's Julie Johnston Ertz and her football player husband Zach Ertz, New Zealand rugby player Malakai Fekitoa, freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, figure skater Ashley Wagner, MMA fighter Michelle Waterson, and several members of the U.S. Women's National Hockey Team, according to ESPN.\n\nMarine Corps Sgt. Kirstie Ennis, a snowboarder and mountaineer, will also appear as the Body Issue's first-ever featured veteran, and Novlene Williams-Mills, a four-time Olympic track and field medalist from Jamaica, will be the first breast cancer survivor featured in the issue.\n\nThe yearly issue celebrates athletic achievement and highlights the grace and beauty inherent in the strength of world-class athletes. In the video from her shoot, Wozniacki talks about learning to get over her insecurities about her muscles and how she stopped comparing herself to other women who aren't professional athletes. \"I grew up to really love my body and the strength that I have,\" she said. \"Now I have a strong core, I have abs, I have a butt and I have thighs, because that's what I need to run fast and be able to sustain the power out there when I play against the other women.\" The tennis pro posted her cover on Instagram, writing, \"Proud and excited for this one! Thank you #ESPNBody for the cover!!\"\n\nElliott and B\u00e1ez also posted pictures of their covers on Instagram, and Waterson and Ennis uploaded behind-the-scenes images from the shoot. \"Remember when Barbie created that cute doll with a little more curves? 5' short little thing packing a bit more in the upper and lower halves? Hi, here I am, an example. Curves and all, one leg,\" Ennis captioned her post. \"I love this body and the hell I've put it through. Thank God, I have been so blessed. I love imperfection, and I love 'imperfect' bodies \u2014 they all tell stories.\"\n\nYou May Also Like: This Body-Positive Clothing Line Will Change How You Think About Wedding Dresses", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-06-27%2520at%252012.54.50%2520PM.png", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-06-27%252520at%25252012.54.50%252520PM.png", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-06-27%2520at%252012.54.50%2520PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park", "Andrea Par"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/espn-body-issue-caroline-wozniacki", "title": "Caroline Wozniacki, Ezekiel Elliott, and More Strip All the Way Down for ESPN The Magazine's Body Issue", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "For the ninth Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine, elite athletes like pro tennis player Caroline Wozniacki and NFL star Ezekiel Elliott posed completely nude.", "id": "59528d150a8bee08711f81a8", "keywords": "sports,snd,espn the body issue,caroline wozniacki", "news_keywords": "sports,snd,espn the body issue,caroline wozniacki", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59528d150a8bee08711f81a8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"For the ninth Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine, elite athletes like pro tennis player Caroline Wozniacki and NFL star Ezekiel Elliott posed completely nude.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "Including Caroline Wozniacki and Ezekiel Elliott.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-06-27%2520at%252012.54.50%2520PM.png", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Your Favorite Athletes Stripped Down for ESPN's Body Issue", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/espn-body-issue-caroline-wozniacki"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Including Caroline Wozniacki and Ezekiel Elliott.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-06-27%2520at%252012.54.50%2520PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Your Favorite Athletes Stripped Down for ESPN's Body Issue"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
