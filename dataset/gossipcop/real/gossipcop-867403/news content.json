In her eyes, the objective analysis of evidence to determine a person\u2019s guilt or innocence is an utterly futile endeavour. \u201cIt is like looking for proof or disproof of the existence of God in a flower,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt all depends on how you read the evidence. If you start out with a presumption of his guilt, you read the documents one way, and another way if you presume his innocence. The material does not \u2018speak for itself\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for reading people: the presumption of guilt will load the person\u2019s words, tone, expressions and actions with strangeness and darkness, the presumption of innocence will vindicate them. Objectivity is impossible.\n\nIt\u2019s also boring.\n\nI am no bystander in the wave of true crime dramas that have crashed into popular culture in recent times: from Sarah Koenig\u2019s Serial podcast, to Andrew Jarecki\u2019s HBO series The Jinx, and now, Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos\u2019s Netflix show Making A Murderer. I have prayed for Adnan Syed\u2019s innocence, I have sworn my certainty of Robert Durst\u2019s burping guilt, I have taped a picture of Dean Strang inside the locker of my heart. I love these shows for their strangeness, for their sheer spectacle, and for the thrill each time new and crazier evidence comes to light, confirming my insightful suspicions.\n\nThe makers of Serial, The Jinx, and Making a Murderer would all declare their purposes were twofold: to make an entertaining programme, and to find the truth. If finding the truth necessitates remaining objective, I\u2019m not sure to what extent these aims are compatible.\n\nReal life crime stories have long been treated as entertainment: from eighteenth-century tabloids to In Cold Blood to The Thin Blue Line. Take, for example, the early twentieth century magazine, True Detective, which splashed sensational stories across its covers like \u201cThe Riddle of Oregon\u2019s Dismembered Brunette\u201d, and spawned giants of the genre like Dashiell Hammett, Jim Thompson, and Ann Rule. Serial, The Jinx and Making a Murderer do show how far the genre has developed since then, but they also share some key similarities. They all concern the violent deaths of beautiful young women, they all suggest that the police were incompetent in securing justice for that woman\u2019s death, and they all invite the audience to retrace the gory details of her killing (perhaps in order to \u201csave\u201d her by ensuring her real killer is punished).\n\nThis is just one of the immediate ways in which true crime can be ethically tricky. Do we want to know every gory detail of these crimes because we care about the victim, or because it excites us? Do we crane our necks at grieving parents for our own entertainment? Is it inherently unethical to treat real lives as spectacle? Aside from general distastefulness, what practical impact does taking evidence out of the courtroom, and into the laps of a potentially limitless audience, have over a case? What are the benefits, and the dangers, of deciding that the law is wrong? These questions are easily asked, and difficult to answer.\n\nIf, as Malcolm argues, our reading of a case is utterly dependent on our own presumptions, what do true crime programmes presume? Overtly or not, the ultimate goal of these programmes is to set out to contradict the current narrative surrounding these cases. On the latest series of Serial, Sarah Koenig says, \u201cI don\u2019t think the state\u2019s story is the correct story.\u201d That\u2019s a provocative, rebellious, exciting statement. The most interesting conclusions is not, \u201cWe can never know for certain, and on balance, we agree with what the state decided at the time.\u201d For better or worse, these programmes do begin with a presumption before they read the evidence, and the presumption is that the dominant narrative is wrong.\n\nAs its title suggests, Making a Murderer is in many ways a story about storytelling: it argues that the state, and contemporary media, fabricated the character of \u201cSteven Avery, the Murderer\u201d because the story was irresistible. It argues that the prosecution, newspapers and television networks manipulated the jury (many potential jurors said at the time they were unfit for court because they were already certain of Avery\u2019s guilt) by offering them a shocking story of kidnap, rape, and murder. Their theory, that Avery was framed by police, is perhaps as shocking in its own way: it\u2019s a tale of systematic deception and incompetence; lies, betrayal, injustice. Like Serial and The Jinx, it has to pose a more interesting alternative to an already interesting story (Serial posits that Hae Min Lee\u2019s real killer still walks free, The Jinx that power, money and shrewdness enabled a violent serial killer to evade capture). Also like Serial and The Jinx, it\u2019s an artistically rendered show, which ensures its subjectivity.\n\nThe makers of these programmes have all been accused of threatening their objectivity by becoming too close with their subjects. A large part of true crime\u2019s appeal is the level of access it brings the viewer: they should be able to offer a more intimate and comprehensive portrait of their subjects than the courts. Koening and Jarecki in particular structure their stories around their own personal interactions with friends, family and, most importantly, their subjects themselves. Koenig said her relationship with Syed is \u201cDefinitely [...] weird and hard to define. It\u2019s a personal relationship. It\u2019s not truly professional.\u201d Jarecki\u2019s ultimate opinion of Durst changes when he (Durst) stops answering his calls. When these personal relationships eat significantly into the narrative, they command unusual power over audience\u2019s final judgements.\n\nSo, too, has each programme been criticised for manipulating the evidence, or leaving out problematic pieces of information that dilute its narrative. Serial failed to include diary extracts that portay Adnan Syed (the man imprisoned for murder) as abusive to his girlfriend, the case\u2019s victim, Hae Min Lee. The Jinx changed up the order of events. Making a Murderer did not disclose that Steven Avery called Teresa Halbach on the day she died, using a feature to disguise his number.\n\nThese programmes have also all been criticised for taking the law into their own hands \u2013 the argument being that they could jeopardise ongoing or potential future investigations. The makers of The Jinx, for example, used a key piece of evidence \u2013 a handwriting sample from the murderer that matched Robert Durst\u2019s (pictured above) \u2013 in their show\u2019s dramatic reveal. As they buried this lead for the sake of suspense, they didn\u2019t give it to authorities, but held onto it for months in order to present it to Durst on camera. Durst was then arrested the evening the finale aired.\n\nThis, of course, has direct repercussions for the police, but more indirect ones too. By moving the power to assess guilt and innocence into the hands of the general public who sit outside of juries, audiences are encouraged to sleuth for their own information. After Serial aired, listeners poured over the private diary entries of a dead woman searching for clues of their own, posting conspiracy theories all over the internet. The same goes for other programmes. Steven Avery\u2019s defence lawyers Jerry Buting and Dean Strang say, \u201cThere are people all over the world who are really picking this case apart now. Maybe someone who saw something or has kept a secret for 10 years will come forward. And judges read online news sources just like everybody else.\u201d While potentially invasive, this is, then, a democratisation of the criminal justice system. But will that mean fewer Steven Averys in future, or more? Right now, it feels like the world is united in Avery\u2019s defence, but Making of a Murderer seeks to demonstrate that Avery\u2019s first false conviction was in part a result of prejudiced members of the public having undue influence over the state. If audiences are so swayed by these show\u2019s subjective narratives, how truly democratic can this be?\n\nOne of the main themes Making a Murderer revisits again and again is the vulnerability of the Avery family. In Avery\u2019s own words, \u201cPoor people lose... poor people lose all the time.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t dress like everybody else, they didn\u2019t have education like everybody else... the Avery family didn\u2019t fit in to the community,\u201d explains one of Avery\u2019s first lawyers. \u201cPenny Beerntsen [the victim from Avery\u2019s first conviction] was everything Stephen wasn\u2019t.\u201d Strang describes Steven Avery\u2019s nephew Brendan \u2013 a key witness in his second conviction \u2013 as \u201ca learning-disabled 16-year-old who\u2019s not equipped to face the trouble in which he finds himself.\u201d Here, then, are individuals who are easily taken advantage of, especially by authority figures with power, resources, and an agenda.\n\nThe journalist, too, is a figure of authority with power, resources, and an agenda. Why wouldn\u2019t someone who feels that they have been wronged or humiliated want to believe that the journalist is the answer to their prayers, the person who could set the world to rights? In that case, what does it mean to take the lives of ordinary, vulnerable people, and turn them into entertainment for a potentially limitless audience? Could it rescue them, and others like them? Could it be another way for them to have their lives \u201ctaken away\u201d?\n\nThroughout the series, Brendan\u2019s particular narrative is one of a young man who is not allowed to tell his own story for himself. He gives an initial statement saying he saw Steven for parts of that day, and nothing of note occurred. Investigators are suspicious, and bring him in for more questioning. \u201cWe know there\u2019s some things you left out, and we know there\u2019s some things that weren\u2019t quite correct,\u201d they insist. \u201cWe really need you to be honest this time.\u201d An interview with a confessions expert is shown, who says \u201cWhen they say to Brendan, \u2018Be honest,\u2019 what they sort of mean is... \u2018Don\u2019t tell us that, tell us something else.\u2019\u201d Brendan assents to leading questions from officers (Wiegert and Fassbender). When he is asked to give details himself, his suggestions are delivered like a student grasping for the plot details of a book they haven\u2019t read, to an exasperated literature teacher.\n\nWiegert: Come on. Something with the head. Brendan? What else did you guys do? Come on.\n\nFassbender: What he made you do, Brendan. We know he made you do something else.\n\nWiegert: What was it? What was it?\n\nFassbender: We have the evidence, Brendan. We just need you to... to be honest with us.\n\nBrendan: ... That he cut off her hair.\n\nWiegert: He cut off her hair? OK. What else?\n\nFassbender: What else was done to her head?\n\nBrendan: ... That he punched her.\n\nWiegert: What else?\n\nFassbender: It\u2019s extremely, extremely important you tell us this for us to believe you.\n\nWiegert: Come on, Brendan. What else?\n\nFassbender: We know. We just need you to tell us.\n\nBrendan: That\u2019s all I can remember.\n\nWiegert: All right, I\u2019m just gonna come out and ask you. Who shot her in the head?\n\nBrendan: He did.\n\nWiegert: Why didn\u2019t you tell us that?\n\nBrendan: \u2019Cause I couldn\u2019t think of it.\n\nHe later tells his mother on the phone that he was \u201cguessing\u201d, explaining, \u201cthat\u2019s what I do with my homework, too\u201d. When Brendan tries to give a third statement contradicting this one (and confirming his first: that nothing of note happened), he is told \u201cI want you to testify against Steven Avery and tell the truth. And this is how I can help you. But I can\u2019t help you with those words that you wrote down. Those words, I can\u2019t help you at all.\u201d Brendan is not given ownership over his own narrative.\n\nArguably, by pointing this out, the producers of Making a Murderer are rescuing Brendan, offering him an alternative. Brendan looks better in their story, the one where he\u2019s an impressionable young man who didn\u2019t commit any violent crimes, rather than an impressionable young man who did. But it\u2019s naive to assume that because it\u2019s more positive, it\u2019s any more his. Brendan is ill-equipped to defend himself to police, so does it follow that he is more equipped to handle the level of scrutiny that comes with being on an internationally-followed documentary series? We might hear Brendan\u2019s voice and see his words on paper, but, arguably, he has even less power to assert himself here than he does in police custody.\n\nThe programme rightly asserts that it\u2019s unethical to treat vulnerable young people like pliable evidence, moulding their stories to support your case. How far, in any sense, can Making a Murderer be considered guilty of doing the same?\n\nMaking a Murderer, The Jinx, Serial and the rest all play with using dramatic conventions to vitalise journalistic storytelling. That means that, to a degree, they turn their subjects into characters. Malcolm writes that perhaps the key difference between fictional characters and tangible, breathing humans is that the former \u201care drawn with much broader and blunter strokes, are much simpler, more generic (or, as they used to say, mythic) creatures than real people, and their preternatural vividness derives from their unambiguous fixity and consistency\u201d. Real people, then, due to their nuance, their complexity, their ambiguity, and their capacity for change, make, for the most part, fairly dull comparisons. That means that when looking for their protagonist, true crime writers search for \u201cpeople of a certain rare, exhibitionistic, self-fabulising nature, who have already done the work on themselves that the novelist does on his imaginary characters \u2013 who, in short, present themselves as ready-made literary figures.\u201d\n\nThis is how we get Adnan the falsely imprisoned model minority, Robert Durst the bitter little rich boy with delusions of grandeur, and Steven Avery the everyman trampled by the system: twice.\n\nWhen people become characters, objectivity is sidelined, and subjectivity rules. This is what allowed audience members to pronounce themselves not #TeamEdward or #TeamJacob, but #TeamAdnan on social media, or to see Avery\u2019s defence team as more morally unblemished than Atticus Finch. It\u2019s what caused someone convincingly purporting to be Hae Min Lee\u2019s brother on Reddit to insist \u201cTO ME ITS REAL LIFE. To you listeners, its [sic] another murder mystery, crime drama, another episode of CSI. You weren\u2019t there to see your mom crying every night [...] I pray that you don\u2019t have to go through what we went through and have your story blasted to 5mil listeners.\u201d It\u2019s what caused an outcry at the end of Serial\u2019s first season when it failed to offer a crime drama-style closing revelation: even journalists like Mike Pesca on the Slate metapodcast, were frustrated. \u201cDon\u2019t let this,\u201d he said, \u201cwind up being a contemplation on the nature of truth.\u201d And it\u2019s what convinces people so utterly that their own take on each story is the right one.\n\nIn Making a Murderer, Dean Strang states, \u201cMost of what ails our criminal justice system lies in unwarranted certitude on the part of police officers and prosecutors and defence lawyers and judges and jurors that they are getting it right. That they are simply right. Just a tragic lack of humility in everyone who participates in our criminal justice system.\u201d Arguably, these programmes are extending the problem to those who don\u2019t participate at all.\n\nI wish I could handle these questions with Janet Malcolm\u2019s fire and certainty, and insist that \u201cevery journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible\u201d, that these programmes have only \u201cdeepened my consciousness of the canker that lies at the heart of the rose of journalism\u201d. Despite myself, I\u2019m glad that The Jinx was made, not just because I devoured it, but because I think Robert Durst probably did it, and I\u2019m glad he was arrested. If he is found guilty, shouldn\u2019t we be grateful? I\u2019m glad that Making a Murderer was made too, because I think law enforcement needs to be more intensely scrutinised, and whether the framing narrative proves to be true or not, the programme reveals the officers at its core to be, at the very least, worryingly incompetent.\n\nI still believe that true crime can be sceptical, revealing, and challenging in way that is productive, not just titillating. But as with any artistic genre, it is doomed to remain subjective and impressionistic, and can be inaccurate and misleading. Audiences therefore have a responsibility to treat every new story as an artefact to be examined, analysed, and interrogated from a number of angles. It cannot be allowed to speak for itself.\n\nNow listen to Anna discussing this on the NS pop culture podcast:", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6025943409225&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=GBP&noscript=1", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/most_popular_homesectiontrending_264_198/public/blogs_2020/04/gettyimages-83160983.jpg?itok=Nsc45Qv7&c=042fb6f82f9337cd00f2cb6c0e706fa7", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/all/themes/creative-responsive-theme/images/nsnetworks.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6032031760848&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=GBP&noscript=1", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/most_popular_homesectiontrending_264_198/public/blogs_2020/04/gettyimages-803999638.jpg?itok=v5LJPLvC&c=203d454905210c0479e97bbd562370d1", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/magazine-cover-thumb/public/magazinecovers/2020_14_spring_special_med.jpg?itok=rbo6JJvO", "http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/robert_durst_handwriting.jpg?itok=93ASBYxz", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/homesection_image/public/blogs_2016/01/mam.jpg?itok=4z7Xjwcf", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/ns_book_offer_feb_18.jpg", "http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/avery.jpg?itok=mlO0VYPb", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/anna_leszkiewicz_resized.jpg", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/all/modules/paywall/assets/img/private-modal.png", "https://newstatesman.com/sites/all/themes/creative-responsive-theme/images/newstatesman_logo@2x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/975790991/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2016/01/mam.jpg?itok=-PFS_8VP", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=ntow3&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/ns-ga.jpeg?itok=soqxWQNh", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/blogs_2020/04/mc.jpg?itok=GDyAtbb3", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/all/themes/creative-responsive-theme/images/newstatesman_logo@2x.png", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/most_popular_homesectiontrending_264_198/public/blogs_2020/04/gettyimages-1209936647.jpg?itok=K4PAExSq", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/blogs_2020/04/gettyimages-1145713456.jpg?itok=vcaHGIg5", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/most_popular_homesectiontrending_264_198/public/Longreads_2020/04/gettyimages-1208384077.jpg?itok=ptYDAnHW&c=d6cac1e4cba3d73bffadcc7221a19ee7", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/blogs_2020/04/quiz.jpg?itok=LWDf1xZC", "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/trending_264_198/public/blogs_2020/03/shutterstock_heart_monitor_liverpool.jpg?itok=7Z50AShk&c=0b31f36b14f1af1115d3279da7204d07", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=ntow3&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=newstatesmanc-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1847085342", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=526380280843209&ev=PixelInitialized", "http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/true_detective_1.jpg?itok=Wk8YVuxH"], "top_img": "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/homesection_image/public/blogs_2016/01/mam.jpg?itok=4z7Xjwcf", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thomas Bird", "Jim Weatherall", "Helen Duckworth", "Simon Maskell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2016/01/serial-making-murderer-can-true-crime-entertainment-ever-be-ethical", "title": "From Serial to Making a Murderer: can true crime as entertainment ever be ethical?", "meta_data": {"og": {"image": "https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/homesection_image/public/blogs_2016/01/mam.jpg?itok=4z7Xjwcf", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2016/01/serial-making-murderer-can-true-crime-entertainment-ever-be-ethical", "title": "From Serial to Making a Murderer: can true crime as entertainment ever be ethical?", "description": "In her book The Journalist and the Murderer, Janet Malcolm wrote something that shocked and angered people.

Maybe someone who saw something or has kept a secret for 10 years will come forward. And judges read online news sources just like everybody else.\u201d While potentially invasive, this is, then, a democratisation of the criminal justice system. But will that mean fewer Steven Averys in future, or more? Right now, it feels like the world is united in Avery\u2019s defence, but Making of a Murderer seeks to demonstrate that Avery\u2019s first false conviction was in part a result of prejudiced members of the public having undue influence over the state. If audiences are so swayed by these show\u2019s subjective narratives, how truly democratic can this be?  One of the main themes Making a Murderer revisits again and again is the vulnerability of the Avery family. In Avery\u2019s own words, \u201cPoor people lose... poor people lose all the time.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t dress like everybody else, they didn\u2019t have education like everybody else... the Avery family didn\u2019t fit in to the community,\u201d explains one of Avery\u2019s first lawyers. \u201cPenny Beerntsen [the victim from Avery\u2019s first conviction] was everything Stephen wasn\u2019t.\u201d Strang describes Steven Avery\u2019s nephew Brendan \u2013 a key witness in his second conviction \u2013 as \u201ca learning-disabled 16-year-old who\u2019s not equipped to face the trouble in which he finds himself.\u201d Here, then, are individuals who are easily taken advantage of, especially by authority figures with power, resources, and an agenda. The journalist, too, is a figure of authority with power, resources, and an agenda. Why wouldn\u2019t someone who feels that they have been wronged or humiliated want to believe that the journalist is the answer to their prayers, the person who could set the world to rights? In that case, what does it mean to take the lives of ordinary, vulnerable people, and turn them into entertainment for a potentially limitless audience? Could it rescue them, and others like them? Could it be another way for them to have their lives \u201ctaken away\u201d? Throughout the series, Brendan\u2019s particular narrative is one of a young man who is not allowed to tell his own story for himself. He gives an initial statement saying he saw Steven for parts of that day, and nothing of note occurred. Investigators are suspicious, and bring him in for more questioning. \u201cWe know there\u2019s some things you left out, and we know there\u2019s some things that weren\u2019t quite correct,\u201d they insist. \u201cWe really need you to be honest this time.\u201d An interview with a confessions expert is shown, who says \u201cWhen they say to Brendan, \u2018Be honest,\u2019 what they sort of mean is... \u2018Don\u2019t tell us that, tell us something else.\u2019\u201d Brendan assents to leading questions from officers (Wiegert and Fassbender). When he is asked to give details himself, his suggestions are delivered like a student grasping for the plot details of a book they haven\u2019t read, to an exasperated literature teacher. Wiegert: Come on. Something with the head. Brendan? What else did you guys do? Come on. Fassbender: What he made you do, Brendan. We know he made you do something else. Wiegert: What was it? What was it? Fassbender: We have the evidence, Brendan. We just need you to... to be honest with us. Brendan: ... That he cut off her hair. Wiegert: He cut off her hair? OK. What else? Fassbender: What else was done to her head? Brendan: ... That he punched her. Wiegert: What else? Fassbender: It\u2019s extremely, extremely important you tell us this for us to believe you. Wiegert: Come on, Brendan. What else? Fassbender: We know. We just need you to tell us. Brendan: That\u2019s all I can remember. Wiegert: All right, I\u2019m just gonna come out and ask you. Who shot her in the head? Brendan: He did. Wiegert: Why didn\u2019t you tell us that? Brendan: \u2019Cause I couldn\u2019t think of it. He later tells his mother on the phone that he was \u201cguessing\u201d, explaining, \u201cthat\u2019s what I do with my homework, too\u201d. When Brendan tries to give a third statement contradicting this one (and confirming his first: that nothing of note happened), he is told \u201cI want you to testify against Steven Avery and tell the truth. And this is how I can help you. But I can\u2019t help you with those words that you wrote down. Those words, I can\u2019t help you at all.\u201d Brendan is not given ownership over his own narrative. Arguably, by pointing this out, the producers of Making a Murderer are rescuing Brendan, offering him an alternative. Brendan looks better in their story, the one where he\u2019s an impressionable young man who didn\u2019t commit any violent crimes, rather than an impressionable young man who did. But it\u2019s naive to assume that because it\u2019s more positive, it\u2019s any more his. Brendan is ill-equipped to defend himself to police, so does it follow that he is more equipped to handle the level of scrutiny that comes with being on an internationally-followed documentary series? We might hear Brendan\u2019s voice and see his words on paper, but, arguably, he has even less power to assert himself here than he does in police custody. The programme rightly asserts that it\u2019s unethical to treat vulnerable young people like pliable evidence, moulding their stories to support your case. How far, in any sense, can Making a Murderer be considered guilty of doing the same? Making a Murderer, The Jinx, Serial and the rest all play with using dramatic conventions to vitalise journalistic storytelling. That means that, to a degree, they turn their subjects into characters. Malcolm writes that perhaps the key difference between fictional characters and tangible, breathing humans is that the former \u201care drawn with much broader and blunter strokes, are much simpler, more generic (or, as they used to say, mythic) creatures than real people, and their preternatural vividness derives from their unambiguous fixity and consistency\u201d. Real people, then, due to their nuance, their complexity, their ambiguity, and their capacity for change, make, for the most part, fairly dull comparisons. That means that when looking for their protagonist, true crime writers search for \u201cpeople of a certain rare, exhibitionistic, self-fabulising nature, who have already done the work on themselves that the novelist does on his imaginary characters \u2013 who, in short, present themselves as ready-made literary figures.\u201d This is how we get Adnan the falsely imprisoned model minority, Robert Durst the bitter little rich boy with delusions of grandeur, and Steven Avery the everyman trampled by the system: twice. When people become characters, objectivity is sidelined, and subjectivity rules. This is what allowed audience members to pronounce themselves not #TeamEdward or #TeamJacob, but #TeamAdnan on social media, or to see Avery\u2019s defence team as more morally unblemished than Atticus Finch. It\u2019s what caused someone convincingly purporting to be Hae Min Lee\u2019s brother on Reddit to insist \u201cTO ME ITS REAL LIFE. To you listeners, its [sic] another murder mystery, crime drama, another episode of CSI. You weren\u2019t there to see your mom crying every night [...] I pray that you don\u2019t have to go through what we went through and have your story blasted to 5mil listeners.\u201d It\u2019s what caused an outcry at the end of Serial\u2019s first season when it failed to offer a crime drama-style closing revelation: even journalists like Mike Pesca on the Slate metapodcast, were frustrated. \u201cDon\u2019t let this,\u201d he said, \u201cwind up being a contemplation on the nature of truth.\u201d And it\u2019s what convinces people so utterly that their own take on each story is the right one. In Making a Murderer, Dean Strang states, \u201cMost of what ails our criminal justice system lies in unwarranted certitude on the part of police officers and prosecutors and defence lawyers and judges and jurors that they are getting it right. That they are simply right. Just a tragic lack of humility in everyone who participates in our criminal justice system.\u201d Arguably, these programmes are extending the problem to those who don\u2019t participate at all. I wish I could handle these questions with Janet Malcolm\u2019s fire and certainty, and insist that \u201cevery journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible\u201d, that these programmes have only \u201cdeepened my consciousness of the canker that lies at the heart of the rose of journalism\u201d. Despite myself, I\u2019m glad that The Jinx was made, not just because I devoured it, but because I think Robert Durst probably did it, and I\u2019m glad he was arrested. If he is found guilty, shouldn\u2019t we be grateful? I\u2019m glad that Making a Murderer was made too, because I think law enforcement needs to be more intensely scrutinised, and whether the framing narrative proves to be true or not, the programme reveals the officers at its core to be, at the very least, worryingly incompetent. I still believe that true crime can be sceptical, revealing, and challenging in way that is productive, not just titillating. But as with any artistic genre, it is doomed to remain subjective and impressionistic, and can be inaccurate and misleading. Audiences therefore have a responsibility to treat every new story as an artefact to be examined, analysed, and interrogated from a number of angles. It cannot be allowed to speak for itself.
