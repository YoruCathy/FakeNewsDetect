January Jones is not holding back when it comes to talking about being a single mother \u2014 and the damper it can put on intimacy.\n\n\u201cIt limits your sex life, for sure,\u201d the 40-year-old Mad Men alum said during an interview with Violet Gray published on Friday, January 26.\n\nShe explained: \u201cBecause you can\u2019t bring someone home when your kid\u2019s coming into the room. Honestly, my son turns up in the middle of the night and asks for a massage, and then I fall asleep. I imagine that\u2019s what marriage is like?\u201d\n\nBut the blonde beauty \u2014 who has recently been linked to The Bachelor\u2019s Nick Viall \u2014 revealed how important she thinks lovemaking is.\n\n\u201cSex, what\u2019s that? As my mom always said, sex is a gauge of your relationship, so if you have a good relationship you should be having sex regularly,\u201d Jones told the outlet. \u201cEven if you\u2019re angry or you\u2019ve been together for a million and five years. You have to force yourself to have that physical connection.\u201d\n\nAs for what makes for good sex? \u201c[Being] comfortable with your body,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Last Man on Earth actress continued to detail how she believes you become happy in your own skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know about men, but for women I think that comes with age\u2014knowing and loving yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wouldn\u2019t ask for things I knew I wanted because I was insecure. And everybody\u2019s different, so guys don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to work. But hopefully now I\u2019m more comfortable with my body and my sexuality.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps she\u2019ll find her final rose with Viall. Though nothing has been confirmed, the duo, amid reports that they were dating, have showed subtle displays of affection on social media since earlier this month, Us Weekly previously reported.\n\nPrior to fans pointing out their flirty interactions, Jones admitted in a November interview on The Late Late Show with James Corden that Viall had randomly reached out to her.\n\n\u201cHe asked me to battle him on Lip Sync Battle,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cSo is that, like, his way of asking me out, or does he have a problem with me? I don\u2019t know what that was. But I declined, because I don\u2019t need to be humiliated.\u201d\n\nShe added, jokingly: \u201cYou don\u2019t know if you like him or if he\u2019s a scumbag \u2014 and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m attracted to him, maybe?\u201d\n\nJones was previously linked to director Noah Miller, Jason Sudeikis, Ashton Kutcher and Josh Groban.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/853921280_january-jones-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/853921280_january-jones-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/853921280_january-jones-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/january-jones-being-a-single-mom-limits-your-sex-life/", "title": "January Jones: Being a Single Mom 'Limits Your Sex Life'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "January Jones opened up about the damper being a single mother can put on your sex life during a recent interview \u2014 see what she said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "January Jones Talks Being a Single Mom: 'It Limits Your Sex Life'", "description": "January Jones opened up about the damper being a single mother can put on your sex life during a recent interview \u2014 see what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/january-jones-being-a-single-mom-limits-your-sex-life/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:00:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/853921280_january-jones-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/853921280_january-jones-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-01-26T23:28:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:00:13+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "January Jones opened up about the damper being a single mother can put on your sex life during a recent interview \u2014 see what she said", "title": "January Jones Talks Being a Single Mom: 'It Limits Your Sex Life'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/853921280_january-jones-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517009293.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
