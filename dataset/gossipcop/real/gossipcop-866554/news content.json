News on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I had to call her like \u2018Yo! You\u2019re married?\u2019 Because I was thinking maybe it was fake. And then she\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m really married.'\u201d\n\nMoore, 36, quietly wed Marc Daly in an intimate ceremony in St. Lucia last month, teasing the nuptials through her social media platforms. And while Daly\u2019s identity has since been confirmed, Burruss, 41, revealed she has yet to meet Moore\u2019s Mr. Right.\n\n\u201cI have not met him personally but she has talked to me about him since last year, towards the end of the year. So I knew she had met someone that she had really liked,\u201d Burruss said.\n\nWith production underway for Atlanta\u2019s tenth season, Moore\u2019s status on the show remains unclear as she and husband Daly are reportedly against filming their private lives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what he wants, but I\u2019m confident that she\u2019s afraid to jeopardize her relationship with what comes with the show, which I understand,\u201d Burruss explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of tension. And for somebody that\u2019s never been on TV, it\u2019s a lot of pressure and it would have to be something for him to get used to. And not everyone is able to get used to it.\u201d\n\nBurruss has been a part of the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchise since 2009, which also included the 2014 spinoff, \u201cKandi\u2019s Wedding,\u201d documenting her union with Todd Tucker.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rhoa.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rhoa.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rhoa.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/07/13/kandi-burruss-thought-kenya-moores-wedding-was-fake/", "title": "Kandi Burruss thought Kenya Moore\u2019s wedding was fake", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
