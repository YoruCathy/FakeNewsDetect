The former Voice contestant was recognized at the Humane Society\u2019s annual To The Rescue! benefit in Los Angeles over the weekend.\n\nHer family was moved to tears when they accepted the Impact Award on her behalf during the ceremony.\n\nRachel Platten performed \u201cFight Song\u201d as a tribute to the 22-year-old while an emotional video montage played in the background.\n\nHer mother and father, Tina and Bud Grimmie, and her brother, Marcus Grimmie, all went on stage to speak on Christina\u2019s behalf and talk about her love of animals.\n\n\"Christina loved the Humane Society, she loved the rescue, she loved animals,\" Tina told E! News.\n\nThe singer\u2019s close friend Sarah Luebkemann also attended the event and posted an emotional message to Instagram afterwards. \"Got all dolled up for the @humanesociety gala tonight where they were not only honoring Christina for the simply incredible human she is, but celebrating her for the passion and heart that she poured into supporting their cause,\" she wrote.\n\nA post shared by S a r a h R y l y n n (@happlesful) on Apr 22, 2017 at 9:33pm PDT\n\n\"It was simply beautiful. Lots of tears and hugs. I've so enjoyed getting to know the people and causes Christina was pouring her heart into the last several years. And finally got to meet the very sweet @rachelplatten,\u201d she continued. \"Christina toured with her last year and she absolutely loved Rachel. Rachel, thank you for being so kind and genuine, and for loving on & encouraging Christina.\u201d\n\nThe YouTube star was shot to death in Orlando, Florida following her concert last June. She passed away in a hospital just a few hours later. What an emotional night. We know Christina will never be forgotten!", "images": ["http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/26152787_1896505867329996_8668809372878503936_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/christina-grimmie-death-750x522.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery-pregnant-320x223-1511803275.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21149338_757212517791923_6938295666963644416_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-519451536-320x223-1495779173.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/wetpaint.svg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/christina-grimmie-death-640x480.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/loading.gif", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nick-carter-sexual-assault-320x223-1509372738.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21041889_254812198371809_8175695720834138112_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/christina-grimmie-death.jpg"], "top_img": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/christina-grimmie-death.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "http://wetpaint.com/christina-grimmie-humane-society-gala-award-1585464/", "title": "Christina Grimmie\u2019s Family Accept Award on Her Behalf at Humane Society Gala", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Nearly a year after Christina Grimmie\u2019s devastating death, her family is honoring her at 2017\u2019s Humane Society Gala.", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Christina Grimmie Humane Society Gala 2017 Family Accepts Award", "description": "Nearly a year after Christina Grimmie\u2019s devastating death, her family is honoring her at 2017\u2019s Humane Society Gala.", "url": "http://wetpaint.com/christina-grimmie-humane-society-gala-award-1585464/", "site_name": "Wetpaint", "image": {"identifier": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/christina-grimmie-death.jpg", "width": 1080, "height": 800}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Wetpaint", "tag": "News", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2017-04-24T12:11:04-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Nearly a year after Christina Grimmie\u2019s devastating death, her family is honoring her at 2017\u2019s Humane Society Gala.", "title": "Christina Grimmie Humane Society Gala 2017 Family Accepts Award", "site": "@wetpainttv", "image": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/christina-grimmie-death.jpg", "creator": "@wetpainttv"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1688777764767389}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493050264.0, "source": "http://www.wetpaint.com", "summary": ""}
