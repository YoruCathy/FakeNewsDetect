We just have the best time together.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s a typical date night like for the couple?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a lot of date nights, because I\u2019m always with [my daughter] Kirra, and Ryan is touring a lot,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut we just do a lot of group things and hang out.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Audrina Patridge and Ryan Cabrera Cabo Pictures\n\nPatridge, 33, and Cabrera, 35,reconciled eight months after she filed for divorce from estranged husband Corey Bohan, 36, whom she married in Hawaii in November 2016.
