Cross apparently logged off of Twitter shortly after the Times interview went live, and had not yet seen the apologies issued by his co-stars Jason Bateman and Tony Hale who, along with Will Arnett, essentially gaslighted Walter by minimizing the effect Tambor\u2019s behavior had on her during the conflict, even as she emphasized that she had never been treated so poorly by someone in her 60-year career.\n\nFor coming to Tambor\u2019s defense (he told the Times that the actor has \u201clearned from the experience and he\u2019s listening and learning and growing,\u201d adding \u201cThat\u2019s important to remember\u201d) instead of empathizing with the actively weeping Walter, Cross told Gothamist, \u201cI will unequivocally apologize to Jessica. I\u2019m sorry that we behaved the way we behaved. Whatever the criticisms are, I will own up. I don\u2019t even know what they are, as I said, I saw the initial thing but I jumped off [of Twitter] at the behest of various people.\u201d He also said that, \u201cI think we kind of got what we deserved,\u201d because they never addressed Tambor\u2019s blow-up as a group prior to this press tour.\n\nCross said too that he has been having conversations about the backlash with his wife, Amber Tamblyn, as well as his co-star, Alia Shawkat, who was the only Arrested cast member to call Tambor\u2019s behavior toward Walter unacceptable without qualification in the Times conversation. \u201cI agreed with Alia that there was no excuse. There\u2019s never an excuse ever for yelling at somebody and humiliating them in front of other people,\u201d said Cross, who explained that he once saw Walter treat another performer on set poorly, but that her outburst did not approach the severity of Tambor\u2019s. \u201cThere was no excuse when Jessica did it. To Jessica\u2019s credit, she eventually apologized to the actress, and felt bad about it. Jeffrey did as well, but it was a bigger deal, there were more people in the room and it was an extremely uncomfortable moment.\u201d\n\nIn the Times conversation, Bateman pressed the point that the unique demands of acting can result in strange behavior when an actor is working through their \u201cprocess,\u201d but Cross stressed multiple times to Gothamist that Tambor\u2019s treatment of Walter was \u201cegregious and there was a little bit of cruelty to it, which I have a real issue with,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to defend what Jeffrey did at all, because I would never do that. I\u2019ve never seen anybody do that to that level and that\u2019s just not right. There\u2019s just no excuse for behaving like that.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/24/24-david-cross.w330.h330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8fd/b49/a957de191f17e7791e5db0c02a1f517118-24-david-cross.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8fd/b49/a957de191f17e7791e5db0c02a1f517118-24-david-cross.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/david-cross-unequivocally-apologizes-to-jessica-walter.html", "title": "David Cross \u2018Unequivocally\u2019 Apologizes to Jessica Walter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "David Cross Says He Will \u2018Unequivocally Apologize\u2019 to Jessica Walter", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/david-cross-unequivocally-apologizes-to-jessica-walter.html", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we behaved the way we behaved.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8fd/b49/a957de191f17e7791e5db0c02a1f517118-24-david-cross.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "David Cross \u2018Unequivocally\u2019 Apologizes to Jessica Walter", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we behaved the way we behaved.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8fd/b49/a957de191f17e7791e5db0c02a1f517118-24-david-cross.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jorcru", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-24T19:41:25.033-04:00", "tag": "arrested development, david cross, jason bateman, jeffrey tambor, jessica walter, alia shawkat, tony hale, tv, backlash", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "David Cross addressed the controversial interview the cast of \u2018Arrested Development\u2019 gave to the New York \u2018Times\u2019, in which Jessica Walter\u2019s male co-stars minimized the severity of Jeffrey Tambor berating her on set, even as she sat there and cried.", "sailthru.tags": "arrested development, david cross, jason bateman, jeffrey tambor, jessica walter, alia shawkat, tony hale, tv, backlash", "author": "Jordan Crucchiola", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527205285.033, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
