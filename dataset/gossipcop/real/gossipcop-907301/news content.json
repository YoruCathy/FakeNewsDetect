Jordan said to the Wall Street Journal recently that he was \u201cdating,\u201d but it\u2019s challenging to find someone in the city in which he lives.\n\nThe star of Black Panthers blamed his lack of a love life on the city, Los Angeles, the city of Angels. Michael said LA isn\u2019t exactly conducive to a romantic relationship.\n\nHowever, with that said, even if he wanted to have a girlfriend he would probably have to get the approval of his roommates. Ironically, the movie star lives with his mom and dad.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Michael\u2019s roommates are his mom and dad. They moved out to Los Angeles to be with him after his career took off.\n\nAnd while some might be disappointed Michael hasn\u2019t found luck, it\u2019s not likely he would be able to make it work anyway; he\u2019s always busy preparing for roles.\n\nTo get ready for his character as Erik Killmonger, he studied other actors\u2019 performances such as Heath Ledger and Michael Fassbender. Jordan said he intends to create \u201ca performance that people will remember,\u201d something which is different.\n\nHe even put on twenty pounds of muscle for the movie. He gained it everywhere, in the chest, on his back, his legs, his quads; according to the star, he was massive.\n\nAdditionally, Michael intends to make an appearance in HBO\u2019s adaption of Fahrenheit 451, the series which is based on the classic dystopian novel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd surprisingly \u2013 even though he\u2019s super famous as an actor \u2013 people still ask him if he\u2019s related to Michael Jordan, the legendary basketball player. He said people say to him, \u201cis he your dad?\u201d The only response he can muster is merely to shake his head.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Michael-B-Jordan-Slate.com_-e1516330310802.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Michael-B.-Jordan-TorontoSun.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toya-Johnson-282x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/zendaya-michael-b-jordan-same-gray-suit-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiny-Harris-reveals-the-new-addition-to-the-family-with-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/TorontoSun.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tamar-Braxton-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blac-chyna-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Michael-B-Jordan-Slate.com_-e1516330310802.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/michael-b-jordan-says-la-isnt-the-best-place-to-date-and-hes-technically-single-106536/", "title": "Michael B Jordan Says \u201cLA Isn\u2019t The Best Place To Date\u201d And He\u2019s \u201cTechnically\u201d Single", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "michael b. jordan,", "keywords": "celebrity news, michael b. jordan,", "description": "Michael B Jordan is currently lacking a romantic partner.
