She rose to prominence with her role as Addie Singer in the Nickelodeon television series Unfabulous. She subsequently released her debut album, which also served as the show's soundtrack, Unfabulous and More. After Unfabulous ended, Roberts shifted focus to roles in films, first starring in the film Aquamarine and later as the title character in the 2007 film Nancy Drew. Looking for more mature roles, Roberts appeared in the 2009 drama Lymelife and went on to several more films, often in leading roles. She was part of the acting ensemble with her aunt Julia Roberts in the 2010 film Valentine's Day. In her 2013 return to television, she took on the role of Madison Montgomery in American Horror Story: Coven, the third season of the American Horror Story series.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts was born in Rhinebeck, New York.She is the daughter of actor Eric Roberts and Kelly Cunningham, the stepdaughter of Eliza Roberts and Kelly Nickels, and the niece of actresses Julia Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan. She also has a half sister, Grace. During her childhood, Roberts spent time on the sets of her aunt Julia Roberts' films. These experiences sparked a desire in Emma, from the age of five, to follow her father and aunts into the film industry. Her mother initially wanted her to have a normal childhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Roberts Upcoming Movie, TV show\n\n\n\n\n\nActing career\n\n2001\u201305: Early career\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts made her acting debut at age nine in Ted Demme's 2001 drama Blow. It was the first film for which she ever auditioned. In the film, she portrayed Kristina Jung, the daughter of Johnny Depp's character (cocaine smuggler George Jung). That year, she also had a role in Leif Tilden's 10-minute short bigLove, and was an uncredited extra in some scenes featuring her aunt Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe went on to appear in smaller roles in two family films: in 2002's Grand Champion, as the sister of the main character Buddy (Jacob Fisher); and in 2003's Spymate, as the kidnapped daughter of former secret agent Mike Muggins (Chris Potter), who tries to rescue her with the help of a spy monkey. Grand Champion had a brief theatrical release in August 2004, while Spymate was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in Canada, followed by its DVD release in April 2006. In August 2003, Roberts was scheduled to shoot an independent film called Daisy Winters, starring as the title character, alongside Rachel Weisz. However, the film, which would have been Roberts's first leading role, never began shooting due to financial problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\u201312: Theatrical films\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Roberts returned to the big screen, starring alongside Sara Paxton and singer JoJo in Aquamarine. She won a 2007 Young Artist Award for Best Supporting Young Actress in a Feature Film for her role in the film.The film Aquamarine took 5th place at the box office on its opening weekend making $8 million. In early 2006, Roberts finished shooting her title role in Nancy Drew. The film was released to theaters on June 15, 2007, and grossed over $7 million in its opening weekend,though the film was not well received by critics. Roberts was set to reunite with Nancy Drew director Andrew Fleming on both Rodeo Gal and a Nancy Drew sequel in 2007, but these films were never made. In 2008, she had her voiceover debut when she voiced the English version of the character Wilma in the CGI-animated family film The Flight Before Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Roberts starred alongside Jake T. Austin in Hotel for Dogs, based on the novel by Lois Duncan. The film premiered in January 2009, and took fifth place in its opening weekend with over $17 million. The film has to-date grossed over $114 million, and received generally mixed reviews from critics.Roberts starred as the lead in the film Wild Child, about a rebellious teen from Malibu, California sent to a boarding school in England. Roberts described her character as \"pretty much your typical spoiled-brat Malibu socialite who gets shipped off to British boarding school.\"Roberts also appeared in the indie film Lymelife with Alec Baldwin, which was premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. Roberts said that Lymelife is \u201ckind of like American Beauty meets The Ice Storm\u201d, and that her reasoning for doing the film was that, \"Some people look at me and think, She's just Julia Roberts's niece. So I wanted to do something smaller and edgier, something that would show I really am an actress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic career\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Roberts had a debut album titled Unfabulous and More. The album was released on September 27, 2005, through Columbia Records and Nick Records. It also served as the soundtrack to the television series, Unfabulous, in which Roberts stars. The album peaked at No. 46 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. In September 2005, two promotional singles were released from the album\u2014\"I Wanna Be\" and \"Dummy.\" The album includes several original songs (among them \"Dummy\" and \"I Wanna Be,\" both of which were also released as music videos, \"I Have Arrived\" and \"This Is Me,\" which was co-written by Roberts), as well as some of Addie's songs from the first season, including \"Punch Rocker\" and \"New Shoes\" (both from the episode \"The Party\"), \"94 Weeks (Metal Mouth Freak)\" (from \"The Bar Mitzvah\") and \"Mexican Wrestler\" (which had previously appeared on Jill Sobule's 2000 album Pink Pearl and in the episode \"The 66th Day\" from Unfabulous). During the same year, Roberts recorded \"If I Had It My Way\" for the soundtrack of the 2005 Disney film Ice Princess. In 2006, Roberts covered the song \"Island in the Sun\", which was originally recorded by Weezer in 2001; she recorded the song for the Aquamarine's soundtrack, a film where she starred as one of the leads.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesmodel\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2009, she was named the brand ambassador for Neutrogena, appearing in print and television ads for the company.Roberts has also appeared multiple times as part of Teen Vogue\u2019s Best Dressed list, including June 2007, September 2008, December 2008 and February 2009.\n\nPersonal life\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2011, Roberts began attending Sarah Lawrence College but by January 2012, Roberts left school to concentrate on work commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Roberts News, Gossip, Relationship history\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts began dating actor Evan Peters in mid-2012. Roberts was arrested for domestic violence against Peters in Montreal, Quebec in July 2013. Someone at the couple's hotel overheard a dispute coming from their room and called police, who arrived to find Peters with a bloody nose and several bite marks.Roberts was released several hours after her arrest when Peters declined to press charges.In a joint statement, Roberts and Peters called it \"an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding,\" and stated that they \"are working together to move past it.\"Media reports on January 6, 2014 said they had become engaged over the holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Roberts Dating Timeline; Pictures of Boyfriend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot HD Emma Roberts
