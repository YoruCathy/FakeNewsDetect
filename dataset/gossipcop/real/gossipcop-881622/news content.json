They are very strict. They avoided any sugars, anything sweet, no dairy, just more vegetables.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there I was trying to stick to the brief and I realized as I started adding more ingredients in, they said \u2018Your food is getting better.\u2019 That\u2019s what happens when you eat more than grass.\u201d\n\nPaltrow has talked about some of the crazy diet fads she\u2019s tested out in the past. At the beginning of the year, she told Shape about a cleanse she tested out for Goop, where she\u2019s known as the \u201cguinea pig\u201d because she\u2019ll \u201ctry anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just tried a goat milk cleanse for eight days to rid my system of parasites. That was really interesting. It's only goat's milk and herbs,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cThe theory is that we all have parasites, and they love the milk protein. So if you eat nothing else, they all come out of the intestinal wall and then you kill them with the herbs. I had to try it for Goop, but I felt so good after it. But usually, I just try to eat pretty clean during the day\u2014good proteins and lots of vegetables and not too much grain or sugar, and nothing baked\u2014and then I tend to eat whatever I want for dinner.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nShe also said that sometimes it\u2019s hard to make time to cook during the week with her busy schedule so she keeps a few healthy options ready-made in the fridge. \u201cI have a bunch of chicken dishes and pasta go-tos, and I do a lot of stir-fry for the kids. I always keep cooked brown rice in the fridge. Then it takes two minutes to chop up some vegetables, make a nice sauce, and you're done.\u201d\n\nA representative for Paltrow wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment.", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/fox-news-lifestyle_fox-news-lifestyle.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/tiger-cow-2-Jam-Press.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/fashion-nova.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Tunnel2Towers-on-2020-04-15-at-10.21.00_05_58_13.Still001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gwyneth-paltrow-reuters-2-resized.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/gwyneth-paltrow-reuters-2-resized.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/blockdown-photo-504027.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gwyneth-paltrow-reuters-2-resized.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/gwyneth-paltrow-and-chris-martins-former-chef-claim-they-eat-nothing", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's former chef claim they 'eat nothing'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "She says the celebrity couple had very strict diets", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "food-drink", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's former chef claim they 'eat nothing'", "dcterms.abstract": "She says the celebrity couple had very strict diets", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "She says the celebrity couple had very strict diets", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:4220b8d8-3aef-5385-a74a-1c667fc5f599", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-09-20", "dcterms.created": "2017-09-20T16:35:27-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-09-20T16:44:27-04:00", "og": {"title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's former chef claim they 'eat nothing'", "description": "She says the celebrity couple had very strict diets", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gwyneth-paltrow-reuters-2-resized.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/gwyneth-paltrow-and-chris-martins-former-chef-claim-they-eat-nothing", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's former chef claim they 'eat nothing'", "description": "She says the celebrity couple had very strict diets", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/gwyneth-paltrow-reuters-2-resized.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/gwyneth-paltrow-and-chris-martins-former-chef-claim-they-eat-nothing"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/FOOD DRINK/FOOD/Extreme Foods,/FOX NEWS/FOOD DRINK", "classification-isa": "extremefoods,food-drink"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
