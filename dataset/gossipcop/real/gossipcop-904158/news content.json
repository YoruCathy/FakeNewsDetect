Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family until the project is released.\u201d\n\nFeldman\u2019s allegations of pedophilia in Hollywood have resurfaced in light of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and director James Toback.\n\nThe \u201cStand By Me\u201d actor\u2019s 2013 appearance on \u201cThe View,\u201d in which Barbara Walters chided him for speaking out against \u201can entire industry,\u201d went viral last year.\n\nThe news of Haim\u2019s portrayal in Feldman\u2019s film may not sit well with the late actor\u2019s mother.\n\nJudy Haim previously slammed Feldman for speaking of Corey Haim\u2019s alleged sexual assault and abuse, even sending him a cease and desist in 2016, after which Feldman promised he\u2019d stop talking about Corey Haim in the press.\n\nShe was particularly incensed at reports that a then-19-year-old Charlie Sheen allegedly raped Corey Haim when Haim was 13 on the set of \u201cLucas,\u201d an accusation Sheen himself has denied \u2014 and sued over.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/corey-feldman-corey-haim.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/corey-feldman-corey-haim.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/corey-feldman-corey-haim.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/10/23/corey-feldman-titles-sex-abuse-film-truth-the-rape-of-2-coreys/", "title": "Corey Feldman titles sex abuse film \u2018Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
