The rest of the clip tells the story of a couple who met, fell in love, married and had a child before one partner tragically passed away.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes peek shared by E! News, Ballerini detailed the inspiration behind the song, noting that while she wrote it from a breakup, the song's general message is one of loss. \"It brings me back to the heartbreak I wrote it from, it makes me think of my fans and the journey we've shared, and now I sing it from the perspective of a legendary love story,\" she said. \"I hope everyone hears something in it that brings them to a place of nostalgia and is as excited as I am to begin this next chapter together.\"\n\nMore: Kelsea Ballerini Makes Unexpected Announcement on Social Media During a recent press event in Nashville, the 23-year-old shared that she had a vision for the music video the moment she heard the song's demo. \"I wrote this song two years ago, and the day we wrote it, Forest sent me the demo,\" she explained, via Billboard. \"I listened to it, and all I could see was a car wreck. God willing, I\u2019ve never had anyone close to me in a car wreck or anything like that, but it was a really strong visual that I saw. I think to me it made the song more about general loss than heartbreak. I wanted the song to be bigger than heartbreak. I think the video captured that.\"\n\nBallerini recently announced that her second album, Unapologetically, will be released Nov. 3.\n\nPhoto Credit: YouTube / KelseaBalleriniVEVO", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/country-music/2017/07/26/kelsea-ballerini-legends-music-video-behind-the-scenes/", "title": "Watch: Kelsea Ballerini Is Legendary in New Behind-the-Scenes Look at 'Legends' Video", "meta_data": {"description": "Kelsea Ballerini released her latest single, 'Legends,' in June, and the accompanying music video dropped soon after to give fans a taste of what they could expect from the country star's sophomore album.The sweeping song details an epic love story that came to an end, and while listeners may have [...]", "keywords": "Kelsea Ballerini,Country Music,Celebrity News,Celebrities", "news_keywords": "Kelsea Ballerini,Country Music,Celebrity News,Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@PopCulture", "creator": "@PopCulture", "title": "Watch: Kelsea Ballerini Is Legendary in New Behind-the-Scenes Look at 'Legends' Video", "description": "Kelsea Ballerini released her latest single, 'Legends,' in June, and the accompanying music video [...]", "image": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"}, "og": {"title": "Watch: Kelsea Ballerini Is Legendary in New Behind-the-Scenes Look at 'Legends' Video", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/country-music/2017/07/26/kelsea-ballerini-legends-music-video-behind-the-scenes/", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Country Music", "description": "Kelsea Ballerini released her latest single, 'Legends,' in June, and the accompanying music video [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nGa2-kOW810"], "publish_date": 1500998400.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
