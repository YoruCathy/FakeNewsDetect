The Star Wars actor recalls the shock of finding out about Fisher and Harrison Ford\u2019s secret affair and the pain of losing his longtime friend\n\nHan Solo is dead and Princess Leia, heartbreakingly, died almost a year ago, when Carrie Fisher died after becoming ill on a flight from London, as she was going home for Christmas. Which means, out of the original Star Wars trio, the most holy of cinematic trinities, Luke Skywalker is the last one standing. This is not how anyone expected it to end, least of all Luke himself, Mark Hamill. So, while the latest entry in the Star Wars canon, The Last Jedi, written and directed by Rian Johnson, is great fun \u2013 as exciting and inspired as its predecessor, JJ Abrams\u2019 The Force Awakens, but a lot funnier and without all the heavy-lifting of exposition and character setup that Abrams\u2019s film had to cram in \u2013 it is also very poignant.\n\nNo one could have foreseen Fisher\u2019s death and, in fact, she was going to be the centre of the next movie, just as Ford was the heart of The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi is very much Hamill\u2019s film. But there are moments in this movie that feel, in retrospect, breathtakingly prescient. The scenes between Luke and Leia after their long separation made my throat catch. I cannot imagine what it must be like for Hamill to watch them, his last on-screen moments with the woman who, for 40 years, was his on-screen sister and his off-screen friend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating and I still haven\u2019t come to terms with it,\u201d he says, when we meet in a hotel in central London, hours before the UK premiere. \u201cGosh darn it, I still think of her in the present tense, you know? If she were here right now, she\u2019d be behind you giving you bunny ears and me the middle finger because she was all about having fun all the time. Whenever I was on set, I would go straight to her trailer with my dog and hang out with her and her dog.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hamill with Carrie Fisher in the first Star Wars film in 1977. Photograph: Pi/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHamill and Fisher bonded almost instantly when they met, after being cast in Star Wars, and Hamill suggested the two of them go out for supper to get to \u201cknow each other a bit\u201d. Within 10 minutes, Fisher, who would become one of Hollywood\u2019s consummate memoirists, was telling him such intimate details about her father Eddie Fisher\u2019s infamous affair with Elizabeth Taylor that Hamill felt the hairs on his arms stand up.\n\nShortly before she died, Fisher published her memoir about making the Star Wars movies, in which she revealed that she had had an intense and rather tragic affair with Ford, when she was 19 and riddled with insecurities, and he was 33 and married. Did Hamill know what was going on?\n\n\u201cMarcia [Lucas, Star Wars\u2019 editor and George Lucas\u2019s then wife] told me after we finished filming. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know before, as it probably really would have affected me. By the time I found out, I just thought it was hilarious. But you know men \u2013 even if we don\u2019t want to have a relationship, it\u2019s just in our nature to jockey for affection,\u201d he says.\n\nBut it sounds like there was some jockeying going on anyway, even if neither of the men was aware of the game. It turns out that Fisher kept one last secret.\n\n\u201cCarrie and I were attracted to one another, but I knew from previous jobs that it would have been a bad idea [to get involved with someone on set]. But Carrie and I found pretexts. I remember one time \u2013 I\u2019m sure alcohol was involved \u2013 we were talking about kissing techniques. I said: \u2018Well, I think I\u2019m a fairly good kisser. I like to let the women come to me rather than be aggressive.\u2019 And she said: \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Well, next thing you know we\u2019re making out like teenagers!\u201d\n\nWait a minute. Luke and Leia \u2013 got it on? During the filming of the first Star Wars?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hamill as Luke Skywalker in the latest in the canon, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Photograph: John Wilson/AP\n\n\u201cOh, yeah! Are you kidding me? We were all over each other!\u201d he cackles. \u201cBut the one thing that drew Carrie and me back from the precipice was we kind of became aware of what we were doing and just burst out laughing. Which was unfortunate for me because the rocket launch sequence had been initiated,\u201d he grins. And just like that, I spit my water all over Luke Skywalker\u2019s knee.\n\nWhereas in his 70s youth, Hamill, who was born and raised in California, was bright-eyed and blond, like Bj\u00f6rn Borg\u2019s earnest younger brother, he now has a handsome grizzle to him, with a rather endearing paunch. He is a little shambly and a lot rambly, and where he once looked callow, he now looks kind. Which he is, urging me to have the comfortable armchair while he takes the desk chair and sweetly encouraging my hackneyed Star Wars analogies about Donald Trump and Darth Vader, all of which he must have heard a million times before. (Hamill is a very vocal Trump critic, a fighter in the resistance both on and off-screen.)\n\nHe is a testament to the value of the quieter life: while Ford and Fisher went on to become Hollywood superstars, and had the requisite Hollywood divorces along the way, Hamill lives with his wife of 40 years and their three children in a house in Malibu, and he looks happy and healthy. While he has done theatre and voiceover work, including playing the Joker in Batman: the Animated Series, he is only known, really, for one movie character, and he is good with that. Ford generally looks as if he would rather have a root canal without anaesthetic than talk about Star Wars, but Hamill is as much of a nerd as the fans, and could talk about it all day. Yet our conversation keeps going back to Fisher.\n\nAfter they got their make out session \u201cout of our system\u201d, he says, they became lifelong friends.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hamill with Yoda in Star Wars \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back, 1980. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/LucasFilm\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t her best friend \u2013 she had so many friends and I\u2019d go to parties with her and I would be the only one there I\u2019d never heard of. But there was a comfort level that we\u2019d achieved because she knew I wasn\u2019t ever angling for a favour or trying to get her to introduce me to this agent or this director. We became like real siblings over the years,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd just like siblings, they could also infuriate one another. He would occasionally accuse her of being self-centred (\u201cAlthough, come on, what actor isn\u2019t,\u201d he concedes), while she sometimes thought he could be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud. When George Lucas told them that Disney was making another trilogy, Fisher immediately slammed her hand down on the table and announced, \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d (She then asked if there were any roles in it for her daughter, Billie Lourd, a hustling stage mom to the end.) When Lucas left the room, Hamill turned to her and hissed: \u201cCarrie! Poker face!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, as usual, she was miles ahead of me because she said to me: \u2018Mark, what kind of roles do you think there are in Hollywood for women over 50?\u2019 And I thought: \u2018She\u2019s right again.\u2019 Women have it so much harder,\u201d he says.\n\nAs time has passed, it has become only more apparent how much Hamill, Fisher and Ford resemble their Star Wars characters. \u201cGeorge [Lucas] casts people who are so close to what he wants so he doesn\u2019t have to go in and do a lot of backstory and motivation,\u201d Hamill says. \u201cCarrie was Hollywood royalty, Harrison had been around and was\u201d \u2013 he now breaks off to do a bang-on imitation of a grumpy and mumbling Ford \u2013 \u201can excellent eye-roller. And I was bright and bouncy, and fairly clueless.\u201d\n\nBut when they were cast, it was Hamill who was seen as the bigger star as he had more acting experience. So, whereas Ford got a grand total of $10,000 for Star Wars, Hamill got $650,000 plus 0.025% of the movie\u2019s profits (which presumably explains the massive Malibu house). Forty years later, when they reunited for The Force Awakens, their pay cheques reflected how the situation had changed: Ford reportedly got $25m plus 0.5% of the profit and Hamill got what was described as \u201ca low seven-figure salary\u201d.\n\nThe general theory about why Hamill\u2019s career didn\u2019t take off the way many expected after Star Wars is that directors couldn\u2019t see past Luke Skywalker. When he asked Milo\u0161 Forman if he could audition to play Amadeus, after having played the role on stage, Forman laughed and \u2013 according to Hamill, who does a very funny imitation of the Czech director \u2013 said: \u201cNo, no, no! Because the people are not to be believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart!\u201d And yet the people are to be believing that the Han Solo is anyone he wants to be. Surely Hamill must have found this infuriating?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hamill in Star Wars, 1977. Photograph: Allstar/LucasFilm\n\n\u201cWell, it is what it is. It\u2019s been so illuminating to me that I don\u2019t need the spotlight, you know, and the bows and all that. I was just grateful to get the opportunities,\u201d he shrugs.\n\nReally?\n\n\u201cSure! I look at how Star Wars has become a part of the pop culture and it is just astonishing to me. People tell me stories about getting through their mother\u2019s terminal illness or naming their kids Luke and Leia and I\u2019m just taken aback at how it\u2019s inspired people,\u201d he says with so much wide-eyed sweetness that I actually believe him.\n\nBut being known for one character has made Hamill, understandably, protective of the franchise. Although he knows it now has to be handed down to the younger generation, the \u201cirrational side\u201d of him winces a little: \u201cOnce I was the orphan discovering hidden powers, but that\u2019s someone else now. I was the cocky pilot, but they got that covered, too. Once I was sneaking around in enemy territory, now it\u2019s other characters. It\u2019s not rational, but I feel like a bunch of strangers are rummaging around in my toy box, playing with my toys,\u201d he says.\n\nGiven that he is now acting in movies written by Johnson and Abrams, who were kids when the original movies came out, does he feel as if he is acting in their fan fiction?\n\n\u201cYeah, kinda!\u201d he laughs. \u201cI said to Rian: \u2018I\u2019m sure 30 years ago you were playing with little figures of me, making up stories on a little play set. And now here it is, writ large.\u2019\u201d\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi review \u2013 an explosive thrill-ride of galactic proportions Read more\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s toys presumably didn\u2019t argue back, as Hamill made a point of doing. When he first read the script, he disagreed with \u201calmost everything\u201d Johnson had written, starting with Luke\u2019s self-imposed isolation on an island on the planet of Ahch-To.\n\n\u201cEven if I was traumatised by something, I might take a year of meditation, but he would double down and come back harder. Jedis don\u2019t give up!\u201d he says, switching, as he often does when talking about Luke, between the first and third person. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my story any more and I just have to accept that. And I then bonded very deeply with Rian, but I had to let him know how I felt.\u201d\n\nYet, whether it is Johnson\u2019s script or Hamill\u2019s maturity, he has never been better than he is in the new movie, playing the grumpy elder statesman, alternating easily between solemnity and wisecracks. It is a truly triumphant comeback, and, given that Fisher won\u2019t be back in the next Star Wars, it seems a safe bet that Hamill will be, although he is coy about answering. But the question makes him think, inevitably, about Fisher again.\n\n\u201cYou know, as tough and verbally caustic as she was, the way she used words as a weapon, there was also a side to her that was really vulnerable, like a little girl. And that brought out the protectiveness in me,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just appalled that they didn\u2019t let it rest in peace and they were talking about her autopsy and all of that stuff. When I think of her I don\u2019t think of her \u2026 of her \u2026 failings. I think of how triumphant she was. She could be completely infuriating, but she could also make you feel like the most important person in the world. I mean, if I\u2019d had a relationship with her, it would have been like a full-time activity because she was too much for me in every regard: she was too creative, she was too smart. She was just the best.\u201d And he suddenly looks completely stricken, like a brother who has lost his sister, a man who has lost his friend.\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi is in cinemas now", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Hadley-Freeman,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4d844b0898c9843e66953e28eb8b0133", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a42be9788c99e606d23a3463c42b23ade929d9/0_0_1806_1199/master/1806.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e4037dec01fde0091aa0c19fbab148f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23aeb1f7ff20bb80f68852da17743b0e557f8ed/0_0_3504_2359/master/3504.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=261bc427e9a8b4252dd03a78d6949306", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b504cce2df8327b03ec71f4e0faf29cd8f9cdb/0_18_4621_2772/master/4621.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca0b62e68c0353fcf8d1c2527743987a", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Star+Wars%3A+The+Last+Jedi%2CMark+Hamill%2CCarrie+Fisher%2CHarrison+Ford%2CRian+Johnson%2CFilm%2CScience+fiction+and+fantasy+films%2CCulture%2CStar+Wars", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3f93781f46f2d5fc5225bb80ea6977f73fd3494/0_196_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c5387150189dc332ebb62e18927788f5", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358ca4830d5f68c4a8f76e9da17d7347d921a805/0_0_4240_2832/master/4240.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffd3d0623d8d0a7b05c12a9ccbec29c0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b504cce2df8327b03ec71f4e0faf29cd8f9cdb/0_18_4621_2772/master/4621.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb5e7474bad23de3193cf17233a39127"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b504cce2df8327b03ec71f4e0faf29cd8f9cdb/0_18_4621_2772/master/4621.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca0b62e68c0353fcf8d1c2527743987a", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hadley Freeman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/14/star-wars-the-last-jedi-mark-hamill-carrie-fisher-good-kisser", "title": "Star Wars' Mark Hamill \u2013 \u2018I said to Carrie Fisher: I\u2019m a good kisser \u2013 next, we\u2019re making out like teenagers!\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Luke Skywalker is back in The Last Jedi \u2013 and it\u2019s a triumphant return.
