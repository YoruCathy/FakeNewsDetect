Despite having their relationship under heavy scrutiny by the international press, the couple has made a valiant attempt at keeping their romance as private as possible, appearing in public just a handful of times together since confirming their union.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the royal relationship on everyone\u2019s lips:\n\nHow did Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet?\n\nPrince Harry, 33, and Los Angeles-born Markle, 36, met for the first time in London in July 2016, when they were introduced by a mutual friend, Markle confirmed in an interview with Vanity Fair in September.\n\nHow long have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle dated?\n\nA close friend of Harry\u2019s confirmed to PEOPLE in late October 2016 that the pair had been dating seriously for around two months, meaning as of Nov. 2017 the pair have been together for roughly 15 months.\n\nOn Nov. 8 2016, the Royal Kensington Palace released a public statement in which Markle was referred to as Harry\u2019s girlfriend for the first time. The unprecedented statement condemned the \u201cwave of abuse and harassment\u201d Markle had been subjected to. \u201cPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle\u2019s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm.\u201d\n\nWhen have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared together in public?\n\nPrince Harry and Markle were photographed in public together for the first time in Dec. 2016, shopping for a Christmas tree at the Pines and Needles store in London. A few days later they were spotted while on a date to see the hit play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time in London\u2019s West End. The week before, Harry had made a 1,700-mile detour from his tour of the Caribbean to visit Markle at her Toronto home.\n\nMarkle attended her first public event with Harry in May this year, at the Coworth Park Polo Club in Ascot, England. Later that month, she attended part of the wedding of Kate Middleton\u2019s sister, Pippa, to financier James Matthews. Harry was photographed driving the actress into the Middleton home later that day after picking her up from London after the ceremony. In March, Markle joined Prince Harry at a wedding in Jamaica for one of his close friends.\n\nThe pair made their first public appearance together at the opening ceremony of the international Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada, in September. They held hands at a wheelchair tennis event and spent time with Markle\u2019s mother, Doria.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry attend wheelchair tennis on day 3 of the Invictus Games Toronto 2017 on September 25, 2017 in Toronto, Canada. Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nWhat have they said about each other?\n\nMarkle commented on her relationship for the first time in September, in her interview with Vanity Fair in which she referred to Harry as her \u201cboyfriend\u201d numerous times. \u201cWe\u2019re a couple,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cWe\u2019re in love. I\u2019m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis is for us. It\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry has not commented about the relationship quite as candidly as Markle; however, he did tell competitors at the Invictus Games in September that his girlfriend was \u201cloving\u201d the event. \u201cI asked him how his girlfriend was enjoying it and he said \u2018she loves it, she\u2019s loving the games,\u2019 which is awesome,\u201d former U.S. air force master sergeant Kyle Burnett told reporters. It was the first time the Prince publicly spoke about Markle following the strongly-worded statement the Kensington Palace issued in November.\n\nThe pair have hinted at their feelings towards each other in non-vocal ways. In February this year, Prince Harry was seen wearing his half of a matching His & Hers bracelet set on the cover of Town and Country magazine. The resemblance of the blue-beaded piece of jewelry to a bracelet Markle was pictured wearing on her Instagram page two months before was no coincidence.\n\nWhat will Prince Harry and Markle\u2019s wedding be like?\n\nThe event will take place in Spring 2018, but details about the nuptials remain under wraps. Prince Harry and Markle could opt for a large royal wedding like Prince William and Duchess Kate\u2019s 2011 nuptials or choose a low-key ceremony somewhere outside of London, such as St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Harry\u2019s father, Prince Charles, had a service of blessing with his second wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, in 2005.\n\nAs for the honeymoon, Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister invited Harry to spend his honeymoon on the Caribbean islands of Antigua and Barbuda during a visit in Nov. 2016 (making the royal turn \u201cbright red,\u201d according to sources on the ground). Sadly, the islands were badly hit by this year\u2019s hurricane season so the royal couple might have to look elsewhere.\n\nGet The Brief.
