You still with me? Do you want to help her up? If everyone could give a little bit of space. Just chill for one second, we'll get some people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Uproxx the fan, named Annie, recalled the \u201chorrendous\u201d incident in a series of tweets in which she referred to the young singer as \u201cpure\u201d.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cHarry Styles stopped his entire show because I got crushed and then watched me being pulled over the barrier. That was one of the most horrendous panic attacks I\u2019ve ever had, like even the medics were terrified of the state I was in.\n\n\u201cHarry is so f****** pure I can\u2019t believe it. I feel like f****** s*** but I\u2019m so grateful to Harry for having such a pure heart and stopping the show to get security to help me.\u201d\n\nOne Direction's Harry Styles - In pictures 55 show all One Direction's Harry Styles - In pictures 1/55 2020 Harry Styles performs on NBC's \"Today\" at Rockefeller Plaza AFP via Getty Images 2/55 The early days Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Zane Malik and Niall Horan of 'One Direction' attend a photocall during the X Factor press conference at the Connaught Hotel on December 9, 2010 Getty Images 3/55 Olympic moment Harry Styles of the One Direction band performs at the Olympic stadium during the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games in London on August 12, 2012 AFP/Getty Images 4/55 Front row Harry Styles, Nick Grimshaw and Kelly Osbourne attend the House Of Holland show during London Fashion Week SS14 on September 14, 2013 in London Getty Images 5/55 Harry's hair-Styles Harry Styles of One Direction performs on stage at CenturyLink Field on July 15, 2015 in Seattle Getty Images 6/55 Young direction Rex Features 7/55 2010 Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik arrive for an autograph signing session at the HMV store, Bradford PA 8/55 2010 Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Zain Malik and Louis Tomlinson of 'One Direction' attends the Very.co.uk Christmas Catwalk Show at Victoria House on November 24, 2010 in London Getty Images 9/55 2010 Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Cher Lloyd and Niall Horan sighted getting some snacks before returning to an X Factor recording studio on October 4, 2010 in London Getty Images 10/55 2010 Harry Styles attends the Royal Film Performance and World Premiere of 'The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader' at Odeon Leicester Square on November 30, 2010 in London Getty Images 11/55 2011 Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne of 'One Direction' attend the GQ Men Of The Year Awards at The Royal Opera House on September 6, 2011 in London Getty Images 12/55 2012 Harry Styles celebrates after winning best British Single for What Makes You Beautiful during the 2012 Brit awards at The O2 Arena, London PA 13/55 2012 Harry Styles of One Direction attends \"El Hormiguero\" Tv show at Vertice Studio on October 31, 2012 in Madrid, Spain Getty Images 14/55 2012 One Direction attend Nickelodeon Hosts Orange Carpet Premiere For Original TV Movie \"Big Time Movie\" Starring Big Time Rush at 583 Park Avenue on March 8, 2012 in New York City Getty Images 15/55 2013 Harry Styles of \"One Direction\" attends a photo call and press conference for \"One Direction This Is Us\" at Big Sky Studios on August 19, 2013 in London Getty Images 16/55 2013 Harry Styles attends the Teen Choice Awards 2013 at Gibson Amphitheatre on August 11, 2013 in Universal City, California Getty Images 17/55 2013 Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Harry Styles of One Direction pose with their Brits Global Success Award in the press room at the Brit Awards 2013 at the 02 Arena on February 20, 2013 in London Getty Images 18/55 2013 Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction perform on stage during the Brit Awards 2013 at the 02 Arena on February 20, 2013 in London Getty Images 19/55 2013 Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Mailik and Naill Horan in TriStar Pictures' \"One Direction: This Is Us.\" 20/55 2013 Harry Styles attends the British Fashion Awards 2013 at London Coliseum on December 2, 2013 in London Getty Images 21/55 2013 Niall Horan,Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik of One Direction perform at Rumsey Playfield on November 26, 2013 in New York City Getty Images 22/55 2013 Simon Cowell and Harry Styles attend the \"One Direction This Is Us\" world premiere after party on August 20, 2013 in London Getty Images 23/55 2013 Harry Styles with the British Style bought to you by Vodaphone Award poses in the winners room at the British Fashion Awards 2013 at London Coliseum on December 2, 2013 in London Getty Images 24/55 2014 Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan of One Direction, winner of the British Video and Global Success BRIT awards, pose in the winners room at The BRIT Awards 2014 at 02 Arena on February 19, 2014 in London Getty Images 25/55 2014 Harry Styles from One Direction poses with fans at the 28th Annual ARIA Awards 2014 at the Star on November 26, 2014 in Sydney Getty Images 26/55 2014 Harry Styles accepts the Favorite Pop/Rock Album award for 'Midnight Memories' onstage at the 2014 American Music Awards at Nokia Theatre L.A.
