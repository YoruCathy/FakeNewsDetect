Of Azalea, the singer said, \"She had a complete disregard for black culture. F---king moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.\"\n\nIn response, Azalea told Smallzy, \"I thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there, but she's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she's kind of in the same shoes. I'm sure she's getting judged all the time as well by people who don't really know her. So I think maybe it'd be good for her to try to be a little more empathetic to other people that are in the same situation.\"\n\nListen to the full interview here.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?4863e69cb9d656c61185", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Stutz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7849211/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-06-28T13:01:41-04:00", "published_time": "2017-06-27T18:45:51-04:00"}, "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "og": {"description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her' | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7849211/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498603551.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
