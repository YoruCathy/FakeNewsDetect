Premiering on 4 December 2011, the first two series aired on British network Channel 4, as did the special \"White Christmas\", whereas the following three series were released on the American streaming platform Netflix. There are twenty-two episodes in the show's first five series, and an additional interactive film Bandersnatch has also been released.[1] Inspired by The Twilight Zone, each episode of Black Mirror is standalone and explores the common theme of technology and its side-effects.[2]\n\nBlack Mirror has received positive reception from critics[a] and has been nominated for eighty-four awards, winning twenty-five of them. The most acclaimed episodes are \"USS Callister\", which won four Emmy Awards, and \"San Junipero\", which won two. Additionally, the interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch won two Emmy Awards. As actors rarely appear in more than one episode, the only people to receive multiple awards for their work on the show are writer Charlie Brooker, who has won six, and executive producer Annabel Jones, who has won three. The series has been nominated for fourteen British Academy Film Awards, winning two, and fifteen Emmy Awards, winning nine.\n\nStatistics [ edit ]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nThirteen of the show's twenty-two episodes have received awards or nominations, including those given to specific people for their work on the episode.
