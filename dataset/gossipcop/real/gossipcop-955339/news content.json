Selena dated Nick from 2008 to 2010, while Taylor dated Joe in 2008\u2014but was notoriously dumped in a phone call months later. Although those relationships didn't last, the one between Selena and Taylor remains stronger than ever.\n\n\"We actually dated the Jonas Brothers together! It was hysterical,\" Gomez recalled her first time meeting Swift in a new radio interview with KIIS FM UK.\n\n\"It was amazing, because she was the girl with the big curly hair and all the bracelets and the cowboy boots. And I was definitely up-and-coming, and we just clicked,\" she added. \"It was the best thing we got out of those relationships.\"\n\nThey still keep in touch with the Jonases, however. \"They're lovely, by the way,\" Gomez said. \"We're all friends now. We were young, you know. It's a different time.\"\n\nThis isn't Gomez's first time opening up about her and Swift's friendship. In March 2016, she said of her fellow star: \"I've known her for 10 years, she's been one of my best friends through thick and thin, walked by my side.\"\n\nShe added that Swift is \"known for embracing her personal story and creating a beautiful thing out of it, and I was a little hesitant with that\u2014and she was always the person to encourage me to tell my story and be proud of who I am.\"\n\nSwift showed the feeling was mutual while speaking to E! in May 2014. \"Both of us have kind of stuck it out and hung in there through all the different changes we've gone through,\" she said. The singer added that their friendship is \"the longest one I think either of us have had.\"\n\nSelena and Taylor made their first red carpet appearance together in 2008, at the Another Cinderella Story premiere:\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd here they are at their latest red carpet appearance, at the 2016 Grammy Awards:\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs the superstars continue to promote their new music, we're sure we'll be seeing a lot more joint appearances from them in the near future.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a14379317/how-selena-gomez-taylor-swift-became-friends/", "title": "Selena Gomez Opens Up About the First Time She Met Taylor Swift", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Selena Gomez Opens Up About the First Time She Met Taylor Swift", "description": "\"It was hysterical.\"", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a14379317/how-selena-gomez-taylor-swift-became-friends/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2017-12-07 04:02:58", "published_time": "2017-12-07 03:15:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "How Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift Became Friends - Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift Friendship", "description": "Selena Gomez credits her friendship with Taylor Swift to their two famous ex-boyfriends.", "keywords": "selena gomez, taylor swift, joe jonas, nick jonas, selena gomez and taylor swift friends, taylor swift dated joe jonas, selena gomez dated nick jonas", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.285xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-07T15:15:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-selena-taylor-518985974-1512658269.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.285xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Selena Gomez Opens Up About the First Time She Met Taylor Swift", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512587700.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
