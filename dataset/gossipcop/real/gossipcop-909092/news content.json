Or is she poised, polished and a quiet, but supportive, first lady? Who is the real Melania? Very few, at least among those who are speaking publicly, will say. \u201cI\u2019m very strong. People, they don\u2019t really know me. People think and talk about me like, \u2018Oh, Melania. Oh, poor Melania.\u2019 Don\u2019t feel sorry for me. Don\u2019t feel sorry for me. I can handle everything.\u201d But as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has progressed, the first lady has become a versatile avatar, her image split sharply down political lines. In one version of the public imagination, Melania is unhappy. She dislikes her husband and disagrees with his policies. She may even be mulling a divorce. This Melania has shown up on late-night TV and in tabloids. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, dutiful Melania. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d Then there\u2019s the other version of Melania, painted by conservative media as confident, fashion forward, graceful and adored. \u201cI have been so impressed with, not just her quiet dignity, as you brought up, but also just this diplomatic use of fashion.\u201d This version is closer to the official portrayal of Melania. Through her spokespeople, the first lady says she is supportive of her husband and focused on raising their son, Barron. \u201cI support my husband 100 percent. But we have a 9-year-old son together, Barron. And I\u2019m raising him.\u201d She says she prefers to take a back seat to her husband, to keep his place in the limelight. It\u2019s not the first time Melania\u2019s been in the public eye. \u201cYou spin, baby, you spin.\u201d She\u2019s a former model and jewelry designer. \u201cI love when idea comes to life. And I study architecture and design and it\u2019s something very creative for me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about what I design, and there are some beautiful pieces.\u201d When they got together in the late 1990s, the Trumps say their chemistry was instant. \u201cWe were both at the same party and that\u2019s how we met. He came to me...\u201d \u201cLike her right away?\u201d \u201cI went crazy.\u201d Melania and Donald became synonymous with the New York social scene. \u201cThey\u2019ve stood did together for a number of years now. New Yorkers have come to know them as a very solid couple.\u201d And in 2005, they married. \u201cHi, fans. I\u2019m going to Metropolitan Gala.\u201d In the following years, Melania\u2019s social media posts focused on fashion, travel, fitness and spending time with family. Now as the first lady, next to one of the most outspoken presidents in recent history, Melania\u2019s silence has taken on a life of its own. \u201cThe most important thing is just to be you. That\u2019s the end.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/multimedia/author-julie-hirschfeld-davis/author-julie-hirschfeld-davis-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-katie-rogers/author-katie-rogers-thumbLarge-v2.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-1/00dc-MELANIA-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top-sub/00dc-MELANIA-top-sub-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Rogers", "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Maggie Haberman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "title": "Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-08-17T09:00:24.000Z", "modified": "2019-11-26T22:10:29.558Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006051129, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/09d1999a-226a-5950-a56c-f377ba744e2c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/db13ea56d03a4b70a867f4e5eb306259", "description": "On many matters, Mrs. Trump has directed her East Wing to operate independently of the West Wing, and she is still keeping Washington at a distance.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Katie Rogers, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie Haberman", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Melania Trump,Donald Trump,First Ladies,Trump Tower,White House,Fashion,US Politics", "pdate": 20180817, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "type": "article", "title": "Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Allies describe Mrs. Trump as warm, engaging and witty, traits at odds with the totemic stance she often takes in public."}, "description": "On many matters, Mrs. Trump has directed her East Wing to operate independently of the West Wing, and she is still keeping Washington at a distance."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "title": "Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House", "description": "On many matters, Mrs. Trump has directed her East Wing to operate independently of the West Wing, and she is still keeping Washington at a distance.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Allies describe Mrs. Trump as warm, engaging and witty, traits at odds with the totemic stance she often takes in public."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/09d1999a-226a-5950-a56c-f377ba744e2c"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "CN": "donald-trump-white-house", "CT": "news-event", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/09d1999a-226a-5950-a56c-f377ba744e2c", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534435200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
