The 53-year-old emcee asked the actor to elaborate what the \u201chamster rescues\u201d were that she used to embark upon in childhood, E! News reported.\n\n\u201cIs that a British thing that we don\u2019t know about or is that what it sounds like?\u201d The Late Show Thursday host questioned.\n\nA Quiet Place actor then explained how she used to have a \u201cdramatic role-play\u201d with her \u201cpoor\u201d pet hamster, Tigger, which may have led to his early death. \u201cI quite enjoyed rather dramatic role-play game. My friends were like, \u2018That sounds lame, but I\u2019ll go along with it because I\u2019m at your house, and I kinda have to do it.\u2019 I had this lovely hamster called Tigger, who probably died before he should have died because of what I put him through. We would sort of hide Tigger under a sofa cushion, and then I\u2019d sort of pretend the roof was coming in. And I\u2019d be like, \u2018Get Tigger! The roof is falling in!\u2019 I\u2019d dive and I\u2019d rescue Tigger - and Tigger would just be, like... (in a daze),\u201d Blunt said.\n\nRead: Baaghi 2 movie review: Goa bears Tiger Shroff\u2019s wrath and so do we\n\nShe, however, admitted, \u201cIt was awful!\u201d\n\nColbert, then asked, \u201cWere there adults watching you do this at the time?\u201d To which the actor replied, \u201cMy mum had four kids. \u201cI think she was like, \u2018They sound like they\u2019re OK.\u2019\u201c\n\nThe host quipped, \u201cTorturing animals is one of the signs of a sociopath. Generally we get those kids medication now.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_5cc396f6-81d5-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/ht-copy.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/18/Pictures/_92be7060-8193-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/img/app-images/HomePageV1/zero.gif", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/outbreak-hyderabad-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-in_045417ee-8206-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/2019/4/authors/logo-ht.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/htlogo.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/2019/4/authors/source_weather-cm.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2018/03/31/Pictures/90th-academy-awards-oscars-arrivals-hollywood_9a31a288-34c2-11e8-a509-12b0194ead35.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/bunglow-addressing-minster-bhushan-thackeray-maharashtra-koyande_ce50ca06-821a-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/patna-lockdown-covid-19-day-25_93525a58-8226-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/default_author.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_f6dd0ab2-81fb-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_4d5b663a-821b-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.png", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/18d72aacafe84701a5b30e418a8a6611/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/security-in-srinagar_0ca25600-8200-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/18/Pictures/_72977f38-814e-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/05/Pictures/90th-academy-awards-oscars-arrivals-hollywood_8e8d69f0-201b-11e8-925c-925443ac9dfa.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_043731aa-822a-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/18/Pictures/_d3987496-8152-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/cricket-india-cuttack-england-2nd-odi-at_9fd44888-8201-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035286&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/05/Pictures/90th-academy-awards-oscars-arrivals-hollywood_8e8d69f0-201b-11e8-925c-925443ac9dfa.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Press Trust Of India"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/stephen-colbert-jokes-emily-blunt-might-be-a-sociopath-on-his-show/story-fLpv2tgJmcJsaOKNX3S36H.html", "title": "Stephen Colbert jokes Emily Blunt might be a sociopath on his show", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "U3xIlrlaetYrU7V1lNSFthKZzBFJ_S6qVzdn_gpMNjc", "keywords": "Stephen Colbert, Emily Blunt, A Quiet Place, Hollywood, Actor", "news_keywords": "Stephen Colbert, Emily Blunt, A Quiet Place, Hollywood, Actor", "description": "The 53-year-old emcee asked the actor to elaborate what the \u201chamster rescues\u201d were that she used to embark upon in childhood.", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "type": "article", "title": "Stephen Colbert jokes Emily Blunt might be a sociopath on his show", "description": "The 53-year-old emcee asked the actor to elaborate what the \u201chamster rescues\u201d were that she used to embark upon in childhood.", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/stephen-colbert-jokes-emily-blunt-might-be-a-sociopath-on-his-show/story-fLpv2tgJmcJsaOKNX3S36H.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/05/Pictures/90th-academy-awards-oscars-arrivals-hollywood_8e8d69f0-201b-11e8-925c-925443ac9dfa.jpg", "width": 960, "height": 640}, "site_name": "Hindustan Times"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Stephen Colbert jokes Emily Blunt might be a sociopath on his show", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@httweets", "creator": "@httweets", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/stephen-colbert-jokes-emily-blunt-might-be-a-sociopath-on-his-show/story-fLpv2tgJmcJsaOKNX3S36H.html", "title": "Stephen Colbert jokes Emily Blunt might be a sociopath on his show -
