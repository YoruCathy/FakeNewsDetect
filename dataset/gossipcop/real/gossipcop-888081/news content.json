Jack Falahee, who plays sexually voracious law student Connor Walsh on ABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder, has officially gone on the record about his sexuality: He\u2019s straight, bros. Falahee\u2019s sexual identity has come under scrutiny mainly because he plays a gay man on the show; he has consistently batted the conversation away, he says, \u201cin an attempt to try and dismantle the closet.\u201d On Tuesday, spurred by the election of Donald Trump and the emotional reaction of a gay friend of his, the actor talked openly about his sexuality for the first time in a message posted on Twitter. Falahee writes:\n\nWhile I\u2019m not gay, on HTGAWM I play a character who\u2019s in an interracial relationship with an HIV positive man. However, in the past I\u2019ve declined to discuss my own sexuality in an attempt to try and dismantle the closet. Opponents to my ambiguous answers to questions surrounding my sexuality argued the importance of visibility. Ultimately, I think that my stance has been unhelpful in the fight for equality. I feel that I\u2019ve sacrificed my ability to support the community for a more theoretical discussion about sexuality. Now more than ever, I want to offer my support to the community as an ally.\n\nFalahee then goes on to list some things he plans on doing, such as donating money to a number of nonprofits including the Trevor Project, the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and a number of others.
