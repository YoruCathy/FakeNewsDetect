Television. Jackson is at the center of the scandal along with fellow contestant Corinne Olympios, amid tabloid reports about an inappropriate sexual encounter. Jackson broke his silence earlier this week, saying, \u201cMy character and family name has been assassinated this past week with false claims and malicious allegations.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Variety, Jackson\u2019s lawyer Walter Mosley says his client has suffered because of the recent swirl of coverage.\n\n\u201cThis has caused a lot of trauma \u2014 both physical and emotional injury,\u201d says Mosley. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for DeMario and his family. He\u2019s a celebrity for all the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nMosley says his focus is on clearing his client\u2019s name, and then exploring any legal remedies. While he declined to say whether he will be taking legal action against the studio, network or Olympios, Mosley did say that a potential case may came after he views the footage from \u201cBachelor In Paradise,\u201d which neither he nor Jackson have yet seen. \u201cI have requested the tapes and I\u2019m hoping to see the tapes next week,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tapes are the real facts needed to vindicate DeMario\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nGiven the serious nature of the complaints, Mosley says he supports the investigation, but says he questions the process given that the tapes should provide a clear answer.\n\n\u201cAs a lawyer, oftentimes, you\u2019re in a case where it\u2019s a he-said-she-said and there are parties with conflicting stories, and every once in a while, you\u2019re gifted with a story that the entire thing is caught on camera,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is one of those rare occasions because they were shooting a reality television show. For 20 or 30 people to get it wrong or to miss something, for seasoned professionals over at Warner Bros. and ABC to get it wrong and for some third party who never saw the tape and who wasn\u2019t on set at the time of the incident to make an accusation \u2014 as a lawyer, it\u2019s like Christmas.\u201d\n\nOlympios, who hired attorney Marty Singer earlier this week, says she has \u201clittle memory\u201d of the night in question. \u201cAs a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality,\u201d she said in a statement earlier this week. Olympios\u2019 publicist Stan Rosenfield tells Variety, \u201cCorinne has not seen the tapes.\u201d\n\nMosley says he is \u201cnot at liberty\u201d to share Jackson\u2019s side of the story, but says \u201cthere\u2019s no criminal investigation and we don\u2019t fear any criminal investigation.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t say whether he has heard from Olympios\u2019 camp, but said, \u201cDeMario is not the big fish in this situation.\u201d\n\nMosley also declined to share Jackson\u2019s version of the night\u2019s events, but he did challenge the timeline. He pointed to Olympios\u2019 statement, which reads, \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened the night of June 4,\u201d and explains that Jackson was not actually with Olympios during the \u201cnight.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mosley, Jackson\u2019s \u201cvery limited interaction\u201d with her happened around 5 p.m. \u201cThat\u2019s not at night \u2014 that\u2019s early evening,\u201d says Mosley. \u201cIf you read the account [in tabloids], they suggest that there were three other people who had similar hookups with Corinne throughout the night, after DeMario \u2014 none of which have been perceived like my client has, but those hookups would have happened at night.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s attorney would not say whether his client has been in touch with Olympios since the scandal broke, but says Jackson has her best interests in mind. \u201cHe has a great deal of respect for Corinne,\u201d Mosley says. \u201cThey were as friendly as castmates could be.\u201d\n\nBefore the \u201cBachelor In Paradise\u201d scandal, Jackson was portrayed as the villain on the current season of \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d A woman from his past was brought back on the show, and he was ultimately sent home.\n\nAsked if Jackson was put in a staged situation, Mosley says, \u201cI\u2019m sure if you asked him that, he\u2019d say they brought a girl from my past who I never knew and had a few text messages exchanged, but they paid her to come on and say that she\u2019s my girlfriend \u2014 she wasn\u2019t. But that\u2019s part of reality TV. You sign up for that, and that\u2019s the producers\u2019 job to find a girl that would come on and do that.\u201d\n\nMosley would not confirm whether Jackson lost his job this week, as has been reported, but says the combination of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cBachelor In Paradise\u201d has \u201cseriously damaged\u201d his client\u2019s reputation, due to a series of \u201cmissteps.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real joy working with DeMario. He\u2019s super smart, very witty, well educated, comes from a really great family,\u201d Mosley says. \u201cYou might read something or see him on \u2018The Bachelorette,\u2019 but the first thing about him is that he\u2019s just a good kid from a really good family. He has no record, has never been accused of anything like this, and no one that knows him would ever think he would be in this type of situation.\u201d", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fbachelor-in-paradise-demario-jackson-lawyer-interview-1202469321%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202469321&comment_count=15", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/demario-jackson-bachelor-in-paradise.jpg?w=1000", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/demario-jackson-bachelor-in-paradise.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Wagmeister"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bachelor-in-paradise-demario-jackson-lawyer-interview-1202469321/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Contestant DeMario Jackson\u2019s Lawyer Speaks Out (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Exclusive interview with DeMario Jackson's attorney Walter Mosley about \"Bachelor In Paradise\" scandal.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202469321, "author": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-06-16T21:15:03"}, "pmc-tag": "Bachelor in Paradise,Corinne Olympios,DeMario Jackson", "title": "\u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Contestant DeMario Jackson\u2019s Lawyer Speaks Out (EXCLUSIVE)", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Contestant DeMario Jackson\u2019s Lawyer Speaks Out (EXCLUSIVE)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bachelor-in-paradise-demario-jackson-lawyer-interview-1202469321/", "description": "\u201cBachelor In Paradise\u201d contestant DeMario Jackson has been thrust into the spotlight ever since production was shut down on ABC\u2019s dating series, due to allegations of \u201cmisco\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/demario-jackson-bachelor-in-paradise.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "DeMario Jackson Bachelor In Paradise"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-17T04:15:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-17T04:15:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@EWagmeister", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "\u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Contestant DeMario Jackson\u2019s Lawyer Speaks Out (EXCLUSIVE)"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/demario-jackson-bachelor-in-paradise.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "DeMario Jackson Bachelor In Paradise"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Contestant DeMario Jackson\u2019s Lawyer Speaks Out (EXCLUSIVE)", "description": "Exclusive interview with DeMario Jackson's attorney Walter Mosley about \"Bachelor In Paradise\" scandal."}, "author": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202469321, "title": "'Bachelor In Paradise' Contestant DeMario Jackson's Lawyer Speaks Out (EXCLUSIVE)", "published_at": "2017-06-16 21:15:03", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/demario-jackson-bachelor-in-paradise.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 15, "tags": "DeMario Jackson", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "\"Bachelor In Paradise\" contestant DeMario Jackson has been thrust into the spotlight ever since production was shut down on ABC's dating series, due to allegations of \"misconduct\" that launched an ongoing investigation by Warner Bros.
