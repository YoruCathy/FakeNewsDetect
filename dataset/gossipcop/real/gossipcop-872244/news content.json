She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let\u2019s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?\n\nRachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn\u2019t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn\u2019t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.\n\n\u201cI wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing \u2026 So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.\u201d\n\nAnd, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. \u201cFor me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cAnd I really haven\u2019t talked to him because I don\u2019t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he\u2019s doing well too.\u201d\n\nPeter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel\u2019s dog, which is very important.)\n\nThe number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, \u201cWe haven\u2019t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that\u2019s the plan. 2018, it\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d He explained that even though Rachel \u201cisn\u2019t much of a planner,\u201d the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. \u201cWe would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cI think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.\u201d\n\nI would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair\u2019s impending nuptials. \u201cGood music. I\u2019m very big on \u2018I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.\u2019 I know it\u2019s like our day, but it\u2019s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that\u2019s a must-have. No roses. We\u2019re done. Those days are over.\u201d\n\nNo roses is probably a good idea \u2014 she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel\u2019s finale, there\u2019s no doubt \u2014 she and Bryan are still in love, and they don\u2019t care who knows it.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/27/ef9e4ef0-cdde-4989-bae9-abc46d901172-getty-915942082.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/27/ef9e4ef0-cdde-4989-bae9-abc46d901172-getty-915942082.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/14/3320ea12-f35a-4f09-a1e8-3f26a77ed39a-getty-1206496569.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/3/20/c328eadf-9ae0-4257-99eb-e601f708c458-getty-916296824.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/9/dbe575a0-757f-431a-b1ff-26cca1927f4d-getty-1187976985.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/15/8feb9158-e1b8-420e-952c-a847f4994e90-getty-1187049088.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/27/ef9e4ef0-cdde-4989-bae9-abc46d901172-getty-915942082.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/are-rachel-bryan-still-together-in-2018-the-bachelorette-pair-started-their-relationship-amongst-a-lot-of-drama-9201095", "title": "Are Rachel & Bryan Still Together In 2018?
