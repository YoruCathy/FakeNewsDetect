Thursday, December 14, 2017, shall henceforth be known as the day that Will Smith, famous actor, father of Jaden and Willow, husband of Jada, finally made an Instagram. And he's a natural, as it turns out. Since posting the inaugural photo (a duck-face selfie, naturally) a day ago, the actor has amassed more than a million followers, gotten verified, and posted seven photos. In terms of social media savvy, Will Smith is a veritable Selena Gomez.\n\nBut along the way, Smith got some advice from a couple of famous friends. The first, Ellen DeGeneres, queen of the celebrity selfie, gave Smith a comprehensive Instagram tutorial during her show on Thursday. After the actor announced he's \"finally going on Instagram,\" DeGeneres helped him take a series of trendy portraits for the 'gram. They ran through duck-lips, a mirror selfie, a photo with a baby as a prop, a photo with vegetables as a prop, and a #TBT, all of which has since been uploaded onto Smith's Instagram. The most popular is, of course, the #TBT, a photo of Smith and DeGeneres recreating a still from the Fresh Prince of Bel-air opening credits that's gotten more than 366,000 likes.\n\nShortly after, Justin Timberlake became the first famous person to welcome Smith to Instagram. He posted a #TBT as well, along with some dad-friendly instructions.\n\n\"Welcome to Instagram @willsmith,\" he wrote in the caption. \"This is called a #TBT. Which means Throwback Thursday. Which is a photo you post on Thursdays that you like, that was taken in the past. I like this photo because it\u2019s a photo of you and me. And we look like we are having a serious conversation about something very important. And that makes me feel important.\"\n\nSmith, however, is doing just fine on his own. He has posted his own #TBT, a vintage photo of the actor as a young baby. \"Ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t got no filters like this,\" he wrote in the caption. All hail the Fresh Prince of Instagram.", "images": ["https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?crop=0px,100px,2500px,1250px&w=790px", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=3223313014351882&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a17ea0a86c03b8be7e_1995.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2ab04027c40d5040fb2_2015.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2af7ea0a86c03b8be8a_2017.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a27ea0a86c03b8be80_1999.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2aa4e24360ddd552de5_2014.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2ac4e24360ddd552de7_2016.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a17ea0a86c03b8be7c_016.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a704027c40d5040fb0_2010.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a404027c40d5040faa_2005.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a404027c40d5040fab_1996.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a87ea0a86c03b8be84_2012.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2ac04027c40d5040fb4_2016.jpg?h=600px", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a604027c40d5040fae_2007.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a67ea0a86c03b8be82_2009.jpg?h=600px", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/30/597dc2a74e24360ddd552de3_2011.jpg?h=600px"], "top_img": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?crop=0px,100px,2500px,1250px&w=790px", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/will-smith-instagram-justin-timberlake/", "title": "Will Smith Is Welcomed to Instagram by Justin Timberlake", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Will Smith made an Instagram account with the help of Ellen DeGeneres, and got a helpful tutorial on what a \"#TBT\" is from Justin Timberlake.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will Smith Is Welcomed to Instagram by Justin Timberlake", "description": "Will Smith made an Instagram account with the help of Ellen DeGeneres, and got a helpful tutorial on what a \"#TBT\" is from Justin Timberlake.", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/will-smith-instagram-justin-timberlake/", "site_name": "W Magazine | Women's Fashion & Celebrity News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?crop=0px,100px,2500px,1250px&w=790px", "secure_url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?crop=0px,100px,2500px,1250px&w=790px", "width": 2500, "height": 2103}}, "fb": {"app_id": 450372832509980}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Will Smith made an Instagram account with the help of Ellen DeGeneres, and got a helpful tutorial on what a \"#TBT\" is from Justin Timberlake.", "title": "Will Smith Is Welcomed to Instagram by Justin Timberlake", "image": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?crop=0px,100px,2500px,1250px&w=790px&mbid=social_retweet"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/txw965bK_lQ"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
