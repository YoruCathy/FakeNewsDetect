See for yourself below.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nSo who's the lucky guy? Balfe told People she's engaged to her boyfriend of almost two years, Tony McGill. The couple have kept their relationship fairly very private. As in, so private that there's virtually zero evidence of McGill on the internet. Here's the little of what we know about Balfe's fianc\u00e9 and their relationship over the past two years.\n\nThey got engaged over the holidays.\n\n\"It happened over the break,\" Balfe revealed. \"I\u2019m very happy.\"\n\n\n\nLike Balfe, he's Irish.\n\nDid \"McGill\" give it away?\n\nThere's a throwback video of the pair from 2015, and he looks *so* in love with her.\n\nThey've only been spotted in public together twice.\n\nFirst at the 2016 ceremony for Jodie Foster\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and almost a year ago at the 2017 Oscar Wilde Awards.\n\nBalfe and McGill attend the 2017 Oscar Wilde Awards in Los Angeles. Getty Images\n\nAnd although McGill seems like more of a mystery man than ever at this point, we can only hope the pair will be more open about their relationship now that Balfe has *officially* announced the engagement.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/mac.h-cdn.co/assets/17/31/1600x800/landscape-1502029616-ols3-304-110216-8298-a-6x4.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shutterstock-editorial-8433655r-huge-1024-1515430003.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.353xh;0,0.0541xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shutterstock-editorial-8433655r-huge-1024-1515430003.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.353xh;0,0.0541xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Epstein", "Associate Digital Editor", "Rachel Epstein Is The Associate Editor At Marieclaire.Com", "Where She Covers Celeb", "Royals News", "Culture", "Lifestyle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a14780956/who-is-caitriona-balfe-fiance-tony-mcgill/", "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Caitriona Balfe's Fianc\u00e9 Tony McGill", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Marie Claire", "title": "Everything You Need to Know About Caitriona Balfe's Fianc\u00e9 Tony McGill", "description": "Their relationship is *extremely* low-key.
