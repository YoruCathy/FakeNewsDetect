The garden theme is a perennial one for spring and summer collections, and this season has been no exception with impressive installations of flowers and shrubbery flanking runways all over town and floral motifs sprouting like weeds.\n\nFashion farmer Siriano managed to harvest his garden twice this season. The first time was by incorporating some of the literal references \u2014 think grass-green suiting, sunflower-yellow dresses and a parade of psychedelic floral brocades. The second time was by tying into the idea of inclusivity, specifically the slogan, \u201cWe all grow in the same garden,\u201d which appeared on a cropped black hoodie worn by a model named Joel, who may have identified as male. Or female. Or neither.\n\nJoining Joel on the runway were models that reflected real-life shapes, sizes and skin tones: curvy women, statuesque women, women of color.\n\nLeslie Jones, Gina Gershon, Patricia Clarkson, Vanessa Williams and Jillian Hervey in the front row of Christian Siriano\u2019s spring 2018 runway show in New York on Sept. 9.

After dressing actor Leslie Jones for the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d premiere in 2016 (the comedian had lamented on social media that no designer wanted to dress her), it became his calling card. And when he presented his fall and winter collection here in February, its standout \u201cpeople are people\u201d slogan tee and the fact that it was modeled by women of various sizes earned him a standing ovation.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise that Jones turned out for Siriano\u2019s show, sitting elbow to elbow with celebrities such as Patricia Clarkson, Gina Gershon and Vanessa Williams. What was a surprise \u2014 and made the show thoroughly entertaining \u2014 was Jones\u2019 responses to the various looks that came down the catwalk and her enthusiastic interaction with the models.\n\nLooks from the Christian Siriano spring 2018 runway collection.

At one point, her enthusiastic faux-coaching of supermodel Coco Rocha earned an extremely rare (but so well-deserved) breaking of the fourth wall between audience and model, with Rocha acknowledging her cheering section of one by lingering briefly in Jones\u2019 vicinity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForget the silver bells and cockle shells \u2014 to be honest, we\u2019re not exactly sure what a cockle shell is \u2014 we suspect Siriano\u2019s continued emphasis on diversity on the runway and inclusivity in creating clothes wearable by a wider range of customers will grow his garden significantly going forward.\n\nAs the runway filled for the finale walk \u2014 to the tune of Blur\u2019s \u201cGirls And Boys\u201d \u2014 there they were: pretty maids all in a row.\n\nadam.tschorn@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more musings on all things fashion and style, follow me at @ARTschorn.\n\nALSO:\n\nViva Avant Garde!
