Twenty-somethings from across the country hopped on Greyhounds and traveled to Catskills for Woodstock in the summer of \u201969, while Deadheads roamed across the country well into the \u201980s. With the \u201990s came a surge in well-organized, blockbuster music festivals outside of major cities in the US, which were embraced by yuppies, grunge kids, and new hippies alike.\n\nToday, music festivals are more common than ever. Coachella in California starts this weekend, and there are dozens of festivals scheduled this summer across the country. A while back, we told you about Bonnaroo, Hangout, and the Electric Daisy festival, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. From Lollapolooza to Governor\u2019s Ball to Outside Lands and more, the options (and locations) are plentiful.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about shelling out the cash for one of these, think of it like this \u2014 you\u2019re never going to be younger, have more energy, or have fewer responsibilities than you do RIGHT NOW.\n\nThese tickets are not cheap, but \u2014 to me \u2014 they are totally worth forgoing a few weekends out, skipping some trips to the mall, or picking up a couple of extra shifts at work. An outdoor music festival is something that you will remember and tell stories about for the rest of your life. And let\u2019s face it \u2014 once you have a full time job, a pet, and a family of your own, you can\u2019t exactly skip town and go on a three-day camp out as easily as you could before.\n\nEmbrace your youth and seize your summer. Do something awesome and memorable now while you still have the chance!\n\nHaving more than a few music festivals under my belt at this point, I\u2019ve done tons and tons of research on how to stay safe and comfortable, while having as much fun as you possibly can at these events. I\u2019ve compiled it all, and am thrilled to get to share with you some of the best tips and suggestions for enjoying an outdoor music festival.\n\nAt the end of this post, be sure to comment \u2014 especially if you have experience with these sort of concerts \u2014 and give some good advice to your fellow CF gals. We\u2019re a community here, so don\u2019t hold back if you have an awesome story or some good advice to share!\n\n7 Packing Tips and Considerations for Outdoor Music Festivals\n\n1. Be prepared for all kinds of weather.\n\nI know this probably a no-brainer, but I can\u2019t think of an easier way to ruin your trip than to not have the right clothes with you. I know you smart girls will obviously check the weather forecast, but be sure to bring a pair of leggings, a hoodie, shoes that won\u2019t get ruined in the rain, and an anorak. That way, you\u2019ll be covered for any sort of surprises.\n\nAlso, sunscreen is completely non-negotiable. Oftentimes, the days with the most perfect, breezy weather lead to the worse sunburns because you don\u2019t feel the sun roasting your skin. A swimsuit, flip flops, and a wide-brimmed hat seem like good ideas, too!\n\n2. Have a plan for looking fabulous.\n\nSure, I understand that at these festivals, you spend all day (and possibly all night) outside. That said, ignoring my hygiene and appearance for four whole days is more than I can handle. Here are the best tips that I rounded up for staying fresh at festivals:\n\nBring cash for showers . A lot of campsites have locker room-style showers you can use for $5-$10 a pop. I don\u2019t know about you, but to me this seems totally worth the cash. You might want to wear a pair of flip flops and your swimsuit while you shower too, just in case! Budget for this as part of your financial plan for your trip.\n\n.

You might want to wear a pair of flip flops and your swimsuit while you shower too, just in case! Budget for this as part of your financial plan for your trip. Pick up some bio-degradable shampoo . I\u2019ve heard that at some nature-centric shows (like Bonnaroo, for instance) you\u2019re allowed to wash up in swimming streams as long as your products aren\u2019t toxic to the environment. Sure it\u2019s not ideal, but it seems like it could be an awesome way to freshen up greasy, sweaty hair in a pinch. Add some leave-in conditioner or scrunch your hair with salt spray, and you\u2019ll be ready to go!\n\n.

They\u2019re the perfect way to swipe the grime away from your neck, underarms, forehead, feet, and more. Bring a full pack to leave at your campsite, then pack a few singles in plastic baggies to bring with you during the day.\n\nwill be your new best friends.

Bring a full pack to leave at your campsite, then pack a few singles in plastic baggies to bring with you during the day. This sounds pretty crazy, but seems like it\u2019s worth a try. If you want to wash your face, but don\u2019t have access to a sink, pour water into an upside down Frisbee and use it to rinse. Genius! Also, I\u2019m sure that you could probably get away with brushing your teeth using a water bottle to rinse as well.\n\nbut don\u2019t have access to a sink, pour water into an upside down Frisbee and use it to rinse. Genius! Also, I\u2019m sure that you could probably get away with brushing your teeth using a water bottle to rinse as well. Remember your old standbys from home, dry shampoo and makeup primer . Dry shampoo will make even the dirtiest hair last another day or two (see our post on the best dry shampoos), while a good makeup primer will keep any makeup you have on from melting all over your face. I know some gals love to go makeup free, but I\u2019m just not one of them!\n\n.

Again, do not forget sunscreen! This will probably be the most important thing you pack all weekend.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve done plenty of research, I\u2019m not an expert on this subject, even after a few festivals.

Pack smart.\n\nNow isn\u2019t the time to bring that Louis Vuitton Neverfull tote you got for graduation \u2014 fancy or designer items will make you and your campsite a target for theft. Other things to keep in mind:\n\nOnly bring clothes that you wouldn\u2019t be devastated if you lost or accidentally ruined.\n\nBe sure to think about comfort first . I know that you want to wear that adorable crocheted halter top you just bought, but would you really want to spend all day tugging at your uncomfortable strapless bra?\n\n. I know that you want to wear that adorable crocheted halter top you just bought, but would you really want to spend all day tugging at your uncomfortable strapless bra? Double check that your shoes won\u2019t give you blisters, your shorts don\u2019t chafe your legs, and the tops your wear don\u2019t require constant adjustment.\n\nIt would probably be a smart idea to have bandages, feminine products, aspirin, granola bars, Gatorade, and a couple extra water bottles tucked in your bags as well.\n\nSee our list of music festival essentials for a few more must-have items, plus in-depth explanations for why you need them.\n\n4. Have your essentials with you at all times.\n\nCarry a small backpack, a cross-body purse, or even a fanny pack with you during the day and use it to store your cell phone, camera, cash, ID, keys, and anything else that\u2019s crucial with you. (Here\u2019s our guide to exactly what to pack in your bag for a music festival.)\n\nYour regular purse won\u2019t work \u2014 you\u2019ll want to have your hands free, and not risk accidentally setting your bag somewhere and forgetting about it. I hear that these concerts are generally very peaceful and safe \u2014 most people are just there to listen to music and have a great time. But, at the same time, it\u2019s important to be prepared and cognizant of the people around you. Speaking of which\u2026\n\n5. Safety first!\n\nAny event that draws thousands of people will attract a handful of shady characters, but you\u2019re at an even higher risk considering that many of these shows are overnight events, and, well, many people you encounter will be using alcohol or drugs. It\u2019s super-important that you use the buddy system and stay very aware of your surroundings. Here are a few general rules to follow:\n\nConcert festivals are a great place to meet people, but don\u2019t go back to another person\u2019s campsite without one of your friends.\n\nBe careful about wandering too far away from main areas, and schedule specific meeting times for your group in case your cell phone dies.\n\nfor your group in case your cell phone dies. Don\u2019t carry too much cash with you, and be sure not to flash it around at vendors.\n\nDon\u2019t accept food or drinks from people you don\u2019t know. If you start to feel weird or sick, tell a friend or security guard immediately and have them take you to the first aid tent.\n\nRemember that it\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry!\n\n6. Beware of wearing the wrong things\u2026.\n\nAs much as I love rompers and leotards, they are not always the best choices for music festivals. Both will be problematic if you have to use the restroom during the day. Since most festivals only have outdoor Port-A-Pottys, removing your entire outfit to pee is not something you\u2019ll want to do!\n\nDresses are also something you may want to stay away from if you are planning on trying to crowd surf at your festival, as you do not want to give the audience a show of your own. If you do wear a dress and want to crowd surf, wear bike shorts underneath. (One of our music festival outfits below includes a dress, so this isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule, just something to keep in mind.)\n\nFinally, go easy on the perfume in the morning, as the heat may exacerbate the aroma and you do not want to give yourself or those around you a headache.\n\n7. Embrace the experience.\n\nYou\u2019ll never be able to duplicate an experience like an outdoor concert festival. Be sure to explore all aspects and really soak up the whole event. Meet new people. Join a yoga session or Frisbee game. Participate in an interactive art expo, learn to play hacky sack, or enjoy a hippie drum circle. We\u2019re young and fun, and need to do these cool things while we still can. Don\u2019t worry about how you look or what people will think. Just squeeze the juice out of your weekend and make this experience the best it can be.\n\nMusic Festival Outfits Ideas\n\nOf course, your ideal music festival outfits will depend on the temperature, location, and even the genre of music found at the event. Consider these looks as a good starting place to get you inspired!\n\nMusic Festival Outfit 1:\n\nProducts: Shorts \u2013 Lucky Brand, Tee \u2013 Nasty Gal, Flannel \u2013 LL Bean, Sunglasses \u2013 Nordstrom, Shoes \u2013 Amazon, Bracelets \u2013 Macy\u2019s, Lipstick \u2013 Kylie Cosmetics\n\nThis music festival outfit will keep you cool and looking cute all day \u2014 and all night \u2014 long! I love the look of a cropped tee shirt with denim cutoffs \u2014 a total music festival fashion must-have. (Seriously, just count the number of pairs of cutoffs you see when you\u2019re at the festival \u2014 they\u2019re everywhere!) Tie a flannel around your waist for a cute look during the day, then untie the flannel and wear it over top when it gets chilly at night.\n\nCanvas sneakers are comfy and practical, while a stack of bracelets (to wear alongside your festival wristbands) adds some extra flair. Throw on some lipstick and shades and you\u2019re ready to go!\n\nMusic Festival Outfit 2:\n\nProducts: Dress \u2013 Revolve, Hat \u2013 Urban Outfitters, Boots \u2013 Nordstrom, Sunglasses \u2013 Madewell, Necklace \u2013 Nordstrom\n\nThis ensemble would look particularly amazing at a festival like Coachella where boho style is the aesthetic of choice. A simple, breezy dress makes a great base, while tough combat boots and a quirky hat will give you a cool-girl vibe. Finish with sunglasses and a long, bohemian necklace.\n\nMusic Festival Outfit 3:\n\nProducts: Kimono \u2013 Lulu\u2019s, Boots \u2013 Amazon, Crop Top \u2013 Lulu\u2019s, Bag \u2013 Amazon, Earrings \u2013 Nordstrom, Jeans \u2013 Topshop\n\nThis look reminds me of something a celebrity would wear to Coachella! A trendy kimono-style cardigan like this is stylish, comfortable, and perfect for a concert setting. Paired with ripped jeans and a crop top, it\u2019s a perfect outfit no-brainer.\n\nFringed boots with a low heel look cute, but won\u2019t kill your feet. Statement earrings draw out one of the colors in the kimono while adding a quirky vibe to the look. Finish with a cross-body bag.\n\nStories or Tips?
