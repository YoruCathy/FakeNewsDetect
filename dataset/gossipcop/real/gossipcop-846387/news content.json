It's about changing. It's about transitioning. I can't imagine, as a human being, not being able to grow.\"\n\nDo-Gooder Gallery\n\nThe 71-year-old explained hitting a milestone birthday made her look at her life differently.\n\n\"When I turned 50, I asked some of my girlfriends, all actresses of the same age, 'What are we going to do now?' I wanted to go live somewhere for a while, learn archaeology, or take part in healing the world on some level. I wanted to dig deep and say, 'Who am I now? What do I have to offer? What do I have to learn?'\"\n\nHawn also said that after 9/11 she realized what she wanted to do something more meaningful.\n\n\"I ended up writing two books and creating MindUP. It's now in Jordan, Serbia, the U.K., America, Canada, Hong Kong. I never looked back. I never wished to be acting again. I was so engaged,\" she said.\n\nBut that desire to stay away from the screen clearly faded.\n\nAfter a decade and a half away, the funny lady is back in full effect, starring alongside Amy Schumer in \"Snatched,\" due out in theaters on May 11.", "images": ["https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/goldieamy.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/San_Diego_On_Light@3x-1.png?fit=381%2C120", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/San_Diego_On_Dark@3x-2.png?fit=381%2C120", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/goodnews2-apr17.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/GettyImages-1219262470.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1024px%2C576px&resize=850%2C478"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/goldieamy.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meg Swertlow"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/846387/kate-hudson-gets-mom-goldie-hawn-to-spill-the-details-on-why-she-took-a-15-year-break-from-hollywood", "title": "Goldie Hawn Spills Details On15-Year Break From Hollywood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 7 San Diego", "type": "article", "description": "Why did the comedy icon take a decade and half off from film?", "title": "Goldie Hawn Spills Details On15-Year Break From Hollywood", "url": "https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/hawn-spills-details-on-15-year-break-from-hollywood/2023081/", "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/goldieamy.jpg?resize=850%2C478"}, "google-site-verification": "IEReflDAGG9alRk9BZvi1yyXoUkp8VVr2tQDgwleG2k", "fb": {"app_id": 96971132149}, "twitter": {"site": "@nbcsandiego", "creator": "@nbcsandiego", "description": "Why did the comedy icon take a decade and half off from film?", "title": "Goldie Hawn Spills Details On15-Year Break From Hollywood", "url": "https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/hawn-spills-details-on-15-year-break-from-hollywood/2023081/", "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/goldieamy.jpg?resize=850%2C478"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCSanDiego"}, "description": "Why did the comedy icon take a decade and half off from film?", "keywords": "America, Amy Schumer, Canada, GOLDIE HAWN, Jordan, Kate Hudson, Meg Swertlow, Serbia, Snatched, United Kingdom", "sailthru.title": "Goldie Hawn Spills Details On15-Year Break From Hollywood", "sailthru.description": "Why did the comedy icon take a decade and half off from film?", "sailthru.tags": "America, Amy Schumer, Canada, GOLDIE HAWN, Jordan, Kate Hudson, Meg Swertlow, Serbia, Snatched, United Kingdom", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-26T16:15:07+00:00", "taboola_lead": "video", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/cropped-NBC_San-Diego.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493223307.0, "source": "https://www.nbcsandiego.com", "summary": ""}
