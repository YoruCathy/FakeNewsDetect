Damon's father died on Dec. 14 from complications involving multiple myeloma.\n\n\"He's all you could ever ask for in a son,\" Kent said of Matt in 2011. \"It's been a wonderful ride being his dad.\" E. Charbonneau / WireImage\n\nThe \"Downsizing\" star had been lying low lately in favor of spending time with his father. Damon also told \"Extra\" on Dec. 11 that his family was looking for prayers.\n\n\"It's been a slow unfolding; my dad's sick, so that's a process we're going through,\" he said. \"We'll take any prayers you got, so throw 'em up there.\"\n\nThe senior Damon\u2019s diagnosis with multiple myeloma, a rare and incurable blood cancer that weakens the body\u2019s ability to fight infection, was first revealed in 2011. At the time, Matt Damon told WCVB that Kent would \u201cfight (the disease) to a standstill.\u201d\n\nMatt Damon and his father, Kent, attend the premiere of \"The Town\" in 2010 at Boston's Fenway Park. Shutterstock\n\nThat was enough to keep Damon's father going for the last few years, no doubt in part because of the bond he had with his son. \"He's all you could ever ask for in a son,\" the elder Damon said to WCVB. \"It's been a wonderful ride being his dad.\"\n\nWe\u2019re sorry to hear Kent\u2019s battle has come to an end. We wish the Damon family all the best during this difficult time.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/2015-05-07T22-49-22-9Z--1280x720.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_51/1306416/matt-damon-kent-today-171223-tease-01_6e22aa40ac481765061ecdbdc6906483.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_51/1306416/matt-damon-kent-today-171223-tease-01_6e22aa40ac481765061ecdbdc6906483.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/matt-damon-s-father-kent-dies-74-t120464", "title": "Matt Damon's father, Kent, dies at 74", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/matt-damon-s-father-kent-dies-74-t120464", "title": "Matt Damon's father, Kent, dies at 74", "description": "The actor's father passed away Dec. 14 after losing his battle with multiple myeloma - a rare blood cancer - his representative confirmed on Saturday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_51/1306416/matt-damon-kent-today-171223-tease-01_6e22aa40ac481765061ecdbdc6906483.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_51/1306416/matt-damon-kent-today-171223-tease-01_6e22aa40ac481765061ecdbdc6906483.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_51/1306416/matt-damon-kent-today-171223-tease-01_6e22aa40ac481765061ecdbdc6906483.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Matt Damon's father, Kent, dies at 74", "description": "The actor's father passed away Dec. 14 after losing his battle with multiple myeloma - a rare blood cancer - his representative confirmed on Saturday.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The actor's father passed away Dec. 14 after losing his battle with multiple myeloma - a rare blood cancer - his representative confirmed on Saturday.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_51/1306416/matt-damon-kent-today-171223-tease-01_6e22aa40ac481765061ecdbdc6906483.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514082120.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
