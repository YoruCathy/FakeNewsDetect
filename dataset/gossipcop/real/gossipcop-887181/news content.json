She added the caption: \u201cShame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him.\u201d\n\nAsia Argento (@AsiaArgento) Shame on this pig and everyone who grunted with him #amfARLosAngeles https://t.co/0SujRNCzd9\n\nCorden has since apologised for causing offence, and says his jokes were intended to shame Weinstein, not his victims.\n\nIn a statement released on Twitter, the British star said: \u201cTo be clear, sexual assault is no laughing matter. I was not trying to make light of Harvey\u2019s inexcusable behavior, but to shame him, the abuser, not his victims. I am truly sorry for anyone offended, that was never my intention.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn footage of the event, loud groans can be heard after Corden told his audience it was a beautiful night in LA \u2013 \u201cso beautiful, Harvey Weinstein has already asked tonight up to his hotel to give him a massage\u201d.\n\nCorden said: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that groan was that you liked that joke or you don\u2019t like that joke. If you don\u2019t like that joke you should probably leave now.\u201d\n\nEmboldened, he continued: \u201cIt has been weird this week hasn\u2019t it, watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water. Ask any of the women who watched him take a bath \u2026 it\u2019s weird watching Harvey Weinstein in hot water.\n\n\u201cHarvey Weinstein wanted to come tonight but he\u2019ll settle for whatever potted plant is closest.\u201d\n\nThat joke prompted more groans. \u201cOh come on!\u201d said Corden.\n\nMcGowan also said that CBS, who broadcast Corden\u2019s Late Late Show should donate to a women\u2019s charity, or they too \u201csupport rape culture\u201d.\n\nCorden, the host of The Late Late Show, was master of ceremonies at the gala for amfAR, a foundation for Aids research, on Friday evening. The footage of his jokes was posted on Twitter by a Hollywood Reporter journalist, Chris Gardner.\n\nChris Gardner (@chrissgardner) Straight out gate, host @JKCorden with Harvey Weinstein jokes. Too soon? Some laughs, some groans #amfARLosAngeles pic.twitter.com/nx88w5UwUe\n\nJulia Roberts was given a special award for courage during the event while the guests included Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn, Melanie Griffith, Sean Penn and Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin as a surprise guest performer.\n\nFor many on Twitter, Corden\u2019s jokes were far too soon. \u201cJames Corden\u2019s \u2018jokes\u2019 about the Weinstein situation are disgusting. Sexual harassment is never funny. Ever,\u201d wrote one user.\n\n\u201cJames Corden just embarrassed every #Brit in #LA. Whack jokes about #Weinstein & #sexualassault are no joke,\u201d wrote another.\n\nHarvey Weinstein: Scotland Yard investigates further sexual assault claims Read more\n\nWeinstein was executive producer of the 2013 film One Chance, a biopic in which Corden played the Britain\u2019s Got Talent winner Paul Potts. It was Corden who suggested Take That\u2019s Gary Barlow to Weinstein when he needed to change the music on his stage musical project Finding Neverland.\n\nThe condemnation of Corden for making jokes followed the condemnation of Saturday Night Live over a week ago for not making jokes and for ignoring the story altogether. But on Saturday Weinstein did feature. The show included a sketch featuring a \u201cwomen\u2019s roundtable\u201d of actors at a film festival. On the subject of whisper networks, one said: \u201cWe had a secret code among us actresses to warn each other about creeps. The code was: \u2018He raped me.\u2019 And if the men were listening, they tuned us right out.\u201d\n\nIn the regular \u201cweekend update\u201d section, the comedian Michael Che said: \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to make jokes about a guy who looks like this,\u201d pointing to a photo. \u201cHe looks like chewed bubble gum rolled in cat hair.\u201d\n\nWeinstein said he has made a mistake, Che continued, but Weinstein\u2019s actions were not a mistake. \u201cYou assaulted dozens of women. That\u2019s not a mistake, that\u2019s a full season of Law & Order.\u201d\n\n", "images":
