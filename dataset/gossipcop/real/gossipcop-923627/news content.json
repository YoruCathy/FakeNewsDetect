Davidson, who lost his life.\n\n\u201cOur production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,\u201d read the statement. \u201cAs soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
