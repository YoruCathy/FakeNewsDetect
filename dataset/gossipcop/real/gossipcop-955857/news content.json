Find out everything we know about Stranger Things 3 below.\n\nWhen is Stranger Things 3 released on Netflix?\n\nNetflix confirmed at the start of 2019 that the new third season would be released on 4th July 2019 \u2013 Independence Day in the USA.\n\nDavid Harbour (Chief Jim Hopper) had already indicated that season three probably wouldn\u2019t arrive until 2019. Netflix\u2019s vice president of original programming Cindy Holland then confirmed that season three would not be released until summer 2019, saying however that the delay will be \u201cworth the wait\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Creators] The Duffer Brothers and [producer] Shawn Levy, they understand the stakes are high,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to deliver something bigger and better than last year. I think it\u2019s going to be a fantastic season. It will be worth the wait.\u201d\n\nOn 10 November 2018, David Harbour confirmed that he had finished filming \u2013 and that he was looking forward to shaving off his moustache.\n\nThe summer 2019 release ties in with the show\u2019s initial \u2018mall teaser\u2019, which first hinted at a summer release.\n\nIn September 2018, executive producer and director Shawn Levy said during the Emmys that \u201ccinematically, it\u2019s our biggest season yet\u201d, which perhaps goes some way to explain the additional time required to film season three.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nYES. Netflix unveiled the first full trailer for Stranger Things\u2019 summery season three on 20th March. Set to The Who\u2019s Baba O\u2019Reilly, it\u2019s clear the Stranger Things kids are starting to grow up \u2013 but the terrors of the Upside Down haven\u2019t gone away\u2026\n\nA couple of months later, Netflix released another full-length trailer that revealed the return of season two\u2019s monstrous Mind Flayer, who now appears to be possessing Dacre Montgomery\u2019s character Billy.\n\nCheck out our full breakdown of the trailer here.\n\nNetflix had previously released a short teaser in the form of an ad for a new mall in Hawkins, which features ice cream vendors Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) and newcomer Robin (Maya Thurman-Hawke). Watch it below.\n\nAnd on 20th May, we got our first look at a full scene from the series, in a promo entitled \u201cSummer in Hawkins\u201d. It sees Billy \u2013 now a lifeguard at the local pool \u2013 and Mrs Wheeler having a flirt. Check it out below.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nThe good news is that all of the original cast are on board for the new episodes. That means: Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s Eleven, Finn Wolfhard\u2019s Mike, Winona Ryder\u2019s Joyce, Noah Schnapp\u2019s Will, Caleb Mclaughlin\u2019s Lucas, Gaten Matarazzo\u2019s Dustin, Natalia Dyer\u2019s Nancy, Charlie Heaton\u2019s Jonathan and fan favourite Joe Keery (Steve) are all set to return.\n\nPromo posters for Stranger Things season 3! pic.twitter.com/m6fgSPPevN \u2014 Stranger Things Posts (@ST_Posts) May 20, 2019\n\nSeason two additions Max (Sadie Sink) and Billy (Dacre Montgomery) will return, but sadly Sean Astin\u2019s Bob\u2026 We\u2019re still not ready to talk about it.\n\nAs for new additions: fresh off last year\u2019s BBC adaptation of Little Women, Maya Thurman-Hawke (daughter of Uma and Ethan) will join up with the main cast as Robin, a new character who uncovers a \u201cdark secret\u201d in Hawkins.\n\nConsidering Thurman-Hawke\u2019s age (she\u2019s 19), we\u2019re guessing that she\u2019ll be part of the older kids\u2019 peer group alongside characters like Jonathan and Nancy \u2013 but what could this \u201cdark secret\u201d be? Is it just that she uncovers the events of the first two Stranger Things seasons, or something new? And could her character end up being a new love interest for jilted Steve?\n\nStorm Troopers star Jake Busey and Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) have also been added to the line-up as new characters Bruce and Mayor Kline, respectively, and Haters Back Off\u2019s Francesca Reale will feature as Heather, a lifeguard at the community pool who becomes the focal point of a \u201cdark mystery\u201d.\n\nPlus, Lucas\u2019 sarky little sister Erica (played by Priah Ferguson) is set to play a much bigger role. According to a release from Netflix, season three will see her embark on a \u201cwild mission to save Hawkins from a dangerous and unexpected new threat\u201d.\n\nCheck out a beautiful poster for the new season below\n\none question: does the Starcourt Mall have a Nando's? pic.twitter.com/FNOMKWub9D \u2014 Netflix UK & Ireland (@NetflixUK) June 4, 2019\n\nWhat happened in Stranger Things 1 & 2?\n\nNetflix got the cast together to explain what happened in the first two seasons \u2013 check the video out below.\n\nThe cast of #StrangerThings tells you everything you need to remember about @Stranger_Things Seasons 1 and 2 to prepare for Season 3! https://t.co/IOiPEkDssK pic.twitter.com/szdXraDW8w \u2014 See What's Next (@seewhatsnext) June 24, 2019\n\n*Spoilers for Stranger Things 2 to follow*\n\nNetflix released the official synopsis for Stranger Things 3 in June.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1985 in Hawkins, Indiana, and summer\u2019s heating up. School\u2019s out, there\u2019s a brand new mall in town, and the Hawkins crew are on the cusp of adulthood,\u201d it reads. \u201cRomance blossoms and complicates the group\u2019s dynamic, and they\u2019ll have to figure out how to grow up without growing apart. Meanwhile, danger looms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the town\u2019s threatened by enemies old and new, Eleven and her friends are reminded that evil never ends; it evolves. Now they\u2019ll have to band together to survive, and remember that friendship is always stronger than fear.\u201d\n\nYou can also check out the episode titles for the eight episodes of season three below.\n\nSuzie, Do You Copy?\n\nThe Mall Rats\n\nThe Case Of The Missing Lifeguard\n\nThe Sauna Test\n\nThe Source\n\nThe Birthday\n\nThe Bite\n\nThe Battle of Starcourt\n\nIn recent interviews, the cast has hinted that there\u2019s going to be more horror and gore than ever before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely gorier,\u201d Gaten Matarazzo said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like gore stuff, I mean, watch it anyway. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart, as some would say.\u201d\n\nNoah Schnapp also revealed that Will Byers is not quite over his stint in the Upside Down\u2026\n\n\u201cWill still has the presence of the monster left, and you kind of see what happens there,\u201d said actor Noah Schnapp. \u201cPeople have asked, \u2018Does Will get a break this season?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, sure, for the first two episodes. And then no one really gets a break.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeason two of Stranger Things tied up a LOT more loose ends than the first, with the portal to the Upside Down now sealed off, Hawkins lab apparently closed for good and Jonathan and Nancy finally getting together (poor Steve).\n\nHowever, the kids\u2019 Snow Ball idyll was marred by the final shot of the series, which saw the devilish Smoke Monster that had been terrorising our heroes (aka the Mind Flayer) land on the roof of the school in the parallel Upside Down dimension, ready to get revenge for his defeat in the season finale.\n\nWe do know that there\u2019s a new mall in Hawkins, which will likely become a hangout for the kids in season 3. Steve Harrington has gone and got himself a job in an ice cream parlour there, alongside new girl Robin \u2013 and you can cut the sexual tension between them with a knife in this teaser (ok, you can\u2019t \u2013 but we reckon there\u2019s a strong chance these two will be romantically entangled in the new season).\n\nA new behind-the-scenes book meanwhile, Worlds Turned Upside Down, confirms that the series will be set in 1985, less than a year after the events of season two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the final summer of their childhood,\u201d Ross Duffer says in the book. \u201cThey\u2019re dealing with growing up, with these complicated new relationships. They\u2019re starting to fall apart a little bit, and maybe they don\u2019t love playing Dungeons & Dragons as much as they used to. Naturally, that\u2019s going to generate conflict.\u201d\n\nExecutive Producer Shawn Levy told Glamour back in January that season three would \u201cdeal with forces of evil that are new\u201d, but an interview with the Duffer brothers suggests that the usual Upside Down monsters will likely still be in the picture.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve shut the door on the Mind Flayer, but not only is it still there in the Upside Down, it\u2019s very much aware of the kids, and particularly Eleven,\u201d Ross Duffer told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cIt had not encountered her and her powers until that final episode. Now, it knows that she\u2019s out there. We wanted to end on a little bit of an ominous note.\u201d\n\nIt also seems very likely that we haven\u2019t seen the last of Eleven\u2019s \u201csister\u201d Kali/Eight, with the superpowered illusionist escaping the police at the end of episode seven and apparently still keen on taking Eleven on a mission of vengeance against the men who wronged them.\n\nIn fact, given how abruptly her story ends, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Kali and her Warriors-esque gang turned up in Hawkins to cause trouble in the next season \u2013 and with her mindbending powers, we\u2019re betting she could cause a lot of damage. Plus \u2013 what of numbers 1-7, 9-10 and beyond?\n\nSeason three will be preceded by a new novel, Darkness on the Edge of Town, which will explore the backstory of Chief Jim Hopper as he served as a homicide detective in New York City in 1977.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Netflix, the book from author Adam Christopher will feature stories that Hopper tells Eleven.\n\n\u201cWhen Eleven gets curious about unanswered questions, Hopper is forced to reckon with some long-buried secrets,\u201d it read. This book \u2013 which is released on 4th June \u2013 could contain vital information for season three\u2026\n\nHere's some big @StrangerThings news. The REAL (official, canonical!) story of Jim Hopper is coming to a bookstore near you. When Eleven gets curious about unanswered questions, Hopper is forced to reckon with some long-buried secrets. And, you know me. I love secrets. pic.twitter.com/CSGdkCVyaj \u2014 NX (@NXOnNetflix) February 8, 2019\n\nAs for the action in season three itself, Hopper struggles with being a single parent of a telekinetic teenager, which sees him seek advice from Joyce (Winona Ryder).\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s able to offer me some advice on how to deal with being a single parent and how to, like, you know, stop being so damn controlling,\u201d actor David Harbour tells Entertainment Weekly.\n\nIt also seems that raising Eleven has brought on a new bad habit for Hopper: stress eating.\n\n\u201cThis season, Hopper does a lot of really big, like, action-y things. But he\u2019s fatter than you\u2019ve ever seen him and less capable of hurting people, but a little more capable because he\u2019s just like a big elephant,\u201d Harbour said\n\nAnd, last but not least, we\u2019ve been promised more \u201cdad Steve\u201d, and the continuation of his bromance with Dustin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely get to see some more of Steve Harrington in season three, and I\u2019ll just say we won\u2019t be abandoning the Dad Steve magic,\u201d Levy told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say much more, but I literally feel that we were walking along and we stumbled onto a gold mine with Dad Steve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely see more of that,\u201d added Gaven Matarazzo (Dustin) in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really like about Matt and Ross: They know what fans like and they roll with it.\u201d\n\nWhich films inspired Stranger Things 3?\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the Duffers detailed the films which they looked to for inspiration when creating the new season. They include:\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High\n\nThe Thing\n\nRomancing the Stone\n\nMidnight Run\n\nIndiana Jones\n\nJurassic Park\n\nThe films of David Cronenberg\n\nSounds like a crazy mix \u2013 we can\u2019t wait to see how this plays out on screen.\n\nIs there really going to be a Stranger Things video game?\n\nThere will indeed. To coincide with the series release, a suitably retro beat-em-up video game will also be unveiled on 4th July.\n\nThe game is set to be available on the Nintendo Switch, with other platforms still to be confirmed. Check out a clip of the in-game action below.\n\nExplore the world of the @netflix original series in the official game for Stranger Things 3!
