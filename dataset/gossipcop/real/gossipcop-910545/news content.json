This time, however, he really stepped in it\u2014by challenging Dame Helen Mirren, who delivered some of the harshest digs yet during their tussle on Tuesday\u2019s Late Late Show. Corden started off scorching, even delivering a dig at Mirren\u2019s former relationship with Liam Neeson: \u201cYou dated Liam Neeson back in 1982. He left you real quick; he wasn\u2019t \u2018taken\u2019 with you.\u201d But, alas, the host was no match for Mirren, who dropped a barrage of excellent bars atop his head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one you should fear, wherever I go,\u201d Mirren shot back. \u201cIf I\u2019m a pain in your ass, that leaves a lot of room to grow.\u201d\n\nSome other choice lines:\n\n\u201cYou stand out not for games or banter. Other shows do comedy; you just pander.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with my exes. Sorry, James, I\u2019m not single. But you know I taught your little mister to tingle.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor James Corden will never be satisfied\u2014until you find a way to get attention deep fried. This battle is fun. I\u2019m glad that you asked. It\u2019s the only bit you didn\u2019t find in Jimmy Fallon\u2019s trash.\u201d\n\nThe segment was totally in keeping with Mirren\u2019s Hollywood persona as fearless, irreverent royalty, and her skill was actually pretty impressive, even in a format that accomodates rap neophytes. The coup de gr\u00e2ce? \u201cYou fucked up, James. You desperate tater tot. A woman\u2019s worth isn\u2019t credits, or who says she\u2019s hot. Boys\u2019 club bullshit\u2014I\u2019m done with that crap.
