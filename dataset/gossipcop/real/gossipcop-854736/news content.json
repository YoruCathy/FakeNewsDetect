Is this the supermodel taking a page out of her sister Kim Kardashian\u2019s book?\n\nAirport attire?\n\nKendall Jenner, 21, wore matching nude-colored see-through leggings and a long-sleeve top in a crotchet-like pattern to the airport on Thursday, E! News reported.\n\nThe supermodel went sans bra to LAX, leaving her breasts exposed by the bright flashes of the paparazzi cameras. The pants revealed a nude-colored pair of briefs underneath and her long legs.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians model seems to have gotten her inspiration from her older sister, Kim Kardashian, who is often wearing revealing clothing and daring ensembles.\n\nKendall tucked her see-through pants into a pair of beige heeled Yeezy ankle boots, which Kim Kardashian has also been spotted doing recently. She also appeared to have gone without makeup for her travels.\n\nKendall was flying to Nice for the annual Cannes Film Festival, according to Daily Mail.\n\nThe model made her way to a car waiting upon her arrival before heading off to the luxury 5-star Eden Roc Hotel in Antibes.\n\nalways been an OG #TBT A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 18, 2017 at 9:20am PDT\n\nKendall Jenner teases her saucy lingerie as she lands in Nice for Cannes Film Festival appearance https://t.co/gF2R2SMPKV \u2014 Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) May 19, 2017\n\nShe carried a bright mustard-colored tote bag and covered her eyes with oversized black aviators.\n\nSo, Kendall Jenner wore see-through pants to the airport https://t.co/dIngwhOmCS pic.twitter.com/IlAl7QkiOz \u2014 Who What Wear (@WhoWhatWear) May 19, 2017\n\nStyle evolution.\n\nJenner\u2019s style has evolved over the years since gaining more experience in the fashion world.
