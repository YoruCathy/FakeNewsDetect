It was a simple yet perplexing scene, and it spawned memes and copycats across the Internet:\n\nIsaac finally broke down the story behind the viral photo Tuesday night on ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d The actor first explained the counter was littered with medicine because he had \u201ca bad cold,\u201d and he said that he had a mustache because of his character in the HBO mini-series \u201cShow Me A Hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really was into flaming lime Cheetos, which at the time you couldn\u2019t get on the East Coast, it\u2019s just from here\u201d he told Kimmel, whose show is filmed in Los Angeles. \u201cChili-lime, it\u2019s a very Latino kind of thing.\u201d\n\nBut why the chopsticks? Because the internet\u2019s boyfriend likes to keep it classy, of course.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a sophisticated gentleman, so I didn\u2019t want to get the powder on my fingers,\u201d Isaac said.\n\nWatch Isaac react in the clip above to fans who dressed up as him.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84729b21000039006013bc.png?cache=vrwjgf5bw9&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d3cdd1700001600b065cf.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84729b21000039006013bc.png?cache=vrwjgf5bw9&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscar-isaac-cheetos-chopsticks-viral-photo-explanation_n_5a8465e9e4b0058d55653c33", "title": "Oscar Isaac Explains Viral Photo Of Him Eating Cheetos With Chopsticks", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "We finally know the truth, and it's real classy.", "keywords": "Arts and Entertainment,oscar isaac,cheetos,chopsticks", "og": {"title": "Oscar Isaac Explains Viral Photo Of Him Eating Cheetos With Chopsticks", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84729b21000039006013bc.png?cache=vrwjgf5bw9&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84729b21000039006013bc.png?cache=vrwjgf5bw9&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscar-isaac-cheetos-chopsticks-viral-photo-explanation_n_5a8465e9e4b0058d55653c33", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "We finally know the truth, and it's real classy."}, "article": {"tag": "Arts and Entertainment,oscar isaac,cheetos,chopsticks", "section": "Latino Voices", "published_time": "2018-02-14 13:19:03 -0500", "modified_time": "2018-02-15 01:59:59 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "title": "Oscar Isaac Explains Viral Photo Of Him Eating Cheetos With Chopsticks", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a84729b21000039006013bc.png?cache=vrwjgf5bw9&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "We finally know the truth, and it's real classy.", "creator": "CaritoJuliette"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a8465e9e4b0058d55653c33", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518632343.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
