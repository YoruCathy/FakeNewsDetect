When the model turned out on last night's Met Gala red carpet, she wore a glitter-flecked La Perla slip that seemed to be channeling Rihanna\u2019s infamous naked dress from the 2014 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund awards. Jenner, who also stars in the brand\u2019s latest lingerie campaign, opted to leave little to the imagination\u2014especially with the dress\u2019s open back, which revealed a major flash of a matching black thong to make a statement both coming and going.\n\nJenner\u2019s slip also featured a bold cut-out across the front, which showed off her toned midriff and felt true to the night\u2019s avant-garde theme. She extended the spangly statement to pointed pumps in the same finish. The choice of footwear felt like a more directional alternative to, say, last season\u2019s transparent shoe, a Jenner style signature. Too many accessories would have been overkill, and Jenner did well to eschew them in favor of barely there makeup and not much else besides a knowing smile. Consider it a lesson in how to do boudoir-inspired dress on the red carpet and beyond.\n\nPhoto: Rob Latour / Shutterstock\n\nSee all of the celebrity looks from the Met Gala 2017 red carpet:", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59083ef43c5c5529b78f8736/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/rexfeatures_8770832so.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/10/2017-met-gala-article-banner-final.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5908a405a912e714d520a21b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-675689020.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb90e266ca1b56ccb172/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59087fadaa97e92b9546b383/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/77-red-carpet.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cc85a93d5d1f4489fa8b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/rexfeatures_8770826ej.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58584b057c7b375e1f73c7b4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/maria-leigh-ward.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Ward", "Maria War"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-dress-la-perla-naked", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is the Best Un-Dressed Celebrity at the Met Gala", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Maria Ward", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala.", "id": "5903c551e266ca1b56ccb0f8", "keywords": "celebrity style,runway,met gala 2020,red carpet,kendall jenner,la perla", "news_keywords": "celebrity style,runway,met gala 2020,red carpet,kendall jenner,la perla", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5903c551e266ca1b56ccb0f8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8e5bbbbc0c9df845cc/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8e5bbbbc0c9df845cc/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is the Best Un-Dressed Celebrity at the Met Gala", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-dress-la-perla-naked"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is the Best Un-Dressed Celebrity at the Met Gala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
