The legendary singer rose to fame in the 1960s by singing and performing with then-husband Ike Turner. She later embarked on a successful solo career, producing such hits as \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\"\n\nTina Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, according to Biography.com.\n\nIn the 1950s, she began performing with musician Ike Turner. They become known as the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. The group received much acclaim for their live performances and songs, including the hit song, \"Proud Mary.\"\n\nStill going strong: Tina Turner rocks out Toyota Center\n\nAfter years of domestic abuse, Tina left Ike in the late 1970s. They were married from 1962 to 1978.\n\nWhile her solo career got off to a slow start, Turner eventually achieved massive success. Her 1984 album titled Private Dancer featured the hits, \"What's Love Got to Do With It,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts, \"Better Be Good to Me,\" and the title track.\n\nTurner, who was in her mid-40s, became recognized not only for her energetic performances and hit records, but also for her signature look: short skirts that exposed her famous legs and voluminous, spiked hair.\n\nIn 1985, Turner performed on the big screen with actor Mel Gibson in the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Turner contributed the pop song \"We Don't Need Another Hero\" the film's soundtrack.\n\nStill stunning at 62: Happy birthday, Bo Derek!\n\nTurner published her autobiography, I, Tina, in 1986. The book was adapted as the 1993 film What's Love Got to Do with It, starring Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nIn 1991, Tina and Ike were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ike was unable to attend as he was serving time for drug possession. He died of an overdose in 2007.\n\nTina Turner was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018.\n\nShe has been married to Erwin Bach since July 2013.\n\nMarcy de Luna is a digital reporter specializing in social media, the famous, and food.
