According to the Daily Mail, the dress is only $135,584 (\u00a3100,000). Markle will probably pay for the dress herself, while the other wedding costs will be covered by the royal family, keeping in tradition with Kate Middleton's 2011 wedding.\n\nEither way, it's cry from the wedding dress Markle wore during her first wedding to Trevor Engelson in Jamaica, a white strapless column gown with an embellished belt.\n\nBut that's not the only time we've seen her in a wedding dress pre-royal wedding.\n\nIn the season seven finale of Suits, her character, Rachel Zane, wore an Anne Barge V-neck wedding gown with beading and delicate embroidery that retails for $6,800.\n\nBut neither of those gowns will hold a candle to the dress she wears on May 19 \u2014 and she certainly has big shoes to fill when it comes to royal wedding gowns.\n\nPrincess Diana's wedding dress cost an estimated $115,000. AP Photos\n\nPrincess Diana's wedding dress, designed by husband-and-wife team David and Elizabeth Emanuel, featured sequins, lace, 10,000 pearls, and a 25-foot train. It was estimated to cost $115,000. Years later, Kate Middleton donned a queenly and iconic Victorian inspired long-sleeved lace Alexander McQueen wedding dress, which reportedly cost $434,000, during her wedding to Prince William.\n\nWhile the Daily Mail describes Markle's gown as a \"hand-stitched, heavily beaded design,\" there's no official word yet on what her wedding dress will look like \u2014 but that hasn't prevented the world from speculating.\n\n\"Meghan is sleek and modern, and her sartorial choices of late have been guided by her best friend, Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney,\" O'Neill said.\n\n\"My bet would be that Meghan will go modern and sleek, the silhouette will be form fitting and veer away from the traditional ball gowns that have swept into cathedrals and royal chapels. The gown will be sleeved as protocol dictates, which is perfect timing as bridal fashion is enjoying a sleeve moment. There will be a dramatic train flaring out from behind the knee.\"\n\nHowever, he doesn't think the gown will be as expensive as the rumors claim it to be, saying it definitely won't be a six-figure gown, maybe even less than five figures.\n\n\"Meghan is very much an everyday girl and believes in wearing affordably priced clothes,\" O'Neill said. \"Her wedding gown will be priced in the realm of accessible gowns. This beautiful, young, dynamic woman may surprise us all as she is making up her own rules in her new world every day.\"\n\nMore on the royal wedding:", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/meghan-markle-wedding-dress-designer-cost-price-2018-5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5af0667019ee8619008b495f?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5ae39bf919ee8624008b4634?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5af07ade19ee861b008b4afb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5af0667019ee8619008b495f?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5af07ade19ee861b008b4afb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/meghan-markle-wedding-dress-designer-cost-price-2018-5", "title": "Meghan Markle's wedding dress could cost more than $135,000 \u2014 and she'll probably be the one paying for it", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Meghan Markle's wedding dress could cost more than $135,000 \u2014 and she'll probably be the one paying for it", "date": "2018-05-07", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Your Money, Royal Wedding, bridal, Weddings, Arts & Culture, Hillary Hoffower", "description": "Meghan Markle's wedding dress reportedly cost around $135,000 and is designed by Ralph & Russo, the same designer behind her engagement gown.
