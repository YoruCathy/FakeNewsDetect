Schulman denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cAlthough we never received a formal complaint, MTV and Critical Content immediately engaged an independent third party investigator,\u201d MTV said in a statement to ET. \u201cThe independent investigator found the allegations made in the YouTube videos to be not credible and without merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the results of the investigation, Catfish will resume filming. We take these matters very seriously and are committed to providing a safe working environment,\" the statement concludes.\n\nSchulman also took to Twitter to thank fans for having his back.\n\n\"Appreciate the support from you and so many others. Excited to get back to work!\" he tweeted. \"Can\u2019t express how much your support means to me. ?.\"\n\nAppreciate the support from you and so many others.

I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions -- but these claims are false.\u201d\n\nSchulman has been the host and executive producer of Catfish since 2012. In the show, Schulman and his filmmaking partner, Max Joseph, investigate whether people are telling the truth about who they say they are in their online relationships.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'Catfish' Suspended After Sexual Misconduct Claims Against Host Nev Schulman\n\n'Catfish' Star Nev Schulman Marries Laura Perlongo in Gorgeous Hamptons Ceremony\n\n'Catfish' Host Nev Schulman Reveals Wedding Date -- and It's Sooner Than You Think!\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-988303756.jpg?h=25a2d821&itok=FLVKWkzg", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa&itok=jrFzW_qQ", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa&itok=VZczaB9j", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/gettyimages-692085362.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=TnqSx9El"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa&itok=jrFzW_qQ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/catfish-to-resume-filming-after-nev-schulman-sexual-misconduct-claims-found-not-credible-104827", "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/catfish-to-resume-filming-after-nev-schulman-sexual-misconduct-claims-found-not-credible-104827", "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'", "description": "MTV released a statement announcing that they would resume production on the reality show.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa&itok=jrFzW_qQ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "MTV released a statement announcing that they would resume production on the reality show.", "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Liz Calvario\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/catfish-to-resume-filming-after-nev-schulman-sexual-misconduct-claims-found-not-credible-104827", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa&itok=jrFzW_qQ"}, "description": "MTV released a statement announcing that they would resume production on the reality show.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, News, Catfish The Tv Show, Nev Schulman", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
