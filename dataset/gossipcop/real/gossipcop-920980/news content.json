We\u2019re good friends,\u201d said the actor who plays Hollywood\u2019s biggest movie star Kyle West on the E! series. \u201cI admire her and I respect her and I think she\u2019s great. People always talk about our chemistry on the show, and it\u2019s real. That\u2019s why she got cast.\u201d\n\nHenderson, who is also known for his role as John Ross Ewing III on TNT\u2019s revival of \u201cDallas,\u201d said that he got cast on \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d before Evangelista officially got the part of his character\u2019s love interest, Megan Morrison. \u201cI got cast before her, and I went through this whole test process with everybody,\u201d the actor recalled. \u201cThere were probably 15 girls that I tested with, and she and I \u2014 the chemistry was real, it was there.\u201d\n\nREAD: Terence and DeAnn threaten Megan\u2019s blackmailer in \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d Season 1 finale\n\nAlthough they are not in a romantic relationship together in real-life, Henderson said that the chemistry between them is genuine. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more than us being friends. We work together and it\u2019s professional, but it\u2019s not fake,\u201d the 35-year-old thespian said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to figure it out or force this chemistry, it just works.\u201d\n\nDuring a chat with Yahoo TV last month, Henderson and Evangelista revealed that they met each other for the first time during a test process for \u201cThe Arrangement,\u201d acting out the exact same scene where Kyle meets Megan in a test process for Kyle\u2019s movie, \u201cThe Kill Plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just took the audition and they put it in the show. That\u2019s what they did,\u201d Evangelista said. \u201cJosh had the job and I came in to audition. It was the same exact scene. I walked into the room the same way. \u2026 It\u2019s an important scene. I think you have to sell that scene otherwise you\u2019re not gonna believe the rest of the story. Of course we have to have great chemistry, but if Megan is like a bad actress, then she\u2019s not gonna get the part.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Henderson told TooFab of the fact that he and Evangelista met the same way their characters met on the show. \u201cExactly how I met Christine is exactly how Kyle meets Megan on the show. It was with that scene, and she did an amazing job on the test, just like she did an amazing job in the scene on the show. So yeah, there\u2019s a lot of art-imitating-life moments on the show.\u201d\n\nViewers are going to see more of that chemistry in this Sunday\u2019s Season 1 finale of \u201cThe Arrangement.\u201d According to the synopsis for the episode, Kyle and Megan continue to deal with the secret that has emerged from her past. Meanwhile, Terence (Michael Vartan) and DeAnn (Lexa Doig) deal with a possible threat to the Institute for the Higher Mind.\n\n\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d Season 1 finale, titled \u201cThe New Narrative,\u201d airs on Sunday, May 7 at 10 p.m. EDT on E!", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/11/17/north-korea-said-former-vice-president-joe-biden.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/trump-has-largely-left-decisions-on-easing-lockdowns.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/04/20/apple-tim-cook-watch.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/05/05/christine-evangelista-josh-henderson.JPG", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/leader-of-italys-far-right-league-party-matteo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/kristi_l._noem_113th_congress.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-in-a-march-27.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/elon-must-sent-wrong-kind-ventilators-california-hospitals.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/messages-of-support-for-the-residents-are-displayed.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/05/05/christine-evangelista-josh-henderson.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/arrangement-stars-josh-henderson-christine-evangelista-dating-2535502", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Stars Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista Dating?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "the arrangement tv series, the arrangement cast, the arrangement season 1 finale, the arrangement spoilers, the arrangement kyle west, the arrangement megan morrison, the arrangement josh henderson, the arrangement christine evangelista, the arrangement", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/arrangement-stars-josh-henderson-christine-evangelista-dating-2535502", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Stars Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista Dating?", "description": "\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d actor Josh Henderson opened up about his relationship with his co-star, Christine Evangelista.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/05/05/christine-evangelista-josh-henderson.JPG", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/05/05/christine-evangelista-josh-henderson.JPG", "height": 667, "width": 1000, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Christian Saclao", "modified_time": "2017-05-06T06:11:19-04:00", "published_time": "2017-05-05T23:16:51-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Stars Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista Dating?", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/arrangement-stars-josh-henderson-christine-evangelista-dating-2535502", "description": "\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d actor Josh Henderson opened up about his relationship with his co-star, Christine Evangelista.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/05/05/christine-evangelista-josh-henderson.JPG"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "the arrangement tv series, the arrangement cast, the arrangement season 1 finale, the arrangement spoilers, the arrangement kyle west, the arrangement megan morrison, the arrangement josh henderson, the arrangement christine evangelista, the arrangement", "author": "Christian Saclao", "description": "\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d actor Josh Henderson opened up about his relationship with his co-star, Christine Evangelista."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494040611.0, "source": "https://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
