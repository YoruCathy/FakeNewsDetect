So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[20]\n\nWhen Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \"Lucky You\".[21] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[22] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[23][24]\n\nTo help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[6][25] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[26] but after two years transferred to the Aaron Academy, which through homeschooling could accommodate her touring schedule; she graduated a year early.[27]\n\n2004\u20132008: Career beginnings and Taylor Swift\n\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers,[28][29] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[30] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[31] Rose thought the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house[32] but left RCA Records when she was 14.[17] She later said: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[33]\n\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[34] Swift became one of Big Machine's first signings, and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[35][36] She began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after. Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[17] She wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[37] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[38] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice.\"[39] Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States, spending 157 weeks there\u2014the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. that decade.[40] As of August 2016, the album had sold over 7.75 million copies worldwide.[41]\n\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\". Swift and her mother helped \"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio.\"[42] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances, and opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour[43][44] after they fired their previous opening act, Eric Church, for playing longer than his allotted time. Church jokingly told Swift she should give him her first gold record as thanks for getting fired. She sent him her first gold record with a note that said, \"Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor.\"[45]\n\nBorchetta said that record industry peers disapproved of his signing a 16-year-old singer-songwriter, but that Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music.[6] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All were successful on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, with \"Our Song\", and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart.[46] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in the United States.[47] Swift also released the holiday album Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and the EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[48][49] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.[50]\n\nSwift won accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[51] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[52] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[53] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[54] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[55] She opened for the Rascal Flatts on their 2008 summer and fall tour.[56] In July of that year, Swift began a romance with singer Joe Jonas that ended three months later.[57][58]\n\n2008\u20132010: Fearless and acting\n\nSwift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008.[38] The lead single, \"Love Story\", was released in September 2008. It peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[59] and number one in Australia.[60] Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\" and \"Fearless\". \"You Belong with Me\" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.[61] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the top-selling album of 2009 in the United States.[62] Swift's first concert tour, the Fearless Tour, promoted the album;[63] it grossed over $63 million.[64] Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless, a concert film, was aired on television and later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[65] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour.[66]\n\nIn 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards.[69] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West.[70] The incident was the subject of controversy and widespread media attention, resulting in many Internet memes.[71] James Montgomery of MTV argued the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity\".[72] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[73] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[74] The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[75]\n\nAt the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[76] During the ceremony, Swift sang \"You Belong with Me\" and \"Rhiannon\" with Stevie Nicks. Her performance received negative reviews and caused a media backlash.[72][77] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found it \"refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub\" and described Swift as \"the most important new pop star of the past few years\".[78] Swift became the youngest artist to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.[79] Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.[80]\n\nSwift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's \"Half of My Heart\", a single featured on his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).[81] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[82] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\u2014\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[68] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One\".[83] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the country-pop song \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which became her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and her second number-two peaking song in the US. [84][85] While filming her cinematic debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner; they broke up later that year.[86][87] The romantic comedy, released in 2010, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role which the Los Angeles Times felt showed Swift had \"serious comedic potential\".[88] In a scathing review, a critic for Variety deemed her \"entirely undirected\", arguing \"she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy\".[89]\n\nSwift made her TV acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager. The New York Times noted the character allowed Swift to be \"a little bit naughty, and credibly so\".[90] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live.[91] Entertainment Weekly described her as \"this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far\", noting she \"was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines\".[92]\n\n2010\u20132014: Speak Now and Red\n\nIn August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the U.S. charts at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 (after Mariah Carey) to debut multiple tracks in the top five in one year; the other was \"Today Was a Fairytale\" at number two.[93] Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track.[94] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[38] was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, and becoming the 16th album to achieve opening week sales of one million copies.[95] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records. She earned a second entry after she became the first woman to achieve 10 track debuts on the Billboard Hot 100.[96][97] Three of the album's singles, \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", and \"Mean\", peaked in the top ten in Canada,[85] while in the US, the earlier two along with the title track peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart. Later in 2010, she briefly dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal.[98]\n\n\"Mean\" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[99] Swift performed it during the ceremony. Claire Suddath of Time felt she \"delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance\";[100] Jayme Deerwester of USA Today wrote that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have \"made her a better songwriter and live performer\".[101] Swift won other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone placed Speak Now at number 45 in its 2012 list of the \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\", writing: \"She might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click.\"[108]\n\nThe Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million.[109] In November 2011, Swift released her first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[110] The following month, she contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \"Safe & Sound\", co-written and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \"Eyes Open\". \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[111][112] Swift contributed vocals to rapper B.o.B's \"Both of Us\", released in May 2012.[113] From July to September 2012, Swift dated political heir Conor Kennedy.[114] In August, Swift released \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red.

Swift was the opening performer at the award ceremony.[213] Lover was the best-selling album by a female artist in 2019,[214] and Swift was named the year's global best-selling artist by the IFPI, becoming the first female artist to win the honor twice, having previously won in 2014.[215]\n\nIn June, Big Machine, Swift's former record label, was purchased by music manager Scooter Braun, including the masters for her first six albums.[216] Swift voiced her displeasure in a Tumblr post, saying she had been trying to buy the masters for years and describing Braun as an \"incessant, manipulative bully\".[216] In August, Swift announced plans to rerecord the albums in November 2020.[217] In November 2019, Swift said that Braun and Big Machine founder Scott Borchetta had blocked her from performing her older songs at the 2019 American Music Awards and fom using older material for her Netflix documentary Miss Americana.[218] Big Machine denied both allegations and said it was owed \"million of dollars and multiple assets\" by Swift.[219][220] In response, Swift's representatives released correspondence showing a Big Machine executive refusing to grant licenses for the documentary, and stated that Big Machine owed Swift nearly $8 million in unpaid royalties.[221] On November 18, Big Machine issued a statement saying it had \"agreed to grant all licenses of their artists' performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms\" for the American Music Awards, though it did not mention Swift by name.[222]\n\nIn November, Swift and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\" for the film Cats (2019),[223] which received a nomination for Best Original Song at the 77th Golden Globe Awards.[224] In December, she composed, recorded, and released a Christmas single, \"Christmas Tree Farm\",[225] and played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Lloyd Webber's musical Cats.[226] Critics reviewed the film negatively and noted Swift's brief role.[227] On January 23, Miss Americana premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix on January 31 to positive reviews.[228][229] The documentary includes the song \"Only the Young\", which Swift wrote after the 2018 United States elections.[230] In February 2020, Swift signed an exclusive global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group, after her sixteen-year old contract with Sony/ATV expired.[231] That month, she released a live version of Lover song, \"The Man\" and its music video.[232][233] The Lover Fest, Swift's concert tour in support of the album, had its dates cancelled or postponed to 2021 due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.[234]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nOne of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[2] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\".[235] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[236] She also attributes her \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother.[237] Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[238] and was introduced to the genre listening to \"the great female country artists of the '90s\"\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.\"[239][240] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[241] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\".[242] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[243] The band's \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[244] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette.[16] She believes Parton is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\".[245] Alt-country artists like Ryan Adams,[246] Patty Griffin[247] and Lori McKenna have also inspired Swift.[6]\n\nSwift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones,[134] Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models. Discussing McCartney and Harris, Swift has said, \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\".[6][248] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind [...] He's out there continuing to make his fans so happy. Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that.\"[249] She likes Springsteen for being \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\".[250] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older because of prioritizing music over fame.[251] Swift says of Kristofferson that he \"shines in songwriting\",[252] and admires Simon for being \"an emotional\" but \"a strong person\".[253]\n\nSwift has been influenced by other non-country artists. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears, for whom Swift had an \"unwavering devotion\".[254][255] In her high school years, she listened to emo-rock bands like Dashboard Confessional,[256] Fall Out Boy,[257] and Jimmy Eat World,[258] and pop/R&B performers like Justin Timberlake, whom she called her \"musical crush\".[259] Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel,[260] Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\".[261] Discussing Madonna, Swift said: \"One element of Madonna's career that really takes center stage is how many times she's reinvented herself. It's easier to stay in one look, one comfort zone, one musical style. It's inspiring to see someone whose only predictable quality is being unpredictable.\"[262]\n\nMusical style\n\nSwift's music contains elements of pop,[263] synth-pop,[264] country,[265] country pop[266] and rock.[264] She described herself as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she characterized as a \"sonically cohesive pop album\".[267] Rolling Stone wrote: \"[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\"[268] According to The New York Times, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country\u2014a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar\u2014but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville.\"[269] The Guardian wrote that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory.\"[270]\n\nSwift's vocals were described by Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter as \"sweet, but soft\".[271] The Los Angeles Times identified Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture in studio recordings as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy\".[272] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, wrote: \"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\"[273] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice wrote that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.\"[274] NPR Music described her singing as personal and conversational thanks to her \"exceptional gift for inflection\", but also suffers from a \"wobbly pitch and tight, nasal delivery\".[275] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals are \"fine\", but they do not match those of her peers.[271] Swift has been praised for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[276]\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\"[6] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is \"not the best technical singer\", but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got\".[277] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \"put a lot of work\" into improving it.[278] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[279] She has said that she only feels nervous performing \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows\".[280]\n\nSongwriting\n\nSwift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[281] She often addresses the \"anonymous crushes of her high school years\" and celebrities in her early songs.[282] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[283] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: \"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\"[284] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to \"mine her personal life for music ... is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\".[285] Swift said that not all of her songs are factual and they are sometimes based on observations.[286] Aside from clues provided in her liner notes, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically \"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus.\"[287]\n\nSwift during her Speak Now World Tour in Pittsburgh , 2011\n\nFor a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated\u2014a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way\u2014that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist. Swift in response to criticism of her songwriting[288]\n\nThe Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years \"with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\" over the course of her first two albums.[270] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but \"none made great records so explicitly about their teens\". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[289] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect \"between fairy tales and the reality of love\".[290] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[248] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[291][292] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[237] Swift frequently includes \"a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative\".[293]\n\nRolling Stone describes Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[294] According to The Village Voice, she often uses third-verse point of view reversals.[293] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardian's words, \"she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot\".[270] Slant Magazine adds, \"to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album\".[295] Although reviews of Swift's work are \"almost uniformly positive\", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[6]\n\nMusic videos\n\nSwift has collaborated with many different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She has her own production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., which is credited with producing the music video for \"Me!\".[296] In 2010, Swift co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White.[297] In 2011, she continued to collaborate with White on the music videos for \"Mean\" and \"Ours\". Swift developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\".[298] In an interview, White elaborated that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[299] Swift wrote the concept for the \"Ours\" music video and then brought in White to direct, describing her vision of both videos as being \"storylines\".[300][301]\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\u2014four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft.[302] In 2016, Swift worked with American Express for her \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and released the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience. Swift received starring and executive producer credit, and in 2015 won a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Interactive Program category for the app.[303]\n\nIn 2018, Swift developed the concept, wrote the treatment for, and starred in the music video for the Sugarland song \"Babe\".[304] In 2019, she co-directed the music videos for \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, \"You Need to Calm Down\" with Drew Kirsch and \"Lover with Kirsch.[305][306] She also co-executive produced the second of them with Todrick Hall.[307] The music video for Swift's 2020 single \"The Man\" marked her official solo directorial debut.[308]\n\nPublic image\n\nSwift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention.[309] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \"slut-shaming\" remark directed toward her.[310] The New York Times asserted in 2013 that her \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\". They questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis\".[311] Swift has said she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public;[309] she believes that talking about it can be \"a career weakness\".[312] In 2015, singer Ray Stevens released his album Here We Go Again which included the single \"Taylor Swift is Stalking Me\".[313] In 2020, Swift revealed she struggled with an eating disorder in the past.[314]\n\nRolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\"[27] The magazine also takes note of her \"ease with glad-handing\",[35] and The Hollywood Reporter has credited her as \"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\".[315] While presenting Swift with an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\".[316] Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model.[317] Swift is one of the most-followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.[318][319] She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \"Swiftmas\".[320] She considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans,[321] and has said they are \"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\".[322]\n\nOften described by the media as \"America's Sweetheart\",[323] Swift insists she does not \"live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots,[324] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[325] Vogue named Swift an Icon of American Style in 2011.[326] In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.[327] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards,[328] and ranked first on Maxim's Hot 100 list.[329]\n\nOther ventures\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSwift's philanthropic efforts have been recognized by the Do Something Awards and the Tennessee Disaster Services.[330][331] She has also received The Big Help Award for her \"dedication to helping others\" and \"inspiring others through action\",[332] and the Ripple of Hope Award for her \"dedication to advocacy at such a young age\".[333] In 2008, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the flood in Iowa that year.[334] Swift has performed at charity relief events including Sydney's Sound Relief concert.[335] She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album.[336] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV.[337] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the US, raising more than $750,000.[338] In 2016, she made a $1 million donation to Louisiana flood relief efforts and donated to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[339][340] In 2017, Swift made a donation to the Houston Food Bank after Hurricane Harvey struck the city.[341] In 2020, she donated $1 million to relief efforts for a series of tornadoes that impacted Tennessee.[342]\n\nSwift is a supporter of the arts and donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School in 2010 to help refurbish the school auditorium.[343] In 2012, she pledged $4 million to fund the building of a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville.[344] That year, she also partnered with textbook rental company Chegg to donate $60,000 to the music departments of six US colleges.[345] In 2013, Swift donated $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony.[346] Swift also promotes children's literacy; in 2009, she donated $250,000 to various schools around the country to improve education.[347] Her other endeavors to promote literacy included donating 6,000 Scholastic books to the Reading Public Library in Pennsylvania;[348] 14,000 books to the Nashville Public Library in Tennessee;[349] and 25,000 books to New York City schools in 2015.[350] In 2015, Swift donated all proceeds from the sale of the promotional single \"Welcome to New York\", at the time $50,000, to the New York City Department of Education,[351] and the proceeds from the \"Wildest Dreams\" music video to the African Parks Foundation.[352] In 2019, Swift sampled a song by the Toronto-based Regent Park School of Music in her album Lover, thus enabling the school to earn royalties from her album; she also made a personal donation.[353]\n\nIn 2007, she launched a campaign to protect children from online predators, in partnership with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.[354] In 2009, Swift recorded a Sound Matters public service announcement (PSA) to make listeners aware of the importance of listening \"responsibly\" to prevent hearing impairment.[355] She has donated items to several charities for auction, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the UNICEF Tap Project, MusiCares, and Feeding America.[356] As a recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee.[357] In 2012, Swift participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing \"Ronan\", a song she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma.
