Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra are expecting a daughter, the Teen Mom OG couple revealed exclusively to Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cI was so shocked that it was a girl because I for sure thought it was a boy!\u201d Lowell, 26, tells Us. \u201cTyler knew the sex before I did. When we did our gender reveal, I was so shocked I almost cried because I wanted a boy so badly. I\u2019m super excited it\u2019s a girl now. Since our miscarriage, I just am thankful to get another chance, and as long as it\u2019s healthy, that\u2019s all that matters!\u201d\n\nAs for trying for a boy in the future, Lowell tells Us she and Baltierra, 26, have already \u201ctalked about trying again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe definitely want to have a boy, but if God only wants us to have girls, then that\u2019s just what it is,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt will be a houseful of ALL girls! Poor Tyler!\u201d\n\nUs broke the news last month that Lowell is pregnant with the pair\u2019s third child. The high school sweethearts, who wed in 2015, share 3-year-old daughter Nova and placed their eldest daughter, Carly, now 9, for adoption in 2009.\n\nLowell previously revealed during a February episode of Teen Mom OG that she suffered a miscarriage. The pair refer to her current pregnancy as \u201cour rainbow baby,\u201d a term used to describe children born after miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal loss or infant or child loss.\n\nShe previously admitted to Us that her pregnancy was \u201ca huge shock at first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were not planning it, especially after the miscarriage and how I went downhill with my mental illness,\u201d she explained, referring to her struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts. \u201cAt first, Tyler was very shocked and nervous, but he obviously came around to it and was super pumped once the initial shock wore off and it sunk in.\u201d\n\nBaltierra echoed his wife\u2019s thoughts, telling Us in September that he was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cnervous since [they] were using protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the initial shock wore off, I starting getting excited due to the fact that the universe obviously wanted this baby to come into the world no matter what!\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd after the miscarriage, this is truly a blessing \u2026 like every child!\u201d\n\nTeen Mom OG airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nFor the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Catelynn-Lowell-and-Tyler-Baltierra-gender-reveal.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Catelynn-Lowell-and-Tyler-Baltierra-gender-reveal-2.jpg?w=279", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Catelynn-Lowell-and-Tyler-Baltierra-gender-reveal.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Catelynn-Lowell-and-Tyler-Baltierra-gender-reveal-1.jpg?w=247", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Catelynn-Lowell-and-Tyler-Baltierra-gender-reveal.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/teen-mom-ogs-catelynn-lowell-tyler-baltierra-expecting-a-baby-girl/", "title": "Teen Mom OG\u2019s Catelynn Lowell, Tyler Baltierra Expecting a Baby Girl", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 stars Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra revealed the gender of their third child exclusively to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Boy or Girl?
