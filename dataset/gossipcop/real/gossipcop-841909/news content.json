For Adele, the answer was right at her fingertips. When fellow Brit Harry Styles turned 21 in 2015, she gave him the gift of music \u2014 her music, actually.\n\n\u201cFor my 21st, she gave me one of her albums, 21,\u201d the former One Direction singer revealed in an interview with BBC Radio 1\u2019s Nick Grimshaw, set to air Friday, April 7.\n\nAnd Adele had good reason for selecting that album \u2014 the bestselling disc of 2011 and 2012. (It also netted her seven of her 15 Grammys.) Explained Styles, now 23, \u201c[She] said, \u2018I did some pretty cool stuff when I was 21, good luck.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Geez.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Styles \u2014 who will release his debut solo single \u201cSign of the Times\u201d on the show \u2014 is still tight with the 28-year-old singer.\n\nWhen he rang in his 23rd birthday at Cafe Habana in Malibu, California, Adele was among the roughly 30 guests. As the birthday boy downed shots of Casamigos Tequila with the liquor\u2019s cocreator Rande Gerber (his wife, Cindy Crawford, and 15-year-old daughter, Kaia Gerber, also attended), Adele sipped margaritas.\n\nAn onlooker tells Us that the \u201cHello\u201d singer later stood on the couch to watch others perform karaoke. Styles listened intently as well. The onlooker says when one singer belted out a rendition of Prince\u2019s \u201cKiss,\u201d Styles showed his approval.\n\nHot Brits!\n\n\u201cHe was smiling during the entire song and threw a fist pump in the air at the chorus,\u201d says the onlooker. \u201cHe looked like he was having a really good time with his friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-adele-3d51f2c9-df1f-4d26-ab99-7eee4d3817f8.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-adele-e5af6692-a102-4a11-981c-ac53f216c362.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-adele-e5af6692-a102-4a11-981c-ac53f216c362.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/harry-styles-reveals-what-adele-gave-him-for-his-birthday-w475488/", "title": "Harry Styles Reveals the Funny Gift Adele Gave Him for His 21st Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "When Harry Styles turned 21 two years ago, Adele gave him an interesting gift \u2014\u00a0find out more!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Harry Styles Reveals the Funny Gift Adele Gave Him for His 21st Birthday", "description": "When Harry Styles turned 21 two years ago, Adele gave him an interesting gift \u2014\u00a0find out more!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/harry-styles-reveals-what-adele-gave-him-for-his-birthday-w475488/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:18:53+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-adele-e5af6692-a102-4a11-981c-ac53f216c362.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-adele-e5af6692-a102-4a11-981c-ac53f216c362.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-08T00:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:18:53+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "When Harry Styles turned 21 two years ago, Adele gave him an interesting gift \u2014\u00a0find out more!", "title": "Harry Styles Reveals the Funny Gift Adele Gave Him for His 21st Birthday", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-adele-e5af6692-a102-4a11-981c-ac53f216c362.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491609660.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
