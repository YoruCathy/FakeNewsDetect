He was my saviour. Finding a companion at that time in my life changed me.\u201d\n\nHe later says: \u201cThen when my mum got cancer, I felt so bloody picked on by God.\n\n\u201cI took it very badly, very badly indeed. I\u2019ve never felt that kind of depression.\u201d\n\nThe pair met in a hotel lobby when they fell in love almost immediately.\n\nThe Mirror says of the programme: \u201cGeorge speaks very movingly about Anselmo being the first love of his life and how important he was in his life.\n\n\u201cIt is very emotional and he clearly never forgot him and left a huge \u00adimpression on George.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Woman gives birth to baby thanks to secret IVF donation by George Michael\n\nThe first trailer for the show, released last week, hears George describe how he was \u201cterribly lonely\u201d during the height of his stardom.\n\nThe film includes contributions from a long list of his friends and associates, including his neighbour Kate Moss.\n\nStevie Wonder, Elton John, Ricky Gervais, Nile Rogers, Mark Ronson, Tracey Emin, Mary J. Blige, Jean Paul Gaultier, James Corden, Tony Bennett and Liam Gallagher also feature in the film.\n\nGallagher labels the late singer, who he had become friends with in his final years, a \u201cmodern day Elvis\u201d.\n\nHis final song, a re-worked version of his 80s song Fantasy, was released last week with music producer Nile Rogers.\n\nGeorge Michael: Freedom will air on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday 16 October./em>", "images": ["https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/reddit-blue_cabce50a.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/close-icon_cb8496fe.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/snapchat-icon_11d51e0f.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pink-news-footer-logo.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/twitter-blue_5d175d8c.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hugh-Grant-Notting-Hill-213x140.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1095299/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-123930452-1024x833.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-2020-04-19-at-01.23.44-233x130.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1485835648227616&ev=PageView\n\t\t&noscript=1", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/facebook-icon_3f0f8f55.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/a3ef4dde-946e-47bb-994b-373cc734d1ce-e1587257326549-206x140.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sam_john-196x140.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/burger-menu_29698793.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lgbt-siblings-189x140.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-123930452.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EVt6DUGXsAAzUDy-213x140.jpeg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/twitter-icon_8cc3f7a6.png", "https://secure.rote8mino.com/187675.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b9cuJqjzzENZA.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=795355097161815&ev=NoScript", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18667741&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/facebook-blue_f9dfdf3b.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/celine_gaga-196x140.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pink-news-logo-1.png", "https://www.pinknews.co.uk/images/2017/10/GettyImages-74124076-650x473.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/youtube-icon_7ded36d1.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/globe-icon_3a107b9b.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/search-icon_c83badc4.svg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-79x140.jpg", "https://www.pinknews.co.uk/images/2017/09/GettyImages-630607638-650x433.jpg", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/email-blue_c49276e6.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/insta-icon_c77815eb.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/pinknews/dist/images/snapchat-blue_170ffcb0.png", "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/stars-you-didnt-know-are-gay-233x132.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s31242.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-123930452.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vic Parsons", "Josh Milton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/11/george-michael-said-he-felt-picked-on-by-god-in-last-ever-interview/", "title": "George Michael said he \u2018felt picked on by god\u2019 in last ever interview", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "He finished compiling the documentary less than 36 hours before he died.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "George Michael said he 'felt picked on by god' in last ever interview", "description": "He finished compiling the documentary less than 36 hours before he died.", "url": "https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/11/george-michael-said-he-felt-picked-on-by-god-in-last-ever-interview/", "site_name": "PinkNews -
