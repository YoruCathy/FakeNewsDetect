There\u2019s no way.\u2019 No, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d live this long. Everyday I get up and I want to pinch myself. I feel very blessed, but I\u2019ve worked for it.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nAfter taking a 15 year break from 1990 to 2005, Fonda has since been working consistently in movies and TV and is currently starring in the Netflix show Grace & Frankie as well as the upcoming movie Book Club.\n\nIt\u2019s a much different life than she thought she\u2019d have.
