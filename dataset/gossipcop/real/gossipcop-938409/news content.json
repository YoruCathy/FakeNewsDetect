I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety & prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his sh** together is a very major problem.\"\n\n\"Let's please stop doing that,\" she continued. \"Of course I didn't share how hard or scary it was while it was happening but it was. I will continue to pray from the bottom of my heart that he figures it all out and that any other woman in this position does as well.\"\n\nAn official for the Los Angeles Police Department told ET last Thursday that 26-year-old Miller was the driver involved in a traffic collision with a power pole at 12:50 a.m. that morning in the San Fernando Valley in California. According to the official, Miller and his two passengers fled the scene on foot. A short time later, Miller was arrested without incident at 1:50 a.m. for a misdemeanor DUI.\n\nMiller has talked openly about his sobriety in the past. He's credited producer Rick Rubin for helping him get sober in 2015, though in an April 2017 interview, he said he was now \"living regularly.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve spent a good time very sober and now I\u2019m just, like, living regularly I think it\u2019s important,\" he told W magazine. \"I don\u2019t believe in absolute anything, but I think not sharing that type of information, because it becomes like, 'Oh he\u2019s sober, oh he\u2019s not, oh he has a beer, oh my god.' I just realized some things are important to just keep for yourself. That was a learning experience. But it was important to let everyone know that I wasn\u2019t doing f**king crazy amounts of hard drugs. That was good to get out there.\"\n\nUp until Grande's tweet on Wednesday, the exes appeared to have an extremely amicable breakup. After news of the split broke, 24-year-old Grande took to her Instagram Stories to share a sweet message about Miller.\n\n\"Hi! This is one of my best friends in the whole world and favorite people on the planet Malcolm McCormick,\" she wrote, referring to Miller's legal name. \"I respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us!\"\n\n\"Unconditional love is not selfish,\" she continued. \"It is wanting the best for that person even if at the moment, it's not you. I cant wait to know and support you forever and I'm so proud of you!!\"\n\nA source previously told ET that the couple had been on the rocks for \u201ca while\u201d prior to their split shortly after the Coachella Music Festival in April. The source also added that Grande's relationship with 24-year-old Davidson is \u201cnew,\" and that the singer is \u201cis in a very good place and very happy right now.\u201d\n\nWatch below:\n\nAriana Grande and 'SNL' Star Pete Davidson are 'Casually Dating' Following Mac Miller Split This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
