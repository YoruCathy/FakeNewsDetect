She's healthy. She's working on her sobriety, and she's getting the help she needs. That in itself encourages me about her future and about the future of our family.\"\n\nDianna got permission from Demi before appearing on the news channel where she opened up about her reaction to the apparent overdose. She said, \u201cIt's still a really difficult thing to talk about. I literally start to shake a little bit when I start to remember what happened that day.\"\n\nDemi\u2019s assistant was the one who called Dianna, who \u201cwas in shock\u201d over the news. She added, \u201cI didn't know what to say. It was just something that I never, ever expected to hear, as a parent, about any of my kids.\"\n\nAfter learning that Demi was conscious but not talking, Dianna \u201cknew at that point that we were in trouble.\u201d\n\nDianna and Demi\u2019s sisters Dallas and Madison rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital to see Demi. She shared, \u201cDallas and Madison and I jumped out of the car at the emergency room and ran into the emergency room to be by her side. She just didn't look good \u2014 at all. She was in bad shape. But I said to her, 'Demi, I'm here. I love you.' And at that point she said back to me, 'I love you, too.'\"\n\nDe la Garza said she relied on faith to get her through. \"From that point on, I never allowed myself to ever think that things weren't going to be okay,\" she said. \"I prayed, of course, all the way to the hospital, and my faith is strong. I think that was one of things that got me through the next couple of days when she was in critical condition. We just didn't know for two days if she was going to make it or not.\"\n\nDianna also showed her appreciation to the doctors and fans, pointing out, \u201cI just feel like the reason she's alive today is because of the millions of prayers that went up that day when everybody found out what was happening. I don't think she would be here if it hadn't been for those prayers and the good doctors and Cedars-Sinai. They were the best. I couldn't have asked for a better team of people to save her life.\"", "images": ["https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/16/christina-anstead-insta-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/02/29/kate-upton-insta-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/12/20/mark-consuelos-kelly-ripa-getty-1-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2017/02/09/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovato-mom-getty-1200x630.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/16/becki-newton-chris-diamantopoulos-gettyimages-468513156-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/17/roman-reigns-galina-gettyimages-1161879716-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/screen-shot-2018-08-05-at-10-17-300x211-2.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovato-mom-getty-825x580.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/14/extra-morningsave-sidebar-hp-placement-300x190-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/17/zach-justice-mindy-shiben-lifetime-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/02/17/mingus-reedus-getty-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/11/11/tsr-horizontal-2.png", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/07/25/demi-lovato-getty-300x211-2.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/07/27/demi-lovato-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/01/27/camila-cabello-performs-at-the-62nd-annual-grammya-awards-116599-3114b-jpg-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/18/lauren-alaina-getty-510x600.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/04/08/gayle-king-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/03/20/katie-lee-gettyimages-1143146702-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/11/katie-couric-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/04/demi-lovato-selena-gomez-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/01/30/fiji-water-x-jessie-j-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/16/chris-cuomo-cristina-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2017/10/23/whitney-bischoff-ricky-angel-backgrid-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/17/shanna-moakler-insta-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/17/roman-reigns-galina-gettyimages-1161879716-825x580.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/10/08/nikki-bella-brie-getty-510x600.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2020/04/03/tiger-king-netflix-380x447-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovato-mom-getty-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovatos-mom-speaks-out-after-her-apparent-overdose/", "title": "Demi Lovato\u2019s Mom Speaks Out After Her Apparent Overdose", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"extratv": 15676578, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@extratv", "title": "Demi Lovato\u2019s Mom Speaks Out After Her Apparent Overdose", "description": "Demi Lovato's mom is opening up on her health.", "image": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovato-mom-getty-1200x630.jpg"}, "msvalidate.01": "0E70C51413A3322437EB864B93EEBD17", "keywords": "demi lovato, dianna, mom, overdose, health", "description": "Demi Lovato's mom is opening up on her health.", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"url": "https://extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovatos-mom-speaks-out-after-her-apparent-overdose/", "site_name": "Extra", "type": "article", "title": "Demi Lovato\u2019s Mom Speaks Out After Her Apparent Overdose", "description": "Demi Lovato's mom is opening up on her health.", "image": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/19/demi-lovato-mom-getty-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 18489729593, "pages": 26676834754}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537286400.0, "source": "http://extratv.com", "summary": ""}
