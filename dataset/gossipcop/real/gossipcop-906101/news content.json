Stranger Things have happened.\n\nHarbour seems to have a penchant for fellow thespians. He was previously engaged to Those Who Can\u2019t actress Maria Thayer and he dated Julia Stiles from 2011-2012. Now, he appears to be getting close to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star Sudol.\n\nGolden Globes 2018 Red Carpet Fashion: The Hottest Couples\n\nThe 42-year-old was spotted exiting the BAFTA Tea Party with Sudol, 33, on January 6 in L.A. \u201cThey left arm in arm,\u201d an onlooker told Us Weekly. \u201cAlison was teasing and joking with him. They seemed very much like a couple.\u201d At the bash, Harbour and the Harry Potter alum made the rounds together, stopping to chat with Lady Bird director Greta Gerwig.\n\nOne day later, the pair arrived at the Golden Globe Awards in the same vehicle \u2014 though Harbour, who was nominated for his role as tortured police chief Jim Hopper in Stranger Things, walked the red carpet on his own. Harbour and Sudol were reunited inside where they sat together and they both attended the Netflix afterparty.\n\nGolden Globes: The Best Dresses of All Time\n\nHarbour opened up about his fantasy girlfriend in an October interview with Women\u2019s Health. \u201cI\u2019m easily swept away, but I\u2019m trying not to be as much. I\u2019m better at the fantasy of relationships than I am at the daily real life, but I\u201dm trying to steer myself into a realist,\u201d the Dartmouth College grad revealed. \u201cWhat I find most exciting now is sharp, intelligent, insightful women. People who are deep thinking, who have sort of a weird way of looking at the universe are wildly attractive to me. So if I can find one of those gals who can stand me, then maybe I might have something thing.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902373296_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom2.jpg?crop=64px%2C0px%2C1936px%2C1017px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902373296_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom2.jpg?crop=52px%2C0px%2C1948px%2C1101px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902344256_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom.jpg?w=220", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902373296_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom2.jpg?crop=64px%2C0px%2C1936px%2C1017px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/is-stranger-things-actor-david-harbour-dating-alison-sudol/", "title": "Is \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Actor David Harbour Dating Alison Sudol?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 actor David Harbour and Alison Sudol have been spending time together \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Actor David Harbour Dating Alison Sudol?", "description": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 actor David Harbour and Alison Sudol have been spending time together \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/is-stranger-things-actor-david-harbour-dating-alison-sudol/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-09T20:54:47+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902373296_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom2.jpg?crop=64px%2C0px%2C1936px%2C1017px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902373296_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom2.jpg?crop=64px%2C0px%2C1936px%2C1017px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-01-09T20:39:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-09T20:54:47+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 actor David Harbour and Alison Sudol have been spending time together \u2014 get the details", "title": "Is \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Actor David Harbour Dating Alison Sudol?", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/902373296_alison-sudol-david-harbour-zoom2.jpg?crop=64px%2C0px%2C1936px%2C1017px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515530393.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
