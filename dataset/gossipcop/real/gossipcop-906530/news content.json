County Sheriff's Office confirmed to ET that a sexual battery report was filed with Malibu/Lost Hills Station detectives against the singer, alleging that an incident had taken place in 2016.\n\nThe accuser, actress Tracey Birdsall alleged to TMZthat in 2016, she was returning a salad spinner to Seal, when she claimed he attempted to force himself on her and groped her breasts.\n\nAt the time, a rep for Seal told ET, \"Seal vehemently denies the recent accusations made against him by a former neighbor for alleged misconduct of more than a year ago. He intends to vigorously defend himself against these false allegations.\"\n\nJust days before the allegations came to light, Seal caused some controversy on social media, calling out Hollywood hypocrisy with a past photo of Oprah Winfrey kissing Harvey Weinstein on the cheek, before later clarifying that he has \"enormous respect\" for her.\n\nWatch the video below for more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSeal 'Vehemently Denies' Sexual Battery Allegations by Former Neighbor\n\nSeal Clarifies Oprah Winfrey Post, Says He Has \u2018Enormous Respect\u2019 for Her\n\nSeal Slams Oprah Winfrey, Implies She Knew About Harvey Weinstein's Misconduct\n\nSeal Clarifies For His Controversial Oprah Winfrey Post Kissing Harvey Weinstein This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
