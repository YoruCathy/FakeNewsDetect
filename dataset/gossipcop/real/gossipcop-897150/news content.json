I also asked why this information was being withheld, and why, according to standard theatre practice the issue had not been raised with me during the production via stage management, the director, my fellow actors or anyone at management level. However, no response was forthcoming,\u201d he added.\n\nA Sydney Theatre Company spokeswoman reportedly said that they had \u201creceived a complaint alleging that Mr Geoffrey Rush had engaged in inappropriate behavior\u201d after his \u201cengagement with the company had ended,\u201d but did not elaborate on the nature of the complaint.\n\nRELATED: Matt Lauer Allegedly Harassed Multiple
