My fans too, I feel they gave me a reason to live and I'm forever grateful.\"\n\nHer daily struggle to stay sober\n\nLast year the \"Sorry Not Sorry\" singer was honored with the Spirit of Sobriety Award during the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular.\n\n\"Every day is a battle,\" she said.\n\n\"You just have to take it one day at a time; some days are easier than others and some days you forget about drinking and using, but for me, I work on my physical health, which is important, but my mental health as well,\" Lovato said, adding that she was seeing her therapist twice a week. \"I make sure I stay on my medications. I go to AA meetings. I do what I can physically in the gym. I make it a priority.\"\n\nOpening up about being bipolar\n\nIn 2015 Lovato was spokeswoman for the \"Be Vocal: Speak Up for Mental Health\" campaign and talked to Women's Health about why she went public with her mental health issues.\n\n\"I remember sitting with my manager and my family and talking to them about whether or not to speak out about the issues that I was dealing with,\" she said. \"I knew that there were two options: I could either not talk about my stint in rehab and hope that it went away, or I could talk about it and inspire people to get help for their issues, as well, so that's exactly what I did.\"\n\nHer sobriety relapse after six years\n\nLast month Lovato released the song \"Sober\" in which she revealed she had relapsed.\n\n\"I'm so sorry I'm not sober anymore/And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again/I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human,\" Lovato sang.\n\nSoon after she tweeted a video of her emotional performance of the song in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nTonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. It will never be forgotten \u2764\ufe0f @rockinriolisboa pic.twitter.com/cv51ssaqu4 \u2014 Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) June 24, 2018\n\n\"Tonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life,\" she tweeted. \"Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey.
