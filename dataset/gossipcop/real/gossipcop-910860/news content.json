Watch the clip on E! here.\n\n\n\n\u201cJosh gets on my ever-loving last f\u2014ing d\u2014 nerve,\u201d June vented to Geno. \u201cI told him he needs to get a better job if he\u2019s going to support my grandchild. Every time he thinks that I let my guard down, I\u2019ll be right behind him saying, \u2018Boom motherf\u2014er.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPumpkin and Efird, 19, welcomed their first child, daughter Ella Grace Efird, in December. But before the baby arrived, June shared concerned that her daughter would face the same struggles she did as a teen mom.\n\n\u201cPumpkin knows that ain\u2019t none of my babies\u2019 daddies stuck around,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want the same thing to happen to her.
