Athletes are subsequently given less time to master the skills needed to impress the judges and fans. This has led the 10 participating athletes to strive harder to bring their A-game week after week.\n\n\"In the context of doing the show, you don't get the sense of who these people are [in four weeks]. Or as we say in the reality biz, 'the journey,'\" Bergeron, 63, told Access Wednesday. \"It's pretty much a ballroom bloodbath. I have a feeling that come June 1, I'll be going: 'Did that even happen?\"\n\nEach week, the contestant's fate is determined by combining the judge's grades with the number of votes they accumulated from viewers. In its first two weeks, the long-running reality competition series eliminated two couples with the lowest combined scores. Viewers tuning in to week three Monday will see the remaining six couples battle it out to survive a triple elimination round. Therefore, only three competing partners will have a shot at winning the competition.\n\nAhead of the Season 26 premiere, showrunner Andrew Llinares discussed the competitive nature of the show's all-athletes edition. \"It's going to be super-competitive,\" Llinares told E! News in April. \"I think the fact that it's four weeks and 10 couples, we're going to see things change very quickly right way through the season. And the other thing about athletes, of course, is these are people who compete for a living, who train for a living, so I think what we're going to see potentially is the most competitive season ever.\"\n\nEarly predictions from Goldderby.com pegged Adam Rippon as the winner, whereas oddsmakers at SportsBettingDime.com suggested fellow figure skater Mirai Nagasu would win it all. However, NBA legend and former DWTS contestant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2014who was eliminated alongside partner Lindsay Arnold Monday\u2014shared his predictions as to who will win Season 26.\n\n\"I think it's probably going to be one of the dancers, Adam or Mirai, because they do it every day,\" Abdul-Jabbar, 71, said on Good Morning America on Tuesday. \"That's what they do for a living, so I expect them to be able to execute. They've got great presence on the dance floor, and their execution of all the moves was impeccable.\"\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nABC/Kelsey McNeal", "images":
