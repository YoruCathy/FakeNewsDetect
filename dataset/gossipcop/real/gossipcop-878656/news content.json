I have a gift, and I like to help people.\u201d\n\nIn response, Dunham said: \u201cIt\u2019s so true. I\u2019m mad. Can I borrow your bat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny time, my dear. Darryl Strawberry\u2019s is bigger though. #SwampMule,\u201d Dykstra said.\n\nDunham concluded the Twitter spat with a tweet saying she was \u201cexcited\u201d about her new \u201cstalker\u201d \u2014 prompting Dykstra to drop his most cringeworthy diss yet.\n\n\u201cI love when they\u2019re trying so hard to act like they\u2019re playing hard to get!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLenny was quick as hell here,\u201d wrote one person.\n\n\u201cLenny\u2026gross. Have some self-respect,\u201d another said.\n\nSBNation reporter Matt Allaire added, \u201cslow down on the locker room talk lenny.\u201d\n\nDykstra, who was the scrappy former leadoff hitter for the Mets from 1985 to 1989, has garnered quite the reputation as one of Major League Baseball\u2019s biggest bad boys over the years.\n\nThe World Series winner recently made headlines for allegedly trashing a ritzy Hamptons hotel room \u2014 and attempting to swipe the towels, bedsheets and receptionist\u2019s sunglasses.\n\nHe appeared to find out about Dunham\u2019s post after one of his followers flagged it up to him Thursday night.\n\n\u201cThanks, dude. I responded,\u201d Dykstra said.\n\nThe user replied, \u201cLmao Lenny, thank you for this.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, Dunham currently runs a newsletter called \u201cLenny Letter\u201d \u2014 which some users pointed out Thursday.\n\n\u201cLenny Letter, but run by Lenny Dykstra,\u201d joked NY Mag writer Gabriella Paiella.\n\n\u201cThe sex tape names itself,\u201d tweeted Ben Miller.\n\nConnor Goldsmith added, \u201cnow THIS is a lenny letter.\u201d", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lenny.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lenny.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lenny.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["September"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/09/07/lenny-dykstra-tries-to-slide-into-lena-dunhams-dms/", "title": "Lenny Dykstra\u2019s seduction of \u2018horny\u2019 Lena Dunham went horribly wrong", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
