Our businesses are open 24/7 and, of course, we\u2019re always working and grinding. But then I started talking to her and then realised, very quickly, just how wrong I was.\"\n\nOhanian co-founded the news website Reddit in 2005 and became a multi-millionaire aged 23 when he sold it 16 months later. He met Williams at a cafe in Italy in 2015 and improved the tennis ace's website with a superior \"tech strategy\" while also helping secure \"deal flows with sponsorships and investments.\"\n\nThe pair got married in 2017 and Ohanian said Williams has inspired him in business.\n\n\"It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I\u2019m working towards in my own career,\" he said.\n\nOhanian and Williams had a daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September last year. Since then, Williams has returned to tennis and almost captured her first major since being a mom, what would have been her 24th Grand Slam title, when she reached the 2018 Wimbledon Championships final \u2014 but she missed out to Angelique Kerber.\n\nOhanian co-founded Initialized Capital in 2010, is an Open Internet activist (an advocate for net neutrality), and is widely regarded as \"one of the most creative people in business.\"", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5b6053d6b354cd21008b48d7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5b60544864dce81a008b476f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/alexis-ohanian-marriage-to-serena-williams-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness-2018-7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b6053d6b354cd21008b48d7?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b60544864dce81a008b476f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alexis-ohanian-marriage-to-serena-williams-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness-2018-7", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "date": "2018-07-31", "news_keywords": "Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanian, Tennis, Reddit, Alan Dawson", "description": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian says he learned a lot about working hard and 'grinding' when he started talking to tennis champion Serena Williams.", "author": "Alan Dawson", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Sports", "og": {"title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "description": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian says he learned a lot about working hard and 'grinding' when he started talking to tennis champion Serena Williams.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alexis-ohanian-marriage-to-serena-williams-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness-2018-7", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5b60544864dce81a008b476f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-31", "sailthru.tags": "Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanian, Tennis, Reddit, Alan Dawson", "sailthru.description": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian says he learned a lot about working hard and 'grinding' when he started talking to tennis champion Serena Williams.", "sailthru.author": "Alan Dawson", "sailthru.verticals": "sportspage, sai", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5b605405e199f335008b47b4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5b605405e199f335008b47b4?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SportsInsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "control", "pfi-wider-content": "control", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "variant", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "control"}, "viking-id": "5b6056b873f5a72c008b4944", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532966400.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
