E! News reported that Theroux prefered keeping a low profile, which just wasn\u2019t possible when married to a Hollywood A-lister like Aniston.\n\nA source confirmed, \u201cJennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cThe initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.\u201d\n\nNext: This played a major role in their split.\n\n4.
