Elgort was also nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for playing the part of getaway driver baby in Baby Driver. He lost out to James Franco in The Disaster Artist.\n\nBased on the novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of a 16-year-old girl with cancer (Woodley) who meets and falls for 17-year-old Augustus Waters (Elgort), an ex-basketball player and amputee.\n\nDespite neither winning an accolade, the duo seemed happy enough just bumping into one another in the ballroom and cuddled up for a snap.\n\n\u201cShe deserves all happiness in the world,\u201d Elgort wrote on Instagram alongside the image. \u201cTo be in the same room at the Golden Globes with a woman who helped guide me early in my career when she was already a Golden Globe nominee, was a surreal moment.
