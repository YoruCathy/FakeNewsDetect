Case in point: her recent candidness regarding hair loss. Knowing this, we\u2019ve kept an eye out for any other beauty admissions the 46-year-old might reveal, and unsurprisingly, she delivered.\n\nWhile on her Facebook Watch talk show, Red Table Talk, Pinkett Smith revealed the one drugstore product she can\u2019t get enough of\u2014the Clean & Clear Essentials Deep Cleaning Astringent ($4). \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite products,\u201d the actress said. \u201cIt is brilliant\u2026it pulls all the stuff out, and it closes the pores as well. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nYou May Also Like: These $5 Drugstore Products Are the Secret to Catherine Zeta-Jones\u2019 Nude Lip\n\nBut that\u2019s not all Pinkett Smith recommends for keeping the skin blemish-free. She also advises allowing the skin to breathe: \u201cEven on makeup days, I try go to light. I do a lot of steam on my skin. On days off, I use hardly anything. I try to give the skin a break. Less is more.\u201d\n\nConsidering clogged pores are tough to combat, we can\u2019t help but love that a celebrity-recommended a solution that doesn\u2019t require a trip to the doctor. At less than $5, it\u2019s certainly worth a try.\n\nIt's Personal At NewBeauty, we get the most trusted information from the beauty authority delivered right to your inbox", "images": ["https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/51609-shutterstock_205692844jpg-910x667.jpg", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nb59cover-150x150.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21004701&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/serum.png", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/86078-body-lotionsjpg-910x667.jpg", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smilestory.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1572440699746061&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sewell-910x720.png", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hairlosscoronavirusstress-910x720.png", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/19227-jadapinkettsmithacnepng.png", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/concealer.png"], "top_img": "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/19227-jadapinkettsmithacnepng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Swears It", "Closes The Pores."], "canonical_link": "https://www.newbeauty.com/jada-pinkett-clean-and-clear-blackheads/", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith Beats Blackheads With This $4 Drugstore Product", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d23226", "description": "Jada Pinkett Smith swears by this $4 drugstore product for clearing out the pores.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith Beats Blackheads With This $4 Drugstore Product - NewBeauty", "description": "Jada Pinkett Smith swears by this $4 drugstore product for clearing out the pores.", "url": "https://www.newbeauty.com/jada-pinkett-clean-and-clear-blackheads/", "site_name": "NewBeauty", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/19227-jadapinkettsmithacnepng.png", "secure_url": "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/19227-jadapinkettsmithacnepng.png", "width": 1000, "height": 667}}, "article": {"tag": "jada pinkett-smith", "section": "Adult Acne", "published_time": "2018-06-15T19:24:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jada Pinkett Smith swears by this $4 drugstore product for clearing out the pores.", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith Beats Blackheads With This $4 Drugstore Product - NewBeauty", "image": "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/19227-jadapinkettsmithacnepng.png"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529090647.0, "source": "https://www.newbeauty.com", "summary": ""}
