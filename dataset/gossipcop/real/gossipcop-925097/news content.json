The couple celebrated the impending arrival of their baby girl with an activity-filled baby shower on Saturday.\n\nBurnham\u2019s friends Sarah Stidham and Kayla Evangelista hosted the shower, where everyone was invited to join in on the fun, Entertainment Tonight reports. There were traditional games, like a baby bottle chugging competition and having the couple guess who would be better at certain parenting activities, like singing lullabies. They also had one activity that was totally out of the box: The parents-to-be set up a sonogram machine so that fellow moms to be could check out their own buns in the oven.\n\nLuyendyk and Burnham met on the 22nd season of The Bachelor in 2017 and wed in Hawaii in January. \u201cI made some bad decisions but the best decision was running back to you,\u201d the reality star said before he proposed with\u2014what else?\u2014a ring from Neil Lane. \u201cI truly believe you are my soul mate. I\u2019m ready to face this life with you and all that comes with it. I love you so much. I wanted to do this in front of everyone because I want to show you that I should have done this a long time ago.\u201d\n\nThis will be their first child together. \"We're really, really excited to meet her. It's been a long time coming,\" Burnham told Entertainment Tonight. \"I've been pregnant for seven-ish months, so it's about time to get my body back and to meet our baby. We're really happy.\"", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/NKKPpBLzFRfWWSNbyz9mRb1dR3w=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cc61886ceb958741e8fa6ea__11-596315b2b9ee461db269aea2a65008a1.jpeg", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/UM4uWZb55WPK80phG41JvZN9PQA=/2400x1350/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cc61886ceb958741e8fa6ea__169-3d4c02a760d74c12a853c04ece80c7e3.jpeg", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/UM4uWZb55WPK80phG41JvZN9PQA=/2400x1350/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cc61886ceb958741e8fa6ea__169-3d4c02a760d74c12a853c04ece80c7e3.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Author"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/the-bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr-lauren-burnham-baby-shower", "title": "The Bachelor \u2019s Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham Host Baby Shower", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Former stars of The Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham, host a baby shower for their friends, complete with a sonogram machine", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "BRIDES", "sailthru.tags": "news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/the-bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr-lauren-burnham-baby-shower", "title": "The Bachelor \u2019s Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham Host Baby Shower", "description": "Former stars of The Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham, host a baby shower for their friends, complete with a sonogram machine", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/UM4uWZb55WPK80phG41JvZN9PQA=/2400x1350/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cc61886ceb958741e8fa6ea__169-3d4c02a760d74c12a853c04ece80c7e3.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "The Bachelor \u2019s Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham Host Baby Shower", "description": "Former stars of The Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham, host a baby shower for their friends, complete with a sonogram machine", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/Nh1UVD2lPoBBmTqu3g8qOd5OjOs=/2403x2403/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cc61886ceb958741e8fa6ea__11-596315b2b9ee461db269aea2a65008a1.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
