They both sported monochromatic grey outfits that looked tight, but aerodynamic as hell, and made the two moms look like straight-up TWINS.\n\nX17online\n\nGiphy\n\nBoth of their ensembles are pure spandex \u2013 down to their Yeezy sock boots. To take their kloning moment to the next level, Kim and Kylie also accessorized with Starbucks drinks and large, mirrored sunglasses. The size of the frames was surprising, considering the Kardashian-Jenner fam's affinity for tiny, Matrix-like sunglasses.\n\nX17online\n\nLater that same day, Kim wore yet another tight-fitting outfit, this time a bright red ensemble that consisted of what looks like bike shorts, a top, and silver leggings (or it's a unitard/catsuit \u2013 who even knows?), which she paired with the same sunnies and sock boots as before, as well as a tiny blue bag around her neck.\n\nHonestly, these outings seem very similar to the staged paparazzi photos that Kim took part in last year to debut Kanye's Season 6 collection, in which she ran multiple \"errands\" in full Yeezy looks. Can it be a coincidence that Kim and Kylie wore Yeezy outfits and just *happened* to be photographed together with their Starbucks orders? Or that Kim wore two all-Yeezy spandex looks in one day? (OK, that one isn't SO unusual.) Either way, seems kind of suspiciousssss. I'm onto you, Kanye!\n\nFollow Lauren on Instagram.\n\n", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=0.650xw:0.308xh;0.208xw,0.0619xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=0.650xw:0.308xh;0.208xw,0.0619xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Adhav", "Associate Fashion Editor", "I'M Cosmopolitan'S Associate Fashion Editor", "Write About Any", "All Trends", "Major Celeb Fashion Moments", "Why Wide-Leg Jeans Are Basically The Best."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/a21285599/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-twins-in-leggings/", "title": "HOLY SH*T, Kim and Kylie Look Like Twins in These Matching Skintight Leggings", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "HOLY SH*T, Kim and Kylie Look Like Twins in These Matching Skintight Leggings", "description": "There's a lot happening with these pics.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/a21285599/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-twins-in-leggings/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=0.650xw:0.308xh;0.208xw,0.0619xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-06-12 06:59:45", "published_time": "2018-06-12 06:37:00", "section": "Beauty & Style", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=0.650xw:0.308xh;0.208xw,0.0619xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner Look Like Twins in These Photos \u2013 Kylie and Kim Wear Matching Leggings, Yeezy Outfits", "description": "Kim and Kylie were twinning when they stepped out in Calabasas on Monday in matching grey leggings \u2013  and possibly teased an upcoming new Yeezy collection.", "keywords": "kylie jenner, kim kardashian, kim and kylie, yeezy season 6, yeezy, kanye west, kim and kylie twins", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.952xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Beauty & Style,style-beauty", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-12T18:37:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=0.650xw:0.308xh;0.208xw,0.0619xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-matching-leggings-02-1528823667.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.952xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "HOLY SH*T, Kim and Kylie Look Like Twins in These Matching Skintight Leggings", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528756620.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
