Weinstein was fired from his own company on Sunday, and on Monday, several prominent figures within in the industry \u2014 including some who have worked with Weinstein in the past \u2014 issued statements condemning his actions. The initial story has also developed in the four days since it was published, as Weinstein seeks to repair his public image in the wake of the allegations and several others to come forward. In an email obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Weinstein reportedly asked several prominent Hollywood executives for their support once he learned that the Weinstein Company would terminate his employment.\n\nJUST IN: Weinstein's desperate email to Hwood CEOs, moguls hours before his firing. Read to me by a disgusted (male) recipient pic.twitter.com/wQA64WcKf7 \u2014 Janice Min (@janicemin) October 9, 2017\n\nA similar report from Variety published Monday claimed that the producer tried to impede the Weinstein Company\u2019s probe into his harassment allegations, which played a role in his eventual ousting.\n\nIt was also reported that The New York Times had pursued the story surrounding Weinstein at least one other time in 2004. Former Times reporter Sharon Waxman, founder of The Wrap, scoffed at the public praise for the Times expos\u00e9, writing on her website that the newspaper had buckled to pressure from Hollywood elites and killed a story she had been working on about Weinstein\u2019s misconduct. Waxman says that she had information about a Miramax employee who had been hired solely to \u201ctake care of Weinstein\u2019s women needs,\u201d and that she had also made contact with a former Weinstein employee who had agreed to a settlement after an unwanted sexual encounter with the producer. According to Waxman, the studio mogul, who frequently advertised in the Times, put pressure on the newspaper to kill the story. Early claims that Matt Damon and Russell Crowe were also involved in attempts to rebut the story have since been denied by Damon himself, in a Deadline interview published Tuesday. Damon said that his conversation with Waxman was \u201cabout a one minute phone call\u201d concerning a piece she was writing about then-Miramax executive Fabrizio Lombardo. Waxman corroborated his story in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\nAs the Weinstein story continues to unfold, prominent figures continue to respond. We\u2019ll collect those responses in this post, which will be regularly updated as more celebrities speak out.\n\nUpdated October 13\n\nQuentin Tarantino: \u201cStunned and Heartbroken\u201d\n\nQuentin Tarantino broke his silence early Friday morning on the Weinstein allegations. In a statement shared by actress Amber Tamblyn on Twitter\u2014Tamblyn said they had a \u201clong dinner\u201d\u2014Tarantino said he was \u201cstunned and heartbroken\u201d to hear about Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior and will speak about it at greater length in a few days. \u201cI need a few more days to process my pain, emotions, anger and memory and then I will speak publicly about it,\u201d his statement read.\n\nTarantino\u2019s silence on the allegations was met with criticism, as the filmmaker has had all of his films distributed by Weinstein, beginning with 1992\u2019s Reservoir Dogs.\n\nUpdated October 12\n\nRyan Gosling: \u201cI\u2019m Deeply Disappointed in Myself for Being So Oblivious\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Blade Runner 2049 star Ryan Gosling tweeted a statement adding his \u201cvoice of support\u201d for the women speaking out against Weinstein. \u201cLike most people in Hollywood, I have worked with him and I\u2019m deeply disappointed in myself for being so oblivious to these devastating experiences of sexual harassment and abuse,\u201d Gosling said. \u201cHe is emblematic of a systematic problem. Men should stand with women and work together until there is real accountability and change.\u201d\n\nEmma Thompson Says Weinstein Is the Tip of the Iceberg\n\nIn an interview clip released Thursday by the BBC, the actress called Weinstein a \u201cpredator\u201d and said that he\u2019s at the top of the ladder in a system of \u201charassment, and belittling, and bullying.\u201d She also said that \u201cthis has been a part of our world, women\u2019s world, since time immemorial.\u201d When asked whether other men like Weinstein exist in Hollywood, she said that while other men may not have harassed women to the degree that Weinstein allegedly did, even one instance of harassment should \u201ccount.\u201d\n\nKate Beckinsale: \u201cHarvey Is an Emblem of a System That Is Sick\u201d\n\nIn a message posted to Instagram on Thursday morning, Beckinsale shared her own experience of being sexually harassed by Weinstein, detailing one incident in particular that occurred when the actress was 17 years old. Beckinsale said she repeatedly rebuffed Weinstein\u2019s advances and that he would jokingly tell people, \u201cKate lives to say no to me.\u201d \u201cLet's stop allowing our young women to be sexual cannon fodder, and let\u2019s remember that Harvey is an emblem of a system that is sick, and that we have work to do,\u201d the actress concluded.

It\u2019s unbelievable that he\u2019s been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career.\u201d\n\nCara Delevingne Details Various Incidents of Harassment by Weinstein\n\nModel and actress Cara Delevingne, who recently appeared in the Weinstein Company film Tulip Fever, released a statement Wednesday describing several incidents in which she said she was harassed by Weinstein. According to Delevingne, Weinstein called her early on in her acting career and asked whether she had slept with any of the women she was \u201cseen out with in the media.\u201d She said that Weinstein told her that if she was gay or publicly dated a woman, she would never \u201cget the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress in Hollywood.\u201d Delevingne also detailed an experience in which Weinstein invited her to his hotel room and asked her to kiss another woman in front of him. \u201cThe more we talk about it, the less power we give them,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the people who defend these men, you are part of the problem.\u201d\n\nI just received this statement from @Caradelevingne detailing her experience with Harvey Weinstein.

I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can.\u201d He went on to say that people like Weinstein think their achievements entitle them.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio: \u201cNo Excuse\u201d for Sexual Assault\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page\u2014also shared on Twitter\u2014DiCaprio, a frequent Weinstein collaborator, weighed in on the allegations, though he didn\u2019t refer to Weinstein by name. \u201cThere is no excuse for sexual harassment or sexual assault\u2014no matter who you are and no matter what profession,\u201d the actor said. \u201cI applaud the strength and courage of the women who came forward and made their voices heard.\"\n\nLindsay Lohan Supports Weinstein in Deleted Instagram Videos\n\nIn two videos posted on Instagram on Tuesday night, which have since been deleted, Lindsay Lohan came to Weinstein\u2019s defense and called for his wife, Georgina Chapman, to stay with him. On Tuesday, Chapman announced that she was separating with Weinstein in the wake of the allegations of sexual harassment and assault. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right what\u2019s going on,\u201d Lohan says in the videos. \u201cI think Georgina needs to take a stand and be there for her husband. He\u2019s never harmed me or did anything to me. We\u2019ve done several movies together. I think everyone needs to stop. I think it\u2019s wrong.

We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture \u2014 including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect \u2014 so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\u201d\n\nGretchen Mol: \u201cI Am Angry and Disgusted About Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Abuse of Power\u201d\n\nIn a guest column Tuesday for The Hollywood Reporter, actress Gretchen Mol denied what she described as \u201cslut-shaming\u201d rumors that she had a long-held transactional relationship with Weinstein. \u201cI did not exchange sexual favors with Harvey Weinstein, or anyone, for advancement in my career. I was never paid any settlement. The truth is that I have never been alone in a room with Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Mol wrote. She said that her story is not a defense of Weinstein, but a statement of fact. Mol wrote that she had heard rumors about Weinstein and other actresses years before she heard them about herself. \u201cThe consistent implication was that actresses were eager for the bargain, that we wanted fame and fortune so desperately that we would make this kind of nauseating concession. This is another kind of misogyny, and blame-shifting,\u201d Mol continued. She finished by putting her support behind the outspoken victims, proclaiming, \u201cWe have no reason to feel ashamed.\u201d\n\nHeather Graham: \u201cWe Don\u2019t Want to Be the First or Only Voice in the Room\u201d\n\nIn an account published by Variety on Tuesday afternoon, Heather Graham detailed an encounter with Weinstein in which she said he implied that she had to have sex with him for a movie role. She recounted a meeting with Weinstein in which he told her he wanted her to star in one of his movies. \u201cLater in the conversation, he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town,\u201d Graham wrote. \u201cI walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy. There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there.\u201d She went on to express her support for the other women who have shared their stories, and said, \u201cWhile I still do feel guilty for not speaking up all those years ago, I\u2019m glad for this moment of reckoning. To the countless other women who have experienced the gray areas: I believe you.\u201d\n\nMinnie Driver Speaks Out in Support of Victims\n\nFrequent Miramax star Minnie Driver condemned Weinstein\u2019s alleged abuse on Tuesday afternoon in a statement made to Variety. \u201cIn light of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein in the past few days, I feel it necessary to add my support for the women who have been victimized and have been brave enough to talk about it,\u201d Driver said in her statement. \u201cWhile I never experienced any abuse while working with Harvey, I think it\u2019s important to add my voice to those of women everywhere who have experienced abuse at the hands of powerful men.\u201d\n\nMatt Damon Denies Pressuring The New York Times to Kill a 2004 Harvey Weinstein Story\n\nIn an interview with Deadline, Damon addressed The Wrap\u2019s allegation that he, along with Russell Crowe, pressured The New York Times into killing a story about Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct. According to Damon, Weinstein told him to expect a call from Sharon Waxman about Miramax employee Fabrizio Lombardo, and that the story she was pursuing was a negative piece on Lombardo. \u201cHarvey said, \u2018You worked with him,\u2019\u201d Damon said. \u201c\u2018Can you tell her that he was a professional and you had a good experience,\u2019 and that was it. I didn\u2019t mind doing it, because that was all true.\u201d\n\nThe actor also denied knowing about Weinstein\u2019s behavior, disputing the notion that everyone in Hollywood knew about the alleged harassment. \u201cThis type of predation happens behind closed doors, and out of public view,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn\u2019t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it. And I will peel my eyes back now, farther than I ever have, to look for this type of behavior. Because we know that it happens. I feel horrible for these women and it\u2019s wonderful they have this incredible courage and are standing up now.\u201d Read Damon\u2019s full interview with Deadline here.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow Reportedly Refused Weinstein Advances: \u201cI Thought He Was Going to Fire Me\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday morning, The New York Times published an article detailing various stories from major actresses, leading with an account from Paltrow. The Shakespeare in Love (a Miramax movie) Oscar winner told the Times that at age 22, she was summoned to Weinstein\u2019s suite before shooting began on Emma. According to the interview, Weinstein placed his hands on Paltrow and suggested that they head to the bedroom for massages. \u201cI was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,\u201d Paltrow told the Times. She also said that she told Brad Pitt, her boyfriend at the time, about the incident. When he confronted Weinstein, Paltrow said that producer threatened her not to tell anyone else about the incident. \u201cI thought he was going to fire me,\u201d she said.\n\nAngelina Jolie: \u201cThis Behavior Towards Women in Any field, Any Country Is Unacceptable\u201d\n\nIn the same New York Times piece published Tuesday, the actress and director joined Paltrow and others in sharing her own story about Weinstein. \u201cI had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,\u201d Jolie told the Times in an email. \u201cThis behavior towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton Releases Statement in Support of Alleged Victims\n\nWeinstein has been a longtime donor to and fundraiser for Democratic candidates and causes, and many conservative critics called on Hillary Clinton to make a statement. She released one on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cI was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,\u201d she said. \u201cThe behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.\u201d\n\nStatement from Secretary Clinton on Harvey Weinstein: pic.twitter.com/L1l2wl9l0I \u2014 Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 10, 2017\n\nNicole Kidman: \u201cWe Need to Eradicate This Behavior\u201d\n\nIn a statement released to People on Tuesday, Kidman, a frequent Weinstein Company collaborator, put her support behind the victims of Weinstein\u2019s alleged harassment. \u201cAs I\u2019ve stated before publicly, I support and applaud all women and these women who speak out against any abuse and misuse of power \u2014 be it domestic violence or sexual harassment in the workforce,\u201d the actress said in the statement. \u201cWe need to eradicate this behavior.\u201d\n\nJulianne Moore Tweets Her Support for Women Coming Forward\n\nOn Monday morning, the actress joined the growing number of stars tweeting their support of Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. \u201cComing forward about sexual abuse and coercion is scary and women have nothing to be gained personally by doing so,\u201d Moore tweeted. She continued, \u201cBut through their bravery we move forward as a culture, and I thank them. Stand with @AshleyJudd @rosemcgowan and others.\u201d\n\n1.

This is completely unacceptable, and I find myself asking what I can do to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to others. We need to do better at protecting our sisters, friends, co-workers and daughters. We must support those who come forward, condemn this type of behavior when we see it and help ensure there are more women in positions of power.\u201d\n\nRebecca Hall: \u201cI Think He Deserves What Is Coming\u201d\n\nHall, who has appeared in a number of Weinstein Company productions, spoke with IndieWire on Tuesday about Weinstein\u2019s conduct and the recent allegations against him. \u201cOf course I have something to say about it,\u201d Hall said. \u201cHe released two films that I was involved in, so it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t come across him.\u201d She continued, \u201cI wholeheartedly stand behind the women who are coming out and saying what they\u2019re saying now, it\u2019s incredibly hard to do that, and the idea that it could be in any way for their gains is preposterous. I think what\u2019s going to happen in the next couple of days is interesting and I think he deserves what is coming. It\u2019s indefensible how he\u2019s behaved, it is. I think it\u2019s inexcusable, and I am behind those women.\u201d Hall said that while she was never personally assaulted by Weinstein, she was aware of the rumors concerning his behavior.\n\nJennifer Lawrence \u201cDeeply Disturbed\u201d by Allegations\n\nOn Monday night, Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar in 2013 for her leading role in Silver Linings Playbook\u2014a film produced by Weinstein\u2014called the allegations against the producer \u201cinexcusable and absolutely upsetting.\u201d \u201cI was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein\u2019s behavior,\u201d she said in a statement to Variety. \u201cMy heart goes out to all of the women affected by these gross actions.

I suppose the argument would be that it\u2019s not just about Hollywood, but about all of us\u2014that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don\u2019t speak up, you\u2019re complicit. And there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d Read Clooney\u2019s full interview here.\n\nJessica Chastain: Weinstein Stories \u201cWere Everywhere\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets Monday, Jessica Chastain said it was \u201cheart shattering\u201d to read Waxman\u2019s piece in The Wrap and learn that Hollywood elites reportedly made efforts to keep the Weinstein allegations silent. \u201cI was warned from the beginning,\u201d Chastain wrote in another tweet. \u201cThe stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an enviornment [sic] for it to happen again.\u201d\n\nI was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere.

Read her full response here.\n\nKate Winslet Applauds \u201cProfound Courage\u201d of Women Speaking Out Against Weinstein\n\nWinslet, who won a Best Actress Oscar in 2009 for The Reader\u2014which was released by the Weinstein Company\u2014praised the \u201cprofound courage\u201d of the women who spoke out against the mogul in a statement to Variety on Monday. \u201cI unequivocally support this level of very necessary exposure of someone who has behaved in reprehensible and disgusting ways,\u201d the actress says. \u201c[Weinstein\u2019s] behaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong. I had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been na\u00efve. And it makes me so angry.\u201d\n\nMeryl Streep: \u201cNot Everybody Knew\u201d\n\nStreep, who has collaborated with Weinstein on films like The Iron Lady, for which she won an Academy Award for best actress, sent a statement to HuffPost on Monday about the producer. Noting first that Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior is disgraceful and appalling, Streep said that Weinstein maintained a \u201crespectful\u201d working relationship with her, and emphasized that the open secret of his actions wasn\u2019t privy to everyone in Hollywood. In closing, she lauded the women who came forward for their courage in bringing Weinstein\u2019s abusive behavior to light. Her full statement reads:\n\nThe disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\n\nLena Dunham Implores Hollywood to \u201cSpeak Louder\u201d\n\nIn a Monday op-ed for The New York Times, Girls creator Dunham called for men in Hollywood to speak out against sexually inappropriate behavior, an all-too-familiar experience for women working in the industry. \u201cMr. Weinstein may be the most powerful man in Hollywood to be revealed as a predator, but he\u2019s certainly not the only one who has been allowed to run wild,\u201d Dunham writes. \u201cHis behavior, silently co-signed for decades by employees and collaborators, is a microcosm of what has been happening in Hollywood since always and of what workplace harassment looks like for women everywhere.\u201d You can read Dunham\u2019s full op-ed here.\n\nFrequent Collaborator Judi Dench Speaks Out\n\nDench, who once joked that she had a tattoo of Weinstein because of how much he had helped her career, called the allegations \u201chorrifying\u201d in a statement provided to Newsweek on Monday. \u201cWhilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offenses which are, of course, horrifying, and I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,\u201d the actress said.\n\nDirector Kevin Smith: \u201cIt Makes Me Feel Ashamed\u201d\n\nSmith, who worked with Weinstein on films at the beginning of his career, such as Dogma and Chasing Amy, admitted he was \u201cashamed\u201d to have worked with the producer after a Twitter user asked for his thoughts about the accusations.\n\nHe financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed. https://t.co/T0hInW7EqJ \u2014 KevinSmith (@ThatKevinSmith) October 9, 2017\n\nRose McGowan Calls for Weinstein Company Resignations\n\nMcGowan, who reportedly reached a settlement with Weinstein after an \u201cepisode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival\u201d in 1997, according to the Times report, spoke about the allegations on Twitter and in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cMen in Hollywood need to change ASAP,\u201d she told the Reporter. \u201cHollywood\u2019s power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behavior has not.\u201d On Twitter, McGowan said that other members of the Weinstein Company \u2014 including Weinstein\u2019s brother and company cofounder, Bob \u2014 should resign. \u201cThe men of Hollywood need to know they own no woman,\u201d she said in a statement attached to a tweet.\n\nDirector James Gunn Pens a Response\n\nIn an essay published Monday on his Facebook page titled \u201cOn Sexual Predators in Hollywood (and the World),\u201d Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn wrote about the Weinstein allegations and the larger systemic issues of sexual harassment facing women.
