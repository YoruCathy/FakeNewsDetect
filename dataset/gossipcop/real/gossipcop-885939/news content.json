That\u2019s the only word you can start with,\u201d he says. \u201cHarvey\u2019s admitted to it, and it\u2019s indefensible. I\u2019ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We\u2019ve had dinners, we\u2019ve been on location together, we\u2019ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I\u2019ve never seen any of this behavior\u2014ever.\u201d\n\nClooney spoke to me at length about the allegations\u2014as well as charges of Hollywood complicity\u2014during a phone conversation late Monday.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of statements released by Meryl Streep and Dame Judi Dench, two actresses who\u2019ve won Oscars for Weinstein-shepherded films and who took the bullying movie mogul to task for allegedly preying on vulnerable young women for 30 years, resulting in at least eight settlements, according to a bombshell New York Times expos\u00e9.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s accusers, among them the actress Ashley Judd, shared similar horror stories: a \u201cbusiness meeting\u201d at a lavish hotel suite soon gave way to a series of sexual propositions, including watching him shower. One local TV reporter, Lauren Sivan, claimed that Weinstein cornered her in the bowels of his restaurant, told her to \u201cbe quiet,\u201d and masturbated into a potted plant.\n\nWeinstein, the former co-chief of Miramax, has since been fired from The Weinstein Company\u2014which he co-founded with his brother Bob\u2014and many of the male actors and filmmakers in particular who have benefited from the studio executive\u2019s Oscar Midas touch, from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting) to Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), have remained alarmingly silent.\n\nClooney, on the other hand, was anything but.\n\nHow did you react to the Harvey Weinstein news?\n\nI\u2019ve heard rumors, and the rumors in general started back in the \u201990s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn\u2019t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we\u2019re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn\u2019t hear anything about that and I don\u2019t know anyone that did. That\u2019s a whole other level and there\u2019s no way you can reconcile that. There\u2019s nothing to say except that it\u2019s indefensible.\n\nThe thing I\u2019ve been seeing online is that, in the wake of Meryl Streep\u2019s statement, and knowing that he helped guide her to an Oscar for The Iron Lady, many people are saying, \u201cOh, she had to know.\u201d But that seems both incredibly speculative and unfair.\n\nA lot of people are doing the \u201cyou had to know\u201d thing right now, and yes, if you\u2019re asking if I knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure. But I had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence, and that these women were threatened and victimized. I\u2019ve been talking with a lot of people about this, and I don\u2019t know many people who knew of that.\n\nSharon Waxman over at The Wrap said she was working on a story about Harvey over 10 years ago at The New York Times and they killed it, and if that\u2019s true, then that\u2019s a shameful thing because a lot of women wouldn\u2019t have been made victims if this had come out. By the same token, I do want to say that Sharon\u2019s been running her own influential website, The Wrap, for quite a long time, and if she did these interviews and this investigation, she didn\u2019t run the story either, and I and a lot of other people would have liked to have known it. A good bunch of people that I know would say, \u201cYeah, Harvey\u2019s a dog\u201d or \u201cHarvey\u2019s chasing girls,\u201d but again, this is a very different kind of thing. This is harassment on a very high level. And there\u2019s an argument that everyone is complicit in it. I suppose the argument would be that it\u2019s not just about Hollywood, but about all of us\u2014that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don\u2019t speak up, you\u2019re complicit. And there\u2019s no question about that.\n\nHollywood can be good when it comes to certain progressive causes, but this area\u2014preying on women\u2014seems to be a pretty major blind spot. The \u201ccasting couch\u201d and the \u201ccreepy, lecherous producer,\u201d these are concepts that are so firmly ingrained in the industry that they\u2019ve become troubling clich\u00e9s, and go all the way back to Golden Age studio chiefs like Louis B. Mayer and David O. Selznick.\n\nI hear you. At the same time, I know an awful lot more people in this business who have nothing to do with that, and I suppose if I went looking I could probably find three or four names of people that I would suspect of doing that. The other part of it is, I\u2019d like to think that if someone came up to me and told me this was going on that I would go out and confront it. I\u2019ve told this story about a night with Silvio Berlusconi, and I hadn\u2019t told all the specifics about it before, but perhaps I should have been more graphic about how vulgar that was in a way to take some responsibility\u2014each of us, in our own individual way\u2014of talking about people with a lot of power using it and holding it over others in some ways.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe that\u2019s what good will come out of this: that not just in Hollywood, although Hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don\u2019t need to be afraid.\n\nThis is an interesting moment. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people, from Meryl [Streep] to Judi Dench, come out and say \u201choly shit,\u201d and I think that that\u2019s been the reaction by a lot of people in Hollywood. I don\u2019t think that people were looking the other way; I think that people weren\u2019t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.\n\nSo when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it\u2019s a news story. And this is a big news story now. And I feel very bad for all of the victims. I mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant? That\u2019s not just some rumor about Harvey hitting on a woman; it\u2019s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up. That\u2019s frustrating. If politicians knew these stories, I doubt they\u2019d have been taking donations from him at the DNC [Democratic National Committee], and I hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.\n\nThose on the right, from Fox News to Donald Trump Jr., have used the Harvey Weinstein news as a cudgel against liberals. It\u2019s a bit rich on Trump Jr.\u2019s part, given the numerous allegations against his father.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a little pot and kettle there, unfortunately. But I think that everything gets politicized these days. The reality is that this is a problem deeply ingrained in our society. It was something that was talked about a lot on the left with Roger Ailes, Bill O\u2019Reilly, and Donald Trump, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be talked about a lot on the right with Harvey Weinstein. I think that rather than politicize it, there should be talk on both sides about the really bad behavior by powerful men and the horrible acts they commit. It\u2019s pretty crazy to me.\n\nIt is so firmly ingrained in the culture now. We just elected a man president who\u2019s been accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women and was caught on tape bragging to a relative stranger about his ability to sexually assault women at will. One of the strange things about the Harvey news is it emerged around the one-year anniversary of that Trump Access Hollywood tape.\n\nThat is a funny part of it: In \u201cliberal\u201d Hollywood the guy loses his job, but then this other guy [Trump] gets elected president. There are a couple of good things that have to come out of this, because something good has to come out of this. One of those things is that victims have to feel safer to come out and tell their stories without the fear of losing their jobs, and they also need to be believed, which is a very important element of this. Also, this should be a shot across the bow that people in places of power cannot abuse that power, and if you do, you\u2019ll be outed publicly, shamed, and even prosecuted. When it comes to most of the people that I know, where we\u2019re shocked is by how bad it was. This is about show business but it isn\u2019t just about show business\u2014it\u2019s about everything. We need to get to a place where we can call these people out much quicker before it becomes such a deeper, long-running problem. This apparently went on for almost 30 years.\n\nPeople did know that Harvey was a terrible bully, though. It was interesting how Hollywood approached it, because he was almost treated like a caricature\u2014the angry, bellowing studio mogul. I remember there was a character on Entourage based on him. It was treated almost like a joke.\n\nThink about it this way, too: I had knock-down, drag-out fights with him over the years, but he was also making films that other studios weren\u2019t willing to make, and he was making films that everybody loved, so you just put up with certain bad behavior because you felt like, well, if he yells and screams but he gets Pulp Fiction made, who cares if he yells and screams? But it\u2019s a very different conversation when you say, it\u2019s not that he yells and screams but that he\u2019s cornering a young, scared lady in a restaurant and telling her to stand there and be quiet while he jerks off. That\u2019s a very different kind of behavior, and had that been a public thing, I think there would have been some different results. I hope there would be.\n\nWhy do you think people are holding him accountable now? I wrote a piece about how there seems to be a lot more accountability surrounding issues of sexual assault and misconduct in Hollywood, and that it\u2019s perhaps a reaction to the Cosby revelations, which served as a wake-up call for a lot of people in the entertainment media space\u2014that in covering celebrities you can\u2019t gloss over the dark details, otherwise you\u2019re mildly complicit. Also, it\u2019s so important how there are more women now in both Hollywood and newsrooms who feel empowered to speak up and hold those in power accountable.\n\nHopefully, this kind of behavior will end\u2014or become harder and harder for it to continue. What\u2019s important now is that anybody who thinks that they can get away with doing that, they now have to think: Wait, somebody can be recording this or writing a story about it. I\u2019m going to get in a lot of trouble. That\u2019s good, because we\u2019ve seen this type of behavior in politics, in Silicon Valley, and in corporate America. This is a big problem in our society, that people in power are taking advantage of people not in power\u2014particularly powerful men with young women. Maybe Cosby was the watershed moment. I think Roger Ailes was also a watershed moment, because it concerned an establishment figure up to some very shady stuff. But this isn\u2019t a right or a left issue; this is a moral issue. We\u2019re all going to have to be more diligent about it and look for any warning signs. Before, people weren\u2019t paying enough attention to it. Now we have to. This is the moment to start scaring people like this into not acting this way anymore.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1490733486/author/20170327-stern-marlow-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1507605328/171009-stern-cloone--weinstein-tease_eo0do8", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1507605328/171009-stern-cloone--weinstein-tease_eo0do8", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1507605328/171009-stern-cloone--weinstein-tease_eo0do8", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-clooney-speaks-out-on-harvey-weinstein-its-disturbing-on-a-whole-lot-of-levels", "title": "George Clooney Speaks Out on Harvey Weinstein: \u2018It\u2019s Disturbing on a Whole Lot of Levels\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "George Clooney Speaks Out on Harvey Weinstein: \u2018It\u2019s Disturbing on a Whole Lot of Levels\u2019", "keywords": "Roger Ailes, Fox News, Donald J.
