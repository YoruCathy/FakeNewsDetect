Every night that The Late Show has been on the air has been a night that Colbert has passionately slammed Trump and his staff alike for using their power to spread falsehoods and fear.\n\nThat\u2019s why seeing Colbert close out his monologue by sharing a chuckle with Spicer wasn\u2019t just jarring \u2014 it was incredibly disappointing.\n\nWith this toothless punchline, Colbert and the Emmys cast a jolly sheen over Spicer\u2019s tenure as press secretary, which began with that ridiculous lie about Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd size and continued with him berating the press for asking after the truth while evading it with all his might. It went against everything Colbert purports to do on his fiercely pointed Late Show, and retroactively sucked the air out of any biting Trump jokes he tried to make earlier in the opening monologue.\n\nAfter watching Colbert rail so hard against the Trump administration\u2019s lies, it was downright bizarre to see him warmly welcome someone responsible for defending so many of them.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673215/GettyImages_1210313196.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66651909/1201158477.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673258/GettyImages_1219080127.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utHwqcBjwya-DCI0nis3xq0iLS0=/0x0:3000x2223/1200x800/filters:focal(1809x523:2289x1003)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56723771/848630160.0.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJihGpKJKlCifV3-Um6fPoRhTOY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672824/GettyImages_491031770.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672963/GettyImages_1208286960.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673052/GettyImages_1210354251.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJihGpKJKlCifV3-Um6fPoRhTOY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Framke", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Riley Beggin", "Dylan Matthews", "Li Zhou", "Ella Nilsen", "Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/17/16324198/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-video-colbert", "title": "Stephen Colbert welcoming Sean Spicer to the Emmys stage was a disappointment and a failure", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2017-09-17T21:53:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-18T09:05:06-04:00"}, "author": "Caroline Framke", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "The host derailed his own Trump jokes by joking around with Spicer.", "og": {"description": "The host derailed his own Trump jokes by joking around with Spicer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJihGpKJKlCifV3-Um6fPoRhTOY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg", "alt": "69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards - Show", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "Stephen Colbert welcoming Sean Spicer to the Emmys stage was a disappointment and a failure", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/17/16324198/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-video-colbert"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/17/16324198/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-video-colbert", "title": "Stephen Colbert welcoming Sean Spicer to the Emmys stage was a disappointment and a failure", "description": "The host derailed his own Trump jokes by joking around with Spicer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJihGpKJKlCifV3-Um6fPoRhTOY=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg", "alt": "69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards - Show"}, "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Stephen Colbert welcoming Sean Spicer to the Emmys stage was a disappointment and a failure", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,tv,culture,latest-news,emmy-awards", "sailthru.description": "The host derailed his own Trump jokes by joking around with Spicer.", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-17T21:53:43-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v4NifmGJiNWHKEb5Bk_vmcrARdM=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56723769/848630160.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-AtM6gPudtS1A7JB-A7njP14Aw=/777x0:3000x2223/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56723769/848630160.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "emmy-awards"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505577600.0, "source": "https://www.vox.com", "summary": ""}
