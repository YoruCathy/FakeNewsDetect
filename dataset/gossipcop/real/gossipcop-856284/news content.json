On \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d she told Stephen Colbert that she had begun to feel the Trump administration may have lost some of its ability to manipulate the media.\n\n\u201cWith this trip, The Washington Post announces Friday night that there\u2019s a significant \u2018person of interest\u2019 working actively in the White House as a senior adviser to the president. And so now we\u2019re trying to figure out who the person of interest is in this F.B.I. probe who\u2019s currently working in the White House and isn\u2019t one of the people who\u2019s on the trip with him \u2014 and then mysteriously Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon got sent home early today. What are they going to be doing? I don\u2019t know but Mike Flynn\u2019s pleading the Fifth. I feel like they don\u2019t really get to make their own news anymore.\u201d \u2014 RACHEL MADDOW\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re the first president in American history who\u2019s under counterintelligence investigation by the F.B.I. and likely under a criminal obstruction of justice probe, for something that you openly committed and then bragged about to the Russians before you bragged about it on NBC News, you don\u2019t get to make your own news anymore. At this point the news of the Trump administration is the news of people investigating it and figuring out what\u2019s really going on.\u201d \u2014 RACHEL MADDOW", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-articleLarge.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-facebookJumbo.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-facebookJumbo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/television/james-corden-manchester-monologue.html", "title": "James Corden Pays Tribute to Manchester in Heartfelt Monologue", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-05-23T09:26:34.000Z", "modified": "2017-05-23T09:26:32.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/giovanni-russonello", "tag": "Jimmy Kimmel Live (TV Program)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005122756, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/d27e4d2d-591d-5ee6-8203-2a79a6ed422b", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/bf3248dc03a448768882ebb4525890ae", "description": "The \u201cLate Late Show\u201d host sent his prayers to the families affected by Monday\u2019s attack at a concert in the British city.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-facebookJumbo.png", "byl": "By Giovanni Russonello", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-thumbStandard.png", "news_keywords": "James Corden,Stephen Colbert,Rachel Maddow,Jimmy Kimmel,Seth Meyers,Conan O'Brien,Late Show with Stephen Colbert,Late Night with Seth Meyers,", "pdate": 20170523, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/television/james-corden-manchester-monologue.html", "type": "article", "title": "James Corden Pays Tribute to Manchester in Heartfelt Monologue", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-facebookJumbo.png", "alt": "James Corden saluted the people of Manchester, England, after Monday\u2019s deadly attacks there."}, "description": "The \u201cLate Late Show\u201d host sent his prayers to the families affected by Monday\u2019s attack at a concert in the British city."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/television/james-corden-manchester-monologue.html", "title": "James Corden Pays Tribute to Manchester in Heartfelt Monologue", "description": "The \u201cLate Late Show\u201d host sent his prayers to the families affected by Monday\u2019s attack at a concert in the British city.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/arts/23latenight2/23latenight1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "alt": "James Corden saluted the people of Manchester, England, after Monday\u2019s deadly attacks there."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/d27e4d2d-591d-5ee6-8203-2a79a6ed422b"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "television", "CN": "best-of-late-night", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/television/james-corden-manchester-monologue.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/d27e4d2d-591d-5ee6-8203-2a79a6ed422b", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/television/james-corden-manchester-monologue.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/arts/television/james-corden-manchester-monologue.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495468800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
