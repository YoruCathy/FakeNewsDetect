We have been that place in all the other cases, and we will be that place \u2013 as well as for the accused \u2013 on this hour.\u201d\n\nShortly before making that announcement, she discussed with NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk the difficulty of reporting on a case about someone that she interacted with on such a frequent basis.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be getting that explicit about a colleague that you worked with 24 hours ago,\u201d admitted Kelly. \u201cBut that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to report it here for you at NBC because that\u2019s our commitment to you \u2013 to bring you the truth and to do a full and fair investigation of this story as it comes to us.\u201d\n\nWatch the full clip to listen to the entire conversation between Kelly and Gosk.\n\nLauer was fired on Wednesday after NBC received \u201ca detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer.\u201d In the wake of his firing, multiple women came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Lauer. The disgraced NBC anchor released a statement on Thursday in response to the claims and his termination. \u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d Lauer said in the statement, which was read by TODAY co-host Savannah Guthrie on the show\u2019s Thursday broadcast. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.\n\n\u201cRepairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I\u2019m committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It\u2019s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F13%2Fbetter-call-saul-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2Frhbh-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fnup_180118_0041-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2F115093_46282_b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F09%2FHomeland_810_4979_R.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2F115093_48676b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2FNUP_189932_0195.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2FListen-to-Your-Heart.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2F116494_0767b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fthe-voice-rec.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Frhony.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2064'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2Fdee-rogan-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F12%2Fsnl.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F03%2Fgreys-anatomy-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Fevan-rachel-wood-aaron-paul-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fthe-challenge-b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Foutlander-sea5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2F116400_1225b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2FRVD417d_0162b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fnup_180118_0041-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Glicksman", "Seija Rankin", "Jodi Walker", "Maureen Lee Lenker", "Andy Hoglund", "Dalton Ross", "Chancellor Agard", "Samantha Highfill", "Sydney Bucksbaum", "James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/30/megyn-kelly-matt-lauer-show-invite/", "title": "Megyn Kelly invites Matt Lauer and accusers onto the show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Matt Lauer,Megyn Kelly", "news_keywords": "Matt Lauer,Megyn Kelly", "description": "During Thursday's episode of Megyn Kelly TODAY, Kelly invited the accusers and Matt Lauer onto her show.
