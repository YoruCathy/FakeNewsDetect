Erin Bell is complicated, raw and dangerous, and it was a privilege to portray her. I share this with Karyn Kusama as well as all of the cast and crew. It was truly a passion project for all of us. A huge thank you to The Hollywood Foreign Press.\"\n\nEmily Blunt, Best Actress in a Motion Picture -- Musical or Comedy for \"Mary Poppins Returns\"\n\n\"Thank you ever so much to the HFPA! I'm blown away and over the moon. I delighted in playing every aspect of this extraordinary and iconic character. The entire experience working on it was spellbinding and that's largely to do with the incomparable Rob Marshall who took on this project with great love, depth and courage in his heart. I'm thrilled for Lin and for the recognition for our beautiful score as well as the film as a whole. Thank you again.\"\n\nAntonio Banderas, Best Performance by an Actor in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for \"Genius: Picasso\"\n\n\"Thanks to the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press for this recognition that I share with the phenomenal team of great professionals that National Geographic put together to create this complicated, controversial and amazing 'Genius.' I would love also to mention my home town of M\u00e1laga, birth place of Picasso too, for its continual effort to become a referential city of culture.\"\n\nJohn David Washington, Nominee, Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture -- Drama for \"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\n\"Thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press Association, for this incredible honor and for your support of 'BlacKkKlansman.' My deepest appreciation to the legendary Spike Lee -- we stand on your shoulders, sir. Thank you to the most talented group of actors and the crew, and to Focus Features for their unwavering support. Most importantly -- Ron Stallworth, you're a hero. Thank you for allowing me to tell your story on screen. This is a surreal moment, wow.

I share this with the brilliant Jonathan Pryce, who was the only one to received a Nobel Prize for literature this year, even if it was just in a movie.... and most of all director Bjorn Runge who made my performance possible.\"\n\nSpike Lee, Best Direction -- Motion Picture, for \"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\n\"I found out about these Golden Globe Nominations for 'BLACKkKLANSMAN' in between advising my NYU Grad School students because I teach on Thursdays. The first word that came to mind was 'BOOM SHAKALAKA'. Thank you to the HFPA!\"\n\nJohn C. Reilly, Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture -- Musical or Comedy for \"Stan & Ollie\"\n\n\"I am so honored to receive this nomination from the members of the HFPA. I'm honored on behalf of Sony Classics and our entire film to be included in such an impressive group of actors but most of all, I'm so pleased to see the great Babe himself, Oliver Hardy acknowledged in this way. He's got a sweet grin on his face this morning wherever he is, just like me. Long live the eternal clowns Laurel and Hardy.\"\n\nJed Mercurio, Best Television Series -- Drama for \"Bodyguard\"\n\n\"Everyone involved in making 'Bodyguard' is immensely flattered by the series being nominated, and congratulations to Richard Madden on being recognized for his incredible performance.\"\n\nAdam McKay, Best Director -- Motion Picture and Best Screenplay for \"Vice\"\n\n\"I'm so happy for our amazing cast of 'VICE' being acknowledged with multiple nominations.

Thank you to the HFPA and also to Annapurna, Plan B and Gary Sanchez.\"\n\nJustin Hurwitz, Best Original Score -- Motion Picture for \"First Man\"\n\nThank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press. Thank you to Damien for making this beautiful film and pushing me to dig deep for the themes and moods of this score.

I'm grateful to the HFPA for recognizing the work.\"\n\nAdam Driver, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for \"BlacKkKlansman\"\n\n\"I'm very thankful to the HFPA and pretty blown away by all of this.
