The suit claimed Mr Cohen worked with Mr Trump to prevent her from making the story of the alleged affair public during the 2016 US election. It also accused Mr Cohen of continuing to try to silence her.\n\nMr Cohen, according to his own claims, paid Ms Daniels $130,000 (\u00a391,000) leading up to the 2016 election. He was quick to deny any connection to Mr Trump's campaign team, saying that he used his own money to pay her. The payment was reportedly part of a nondisclosure agreement regarding the affair, which allegedly occurred a decade ago. Mr Avenatti argued that the document is not valid because Mr Trump never signed it.\n\nMs Daniels' lawsuit alleged however, that Mr Cohen created a company \u201cwith Mr Trump\u2019s knowledge\u201d to hide the source of the payout money. She also said in the complaint that Mr Cohen implied she was lying about the nature of her relationship with Mr Trump.\n\nThe president has confirmed Mr Cohen was reimbursed for the payment.", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/24/14/stormy-daniels.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/24/14/stormy-daniels.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mythili Sampathkumar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stormy-daniels-divorce-glendon-crain-brendon-miller-husband-porn-restraining-order-a8461651.html", "title": "Stormy Daniels\u2019 husband Glendon Crain files for divorce and restraining order", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stormy-daniels-divorce-glendon-crain-brendon-miller-husband-porn-restraining-order-a8461651.html", "title": "Stormy Daniels\u2019 husband files for divorce and restraining order", "description": "Ms Daniels has alleged she had an affair with Donald Trump and has a lawsuit against his attorney Michael Cohen", "updated_time": "2018-07-24T14:56:44+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/24/14/stormy-daniels.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "description": "Stormy Daniels\u2019 husband Glendon Crain has filed for divorce in Texas after claiming infidelity.", "keywords": "Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump, Michael Avenatti, Michael Cohen, Americas, World, News", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "Stormy Daniels", "published_time": "2018-07-24T14:56:45+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-24T14:56:44+01:00", "section": "Americas", "author_name": "Mythili Sampathkumar", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 475, "image_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 10, "external_link_count": 0}, "twitter": {"title": "Stormy Daniels\u2019 husband files for divorce and restraining order", "description": "Stormy Daniels\u2019 husband Glendon Crain has filed for divorce in Texas after claiming infidelity.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532440605.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
