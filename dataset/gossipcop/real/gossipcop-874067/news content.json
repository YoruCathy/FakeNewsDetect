My heart and my love goes out to her and them all. The cast and crew send peace, healing, and their deepest condolences,\u201d she concluded her message.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Harris is thought to be the stunt double for Beetz.

It was her first job as a stuntwoman.\n\nWitnesses told the Vancouver Sun that Harris lost control of her bike during a stunt, jumped a curb and crashed through a plate-glass window at Shaw Tower. Police said she died at the scene. Deadline reported that she was not wearing a helmet during the scene because her character does not wear a helmet in the film.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan Reynolds led the Deadpool 2 crew in a moment of silence on set before they resumed filming. The actor, 40, stood at the center of the crew members, who huddled up around him and bowed their heads after he said a few words.\n\n\u201cToday, we tragically lost a member of our crew while filming Deadpool,\u201d Reynolds tweeted after the accident. \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken, shocked and devastated\u2026 but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment.
