But there was a backlash and it was one of the most hated shows. Now the show is back with Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, so fans can catch up on the stars as they go on vacation.\n\nThere is one person missing that is sorely missed. That\u2019s Sammi \u201cSweetheart\u201d Giancola, who had a volatile off-and-on relationship with Ronnie Ortiz-Magro. There are rumors as to why she turned down the opportunity but she has finally given a statement.\n\nSo why won\u2019t she be on the show (page 6) and what has the other cast members said about it? Here are seven things to know.\n\n1. Jenni \u2018JWOWW\u2019 Farley and Nicole \u2018Snooki\u2019 Polizzi said they wanted Giancola to do the show\n\nPolizzi and Farley wanted their old friend to come back on the show with them. | Rich Polk/Getty Images for MTV Polizzi and Farley wanted their old friend to come back on the show with them. | Rich Polk/Getty Images for MTV\n\nEarly on, there seemed to at least be some hope that Giancola would change her mind and appear on the show. Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley and Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi talked about hoping this would happen.\n\n\u201cIn my head, in my dreams of dreams, I really hope that [Sammi] pops in,\u201d Farley once told Us Weekly. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s gonna be different. I wish she would be on it but I understand why she\u2019s not going to be on it.\u201d\n\nPolizzi said on her podcast that multiple people tried to get Giancola to change her mind. \u201cWe\u2019re all begging her to come back on the show. It\u2019s really up to her. Everyone pray that Sammi comes back because I feel like she might change her mind.\u201d\n\nSo why isn\u2019t she doing it? Well, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro has been suspected of being part of the reason, given they used to date on the show.\n\nNext: This is what Ortiz-Magro said about the claim he\u2019s the reason she didn\u2019t come back.\n\n\n\n2.

The two had a volatile romantic relationship on the original show, so it would have been understandably awkward. But he denies this.\n\n\u201cWe started this all together and I would have loved to have finished it together because now everyone thinks it\u2019s because of me she didn\u2019t come back, but it\u2019s because she has a boyfriend,\u201d Ortiz-Magro told Us Weekly.\n\nNext: This source goes against what Ortiz-Margo said.\n\n\n\n3.

Ortiz-Margo said no matter what, Giancola will be a part of his life\n\nThey have a lot of history together. | MTV They have a lot of history together. | MTV\n\nAlthough Giancola has decided to move on Ortiz-Margo recognizes that she will always be a part of his reality TV career.\n\n\u201cNo matter what, she\u2019s always going to be \u2026 [as] you\u2019ll see in this season I say, \u2018Sam will always be a part of my life, but she doesn\u2019t have to be a part of my life.\u2019 No matter what, this will always be on the television show, [in] interviews, Sam will always be brought up,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also added, \u201cSo she\u2019ll be a part of my life, but she doesn\u2019t have to be standing next to me to be a part of my life.\u201d\n\nNext: Farley said this is why Giancola didn\u2019t do it.\n\n\n\n5.

Farley told E! News:\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to be a part of it because she\u2019s moved on with her life. For all of us, we never thought that this was coming back. We truly wanted it to come back, but we never thought that, so when the opportunity came, she\u2019s just in a different place now. And she had real-life drama in this house, so I think she just didn\u2019t want it brought up again.\n\nNext: This is Giancola\u2019s statement on her decision.\n\n\n\n6.
