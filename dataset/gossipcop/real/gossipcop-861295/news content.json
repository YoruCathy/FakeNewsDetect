According to father Nick Clooney, his face was half paralyzed for several weeks and some remnants of the disease lasted months. <P> \"It certainly affected him at the time,\" Nick Clooney said. \"But even there, George would find ways with humor to make it work for him. He would make fun of himself. He always did that. He tried to make fun of himself before others made fun of him, no matter what the disability might be.\" In this photo, his father said, George's smile is slightly crooked because of the facial paralysis. <P> There is still \"some residue of a little eye drooping\" when George gets tired, his dad said.

He also was a jock, of course. But he combined those often,\" Nick Clooney said.

The visit solidified Clooney's dream to become an actor, his dad said, <P> \"Being around them and being around the entire ambiance of making film, watching how it is done, the process of -- of making the film itself, fascinated him from the very beginning, from that day,\" Nick Clooney said. \"And I think that's what led him away from broadcasting generally and directly into film acting and filmmaking.\" <P> From left to right: Miguel Ferrer, aunt Mary Guilfoyle, Clooney, Mary McDonough and Rafi Ferrer.
