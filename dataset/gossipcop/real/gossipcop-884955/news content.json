Even as the Shondaland series heads into its fourteenth season, Grey\u2019s Anatomy has just as much drama off screen as it does on.\n\nThere are only two cast members from the original line-ups of interns still on Grey\u2019s Anatomy: the eponymous Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Given the insanely high death rate at Seattle Grace, are you really surprised that there\u2019s some wild stuff going on behind the scenes?\n\nWhy did T.R. Knight really leave the show? What scene did ABC force Shonda Rhimes to change in season 1? Which actor was the entire cast rumored to be resentful of? And did Shonda Rhimes actually kill off Derek because she didn\u2019t like him?\n\nHere are 15 Dark Behind-The-Scenes Secrets From Grey\u2019s Anatomy You Had No Idea About. Let us know which ones surprised you the most!\n\n15. Patrick Dempsey was terrified of Shonda Rhimes\n\nWhen Patrick Dempsey first met Shonda Rhimes to discuss being a part of the show, he couldn\u2019t help but notice the blank stare she gave him as everyone else in the room talked. He was completely terrified of her, and after that meeting, he said he was convinced she hated him. He was certain that it wasn\u2019t going to work, and that he wouldn\u2019t be a part of what was, at the time, an untitled drama about surgeons.\n\nLuckily for him, the blank stare and lack of warmth wasn\u2019t because Shonda Rhimes hated him. She was just trying to imagine how she could possibly write dialogue for such a \u201cdreamy\u201d actor. And thus, Derek Shepherd, aka McDreamy, was created. (That affection, according to rumors, couldn\u2019t last forever. RIP, McDreamy.)\n\n\n\n14. The network forced Shonda Rhimes to change an early scene\n\nIn the early days of Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes received a lot of criticism from ABC. Reportedly, she was told to make several changes to her writing in the first season, including a scene with Alex Karev and Cristina Yang that was originally written for episode two, \u201cThe First Cut is the Deepest\u201d. The scene was supposed to show the two of them them racing around the hospital to see who could deliver the most bad news to patients in the shortest amount of time, only to be shamed by the last patient.\n\nHowever, the network forced Rhimes to cut the scene from the episode because they felt it went too far. \u201cI think the term that was used to describe me to my face was, \u2018If you think you\u2019re funny, you\u2019re sick,'\u201d Rhimes said. \u201cI was stunned.\u201d Instead, the new version of that scene shows Alex and Cristina racing to give out good news (and avoid getting too many hugs from patients).\n\n\n\n13. Shonda Rhimes kept track of how often a network exec. cursed at her\n\nSpeaking of criticism, Shonda Rhimes has admitted to clashing with the network quite a bit in the first two seasons of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. The Alex and Cristina scene was just one incident, and Rhimes struggled with how she could continue to revise her writing without changing the show entirely.\n\nThe head of ABC at the time, Steve McPherson, apparently said some pretty nasty things to Rhimes after about the fourth or fifth episode. \u201cHe said really horrible things to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI literally started keeping a list of how many times he said a certain swear word to me. After that, I was like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re dead.'\u201d\n\nThankfully, the show wasn\u2019t dead, and instead had a strong series premiere \u2014 and is now heading into its fourteenth season.\n\n\n\n12. Meredith was supposed to date Burke, but Ellen Pompeo refused\n\nSeriously. Think about that one for a second. Can you imagine anything other than MerDer? Can you picture Meredith saying \u201cpick me, choose me, love me\u201d to anyone other than McDreamy himself? Well, things were almost very different.\n\nApparently, Shonda Rhimes wanted Meredith\u2019s love interest to be Isaiah Washington\u2019s Preston Burke rather than Patrick Dempsey\u2019s Derek Shepherd. Ellen Pompeo, however, didn\u2019t like that idea at all. Because she\u2019s in an interracial relationship in real life, she didn\u2019t want to also be in one on screen, because she felt it would \u201chit too close to home.\u201d\n\nPompeo lobbied for MerDer to be the show\u2019s big romance and instead, it was Cristina who fell for Burke, that is until he left her at the altar.\n\n\n\n11. Isaiah Washington reportedly choked Patrick Dempsey on set\n\nThere seem to be several different versions of this story, but Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey definitely admitted to getting into a heated argument on set. They were in each other\u2019s faces, yelling at each other, and one rumor has it that Washington had Dempsey by the throat. Either way, it was definitely a dramatic incident, and one that was apparently all about the work ethic on set.\n\nThe good news is that no one was hurt, and later, it\u2019s said that the two were back to work with no problems. When Washington talked about the incident after that, he laughed that he had been so close to Dempsey that he could appreciate how blue his eyes were. Well, that\u2019s nice!\n\n\n\n10. Isaiah Washington used a homophobic slur and was fired\n\nSpeaking of the fight between Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey, Washington used a homophobic slur at some point in that exchange, and T.R. Knight, who played George O\u2019Malley on the show, apparently felt that slur was directed at him. Now, since then, Knight has come out as a gay man, but at the time, that wasn\u2019t case.\n\nWashington apologized for using the word later, saying, \u201cI can neither defend nor explain my behavior,\u201d Washington said in a statement. \u201cI can also no longer deny to myself that there are issues I obviously need to examine within my own soul, and I\u2019ve asked for help.\u201d\n\nStill, he managed to use the word yet again and ultimately get himself fired from Grey\u2019s Anatomy. So it\u2019s no surprise that his guest appearance in season 10 was met with some controversy.\n\n\n\n9. Katherine Heigl dissed the show\u2019s writing\n\nThis one is pretty darn unbelievable. After having won the Emmy award for supporting actress on Grey\u2019s Anatomy the year before, Katherine Heigl opted to remove her name from Emmy consideration in 2008. \u201cI did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization, I withdrew my name from contention,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials.\u201d\n\nSurprising? Maybe not so much. Shonda Rhimes later opened up about the incident, saying, \u201cOn some level it stung, and on some level I was not surprised,\u201d and \u201cWhen people show you who they are, believe them.\u201d\n\n\n\n8. Why T.R. Knight left the show\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy has became known for killing off beloved characters and ripping our hearts out, and that trend started with the character of George O\u2019Malley, who was tragically hit by a bus at the end of season 5. The real reason George was so tragically killed off? Because T.R. Knight decided he was ready to quit the show altogether.\n\nThe actor was reportedly unhappy that he wasn\u2019t getting enough screen time. He also noted there was a \u201cbreakdown of communication\u201d between himself and Shonda Rhimes, and he felt he no longer understood his character. Weirdly enough, George had enlisted in the military, which seemed like Rhimes\u2019 way of writing him off the show with an opening to return\u2013 until he was brutally struck by a bus.\n\nKnight actually made a recent return to Shondaland, though, appearing as Alice\u2019s brother, Tommy, on The Catch.\n\n\n\n7. The cast reportedly resented Kate Walsh for getting her own spin off.\n\nFans of Kate Walsh\u2019s Addison Montgomery had to be thrilled about a spinoff revolving around the character, Private Practice. But the rest of the Grey\u2019s Anatomy cast? Yeah, not so much.\n\nThe cast was rumored to be resentful of Kate Walsh for getting her own spin off, and they reportedly all gave her the cold shoulder once they heard the news. According to a source, \u201cThe rest of the cast seemed instantly resentful of (Walsh).\u201d The source also stated that, \u201cThey each thought they\u2019d be the one chosen to get their own show, and now they\u2019re giving Kate the cold shoulder.\u201d And reportedly, Ellen Pompeo \u201cseemed particularly peeved because she felt that, as the star, she should have been consulted.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. Why Erica Hahn was abruptly written off\n\nErica Hahn\u2019s exit certainly didn\u2019t offer any closure. She walked off to her car at the end of a shift, and that was that. We never saw her again. And in real life, the exit was nearly as abrupt.\n\nBrooke Smith she got the news that she was being let go, she was told the upcoming episode was her last. That was that. Smith said she got the feeling that it wasn\u2019t Rhimes\u2019 decision. It\u2019s also rumored that the network was uncomfortable with the explicit nature of Erica and Callie\u2019s relationship, though Rhimes later stated it wasn\u2019t that at all: \u201cBrooke Smith was obviously not fired for playing a lesbian. Clearly it\u2019s not an issue as we have a lesbian character on the show \u2013 Calliope Torres. Sara Ramirez is an incredible comedic and dramatic actress and we wanted to be able to play up her magic. Unfortunately, we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke\u2019s character would sustain in the long run.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. Shonda Rhimes: \u201cNo Heigls\u201d\n\nShonda Rhimes isn\u2019t someone you should mess around with. The showrunner has made it clear that after all the drama surrounding Grey\u2019s Anatomy, including the Emmys disaster involving Katherine Heigl, she\u2019s no longer going to tolerate anything of the sort.\n\nWhen she was discussing her new show at the time, Scandal, starring Kerry Washington, Rhimes was very clear about her stance on on-set drama: \u201cI don\u2019t put up with bulls\u2013t or nasty people. I don\u2019t have time for it,\u201d she said. She also added, very specifically, \u201cThere are no Heigls in this situation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Scandal main cast member Columbus Short (Harrison Wright) was let go from the show after drama in his personal life.\n\n\n\n4. Fans started a petition to have Jesse Williams fired\n\nAfter accepting BET\u2019s Humanitarian Award in 2016, Jesse Williams gave an impassioned and inspiring speech about racism in our nation. That speech went viral, and it was also met with quite a bit of controversy. In fact, it was met with so much controversy that some fans started a petition to have Williams fired from Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nThe Change.org petition got 28,000 signatures, and stated that Williams\u2019 speech was \u201ca racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people.\u201d It also called for fans to boycott ABC. The petition was never going to go anywhere, though, and Shonda Rhimes was quick to let people know it. She offered a simple Tweet that summed everything up, saying, \u201cUm, people? Boo don\u2019t need a petition. #Shondalandrules\u201d\n\n\n\n3. Surgery on set is gross\n\nSurgery on Grey\u2019s Anatomy is always difficult to watch, at least if you\u2019re a relatively squeamish person. Well, here\u2019s something to make it worse. Those surgeries are made to look realistic, and super gross, because of what\u2019s actually being used.\n\nA few examples? The show has been known to use cow organs and lamb brains, for starters. And for blood matter, they use a mixture of blood, chicken fat, and\u2026 Jello.\n\nSarah Drew, who plays April Kepner on the show, has even spoken out about how disgusting it is to work those things on set. In an interview, she stated, \u201cWe work with Bovine organs, which is cow\u2019s organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag. And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There\u2019s also a lot of silicone and blood matter \u2013 red jello mixed with blood and chicken fat. It\u2019s pretty gross.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. Katherine Heigl wants to return, but Shonda Rhimes shut it down\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping for Izzy Stevens to return to Grey\u2019s Anatomy at some point, you might have to keep waiting. In 2012, long after Katherine Heigl left the series, she admitted she had made mistakes and that she\u2019d like to be able to return Grey\u2019s Anatomy and wear her scrubs once again. However, Shonda Rhimes stated that wouldn\u2019t be happening any time soon.\n\nRhimes said in an interview, \u201cI think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. We are on a track we have been planning, and the idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now.\u201d\n\nHowever, anything could happen. There\u2019s a reason Rhimes didn\u2019t kill Izzie off, and in a different interview, Rhimes noted that she could be open to seeing Izzie again.\n\n\n\n1. Why Derek Was Killed Off\n\nOf all the characters to be killed off on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, this one remains the most shocking and arguably the most heartbreaking. Who would have thought we\u2019d see the day when Patrick Dempsey\u2019s Derek Shepherd was no longer a part of the series?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of speculation as to why Dempsey left Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and Shonda Rhimes admitted to killing off at least one character because she didn\u2019t like the actor who played them. Now, she didn\u2019t admit to who, but considering the timing of that admission, along with multiple rumors, it\u2019s easy to assume she was referring to Patrick Dempsey in that statement.\n\nDempsey\u2019s response? He said he believes Shonda Rhimes \u201cloves being provocative and that\u2019s fine for who she is.\u201d Talk about passive aggressive!\n\n\u2014\n\nWhich of these behind-the-secrets from Grey\u2019s Anatomy surprises you the most?
