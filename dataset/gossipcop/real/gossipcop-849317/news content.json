She was even living with him, having signed his 75-page cohabitation agreement that forces her to move out all her belongings \u201cas soon as possible\u201d upon their separation.\n\nBut Bella was still hiding her past nuptials. And it turns out, it was not just from Cena.\n\nDuring an emotional sit-down captured on camera, Bella told her family about her wedding for the first time \u2014 explaining to mom Kathy Colace, brother JJ Garcia and twin sister Brie (among others) that she was ashamed of her decision.\n\n\u201cI got married when I was 20. And got divorced at 23, to my high school sweetheart,\u201d Bella said. \u201cBasically we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it.\u201d\n\nThe union was something Bella regretted from the beginning. \u201cEven when I started walking down the aisle, I knew this was a huge mistake and how can I get out of it and I couldn\u2019t,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI tried to forget about it but now it\u2019s starting to come up, and I figured you guys have to hear from me before you hear from anyone else. It\u2019s crazy \u2019cause John doesn\u2019t even know and here we talk about marriage and we never bring it up.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I\u2019d be pissed for him if you hadn\u2019t told him. \u2018Cause you talk about marriage all the time with him, don\u2019t expect it to be easy,\u201d Garcia said. \u201c[These things] really don\u2019t just happen. You don\u2019t just run off and get married and not tell your family for 10 years. That doesn\u2019t just happen. You do what you got to do and I hope you figure it all out with John.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nIt was Garcia who would accidentally spill the beans about the secret nuptial to Cena first, mentioning it at sister Brie\u2019s 2014 wedding to her husband Daniel Bryan.\n\n\u201cI heard you\u2019re handling everything awesome,\u201d he told Cena. \u201cFor her to tell you that she\u2019s been married before and you had no problem with it, I have to give you kudos man.\n\nCena look flabbergasted but kept the conversation moving.\n\nLater, Bella finally got the courage to say something to Cena herself.\n\nLuckily, having gone through a divorce (to ex-wife Elizabeth Huberdeau in 2012 after three years of marriage), Cena was more understanding than anything. Still, as the two had been fighting about marriage \u2014 with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again \u2014 he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him.\n\n\u201cWhen the focus of most of our problems has to do with that particular topic, maybe I should know that stuff,\u201d he told Bella. \u201cI know how you feel. You\u2019re a human being, so I know you want certain things. But I would especially know how you feel about it because you had a bad experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Cena added. \u201cWhat you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don\u2019t need to know everything about you. It\u2019s just when you can tell other people and I kind of would like to be on that totem pole somewhere \u2014 I don\u2019t have to be at the top \u2026 I just would like to be on it.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gary Miller/FilmMagic\n\nBella look relieved, though she said she did \u201cfeel bad\u201d she didn\u2019t tell Cena.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve realized that I need to start having confidence in my relationship with John and that he accepts me for all my faults,\u201d she told the camera. \u201cI am so relieved that John and I have made up and I\u2019m just happy to be here with my family\u2026 honestly, nothing can go wrong now. Everything is perfect.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella End Engagement Weeks Before Destination Wedding\n\nCena and Nikki announced that they called off their engagement Sunday, a year after he proposed during WrestleMania 33.\n\nThe couple, who were together for six years, were supposed to marry May 5 during their planned destination wedding.\n\nAn insider previously told PEOPLE she was the one who pulled the plug on their wedding.\n\n\u201cJohn acted more and more like he was doing her a favor by somehow conceding to go ahead and marry her,\u201d the insider said. \u201c[Nikki] doesn\u2019t need a pity proposal, a pity wedding, a pity husband.
