With him being a no-show, fellow pro dancer Alan Bersten had to fill in as Vanessa's partner.\n\nThe 37-year-old would, later on, take to Twitter to apologize to his dance partner saying: \"As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my actions and want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!\"\n\nIt was reported that the cause of their so-called feud was their clashing personalities. Apparently, the \"DWTS\" pair did not have chemistry outside the dance floor. However, the two were since captured together giving each other a warm hug after their dance rehearsals which may have been a sign that they're finally able to work out their issues.\n\nMaks' return was an emotional one not because of their issues but because of the theme of the episode. With the theme \"My Most Memorable Year,\" Vanessa had chosen 2017 as her most memorable year mainly because of the birth of her third child, Phoenix Robert, who was just 29 weeks when he came out.\n\nVanessa recalled how at the time she was taken into emergency surgery and all she could think of was the safety of her unborn child. Nick Lachey, Vanessa's husband who is also competing on the show with Maks' wife Peta Murgatroyd, remembered feeling helpless at the time. \"I think as a man, you want to believe you can protect your kids. Protect your wife. I never felt so helpless. There was nothing I could do,\" he says.\n\nMaks and Vanessa danced the Rumba to one of Nick's songs, citing it as the song that helped their family develop a closer bond.", "images": ["https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/241_a_120_80.jpg?0164455001587057137", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236366_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236331_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236334_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236324_a_963_642_7_7.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236345_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/20/25/202514.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236281_a_130_72_7_7.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236319_a_130_72.png", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/260_a_120_80.jpg?0162822001587057137", "https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/cp.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236275_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236312_a_66_66.jpg", "https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236362_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236345_a_130_72_7_7.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236299_a_130_72_7_7.png", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236327_a_130_72.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236304_a_130_72.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236365_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/62/236251_a_66_66.jpeg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/image/11/87/118799_w_760_506.jpg", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/235_a_120_80.jpg?0165173001587057137", "https://offercdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/0/02/245_a_120_80.jpg?0163733001587057137", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/thumbnail/23/63/236337_a_130_72.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/20/25/202514.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.christianpost.com/trends/maksim-chmerkovskiy-returns-to-dancing-with-the-stars-with-an-emotional-performance-with-vanessa-lachey.html", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Returns to 'Dancing With the Stars' With an Emotional Performance With Vanessa Lachey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "2770D3F1DEB25A5BF965224150B525F4", "google-site-verification": "jUJZk866mtO5Gxkt7Qz98Q6XIzxevyn3ngdiSJLpP34", "keywords": "maksim chmerkovskiy,maks,vanessa lachey,dancing with the stars,feud,return,dwts", "description": "It lools like Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey have gone past their reported feud as the pro dancer returns to \"Dancing With The Stars.\"", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 1879686555693183, "pages": 41093998634}, "og": {"url": "https://www.christianpost.com/trends/maksim-chmerkovskiy-returns-to-dancing-with-the-stars-with-an-emotional-performance-with-vanessa-lachey.html", "type": "website", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Returns to 'Dancing With the Stars' With an Emotional Performance With Vanessa Lachey", "description": "It lools like Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey have gone past their reported feud as the pro dancer returns to \"Dancing With The Stars.\"", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/20/25/202514.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost", "creator": "@ChristianPost", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Returns to 'Dancing With the Stars' With an Emotional Performance With Vanessa Lachey", "description": "It lools like Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey have gone past their reported feud as the pro dancer returns to", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/20/25/202514.jpg"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs0D8aazPc4"], "publish_date": 1507651200.0, "source": "https://www.christianpost.com", "summary": ""}
