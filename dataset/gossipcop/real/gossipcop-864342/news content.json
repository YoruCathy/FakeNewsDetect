We didn\u2019t realize who it was at first, but after we realized it was Amy Schumer, we of course said yes,\u201d Georgio exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cThey wanted to do the same pose as us and the one picture we took came great. [Our photographer Bo] only took one because he said people jump in those pictures all the time and he didn\u2019t realize it was Amy. He\u2019s a huge fan so he was shocked when we told him who it was.\u201d\n\nGeorgio shared the sweet snapshot via Instagram on Wednesday, October 17, writing, \u201cSneak peak of the engagement shoot, special shout-out to @amyschumer and her husband Chris for making today so much fun!!\u201d\n\nUs Weekly broke the news in February that Schumer and Fischer secretly tied the knot after three months of dating. The I Feel Pretty star gushed over the cookbook author, 38, on the SiriusXM showYou Up With Nikki Glaser weeks after their nuptials. \u201cIt feels f\u2014king good!\u201d she said of married life. \u201cI\u2019m wife as hell. But it\u2019s still, like, a novelty.\u201d\n\nDuring a Today show appearance in April, Schumer revealed that she knew Fischer was \u201cthe one\u201d for her just one month after they started dating.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/photobomb.jpg?crop=0px%2C773px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/photobomb.jpg?crop=0px%2C758px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/photobomb.jpg?crop=0px%2C758px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amy-schumer-photobombs-couples-engagement-shoot/", "title": "Amy Schumer Photobombs Couple\u2019s Engagement Shoot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Amy Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, made a New York couple\u2019s day when they crashed their engagement shoot \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amy Schumer, Husband Chris Fischer Photobomb Couple\u2019s Engagement Shoot", "description": "Amy Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, made a New York couple\u2019s day when they crashed their engagement shoot \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amy-schumer-photobombs-couples-engagement-shoot/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-10-18T23:47:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/photobomb.jpg?crop=0px%2C758px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/photobomb.jpg?crop=0px%2C758px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-10-18T23:44:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-18T23:47:30+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amy Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, made a New York couple\u2019s day when they crashed their engagement shoot \u2014 get the details", "title": "Amy Schumer, Husband Chris Fischer Photobomb Couple\u2019s Engagement Shoot", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/photobomb.jpg?crop=0px%2C758px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539906248.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
