Jersey Shore star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Jen Harley got close on July 4, nine days after she was arrested for alleged domestic battery.\n\nOrtiz-Magro shared a photo on Instagram Stories of himself and Harley snuggled close with flag-themed hearts floating around them as she made a kissy face at the camera. \u201cHappy independence day,\u201d he wrote on the July 4 pic.\n\nThe on-off couple, who split (again) in June, have been making headlines in recent weeks. Harley, 31, was arrested on June 25 after allegedly hitting the 32-year-old Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star as they headed home from a Las Vegas barbecue together.\n\nA source told Us Weekly exclusively at the time that the exes, who welcomed daughter Ariana Sky in April, were arguing in the car when Ortiz-Magro asked Harley to stop the vehicle so he could get out. As he was exiting, he got caught in his seatbelt. \u201cJen started driving away, dragging Ronnie,\u201d the source said. \u201cRonnie\u2019s face was bloodied and bruised, and he\u2019s got a nasty road rash.\u201d\n\nHarley won\u2019t be facing charges from the arrest. \u201cDue to insufficient evidence,\u201d the case will not be moving forward, a Clark County District Attorney\u2019s Office spokesperson told Us on July 3.\n\nPrior to the alleged incident, Harley and Ortiz-Magro had insulted each other on social media, accused each other of cheating, and appeared to get into a physical altercation on Instagram Live before they broke up.\n\nThough Ortiz-Magro\u2019s relationship with Harley has been rocky, the MTV personality has gushed about the baby girl he shares with her, often posting adorable photos of Ariana Sky on social media. And after the apparent Instagram fight, he told Us: \u201cI remain focused on my daughter and she is my No. 1 priority.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ronnie-magro-jen-harly-back-together.jpg?w=173", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ronnie-magro-jen-harly-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C755px%2C1242px%2C651px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ronnie-magro-jen-harly-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C755px%2C1242px%2C651px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Chan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ronnie-ortiz-magro-jen-harley-celebrate-july-4-together-after-arrest/", "title": "Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Jen Harley Celebrate July 4 Together After Arrest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "'Jersey Shore' star Ronnie Rotiz-Magro and ex-girlfriend Jen Harley got cozy on July 4, nine days after her arrest for alleged domestic violence \u2014 see the pic", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Jen Harley Celebrate July 4 Together After Drama", "description": "'Jersey Shore' star Ronnie Rotiz-Magro and ex-girlfriend Jen Harley got cozy on July 4, nine days after her arrest for alleged domestic violence \u2014 see the pic", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ronnie-ortiz-magro-jen-harley-celebrate-july-4-together-after-arrest/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ronnie-magro-jen-harly-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C755px%2C1242px%2C651px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ronnie-magro-jen-harly-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C755px%2C1242px%2C651px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-04T17:09:10+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Jersey Shore' star Ronnie Rotiz-Magro and ex-girlfriend Jen Harley got cozy on July 4, nine days after her arrest for alleged domestic violence \u2014 see the pic", "title": "Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, Jen Harley Celebrate July 4 Together After Drama", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ronnie-magro-jen-harly-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C755px%2C1242px%2C651px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@anna_banana"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530724150.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
