And I commit myself to doing this.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief opening greeting in Hebrew, William added: \u201cIsrael\u2019s remarkable story is partly one of remembering its terrible past but also looking forward to a much more hopeful future ... the modern story is one of inventing, creating, innovating and striding confidently into its future.\u201d\n\nEarlier in Jerusalem, he met Netanyahu and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. On Wednesday he will meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.\n\nFollowing his engagements in Jerusalem, William went to Tel Aviv and, sporting sunglasses and an open-necked shirt, strolled along the Mediterranean shore, chatting with beach-goers and quipping, \u201cI should have brought my swimming trunks\u201d.\n\nWilliam\u2019s trip is at the behest of the British government. Until now it had been British policy not to make an official royal visit until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was resolved. British officials have given no detailed explanation for the change in policy.\n\nYAD VASHEM\n\nAt Yad Vashem, he met descendants of Jews hidden from the Nazis by his great-grandmother. Wearing a black skullcap, William laid a wreath at Yad Vashem\u2019s Hall of Remembrance, where an eternal flame flickers and the names of extermination and concentration camps are engraved in the floor.\n\n\u201cTerrifying,\u201d William said, viewing a display at the memorial\u2019s museum of shoes taken by the Nazis from Jews at Majdanek death camp. \u201c(I\u2019m) trying to comprehend the scale.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of Jews and other victims were killed at the camp, near Lublin in what is now Poland.\n\nAfter the tour, the prince - second in line to the British throne - was greeted by Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, at their official residence against the backdrop of British and Israeli flags.\n\nThere, the prince met relatives of the late Rachel Cohen, who was hidden from the Gestapo, along with two of her five children, by Princess Alice, the mother of Britain\u2019s 97-year-old Prince Philip, in her palace in Greece.\n\nBritain's Prince William speaks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara during a meeting at the prime minister\u2019s residence in Jerusalem, June 26, 2018. Thomas Coex/Pool via Reuters\n\nThe Greek royal family - Princess Alice was married to Prince Andrew of Greece - had been acquainted with Cohen\u2019s late husband, Haimaki, a former member of Greece\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cYou must be very proud of your great-grandmother, who saved defenseless Jews,\u201d Netanyahu told William.\n\nPrincess Alice was recognized as one of the \u201crighteous among nations\u201d, gentiles who rescued Jews, by Yad Vashem in 1993. A devout Christian, she is buried on the slopes of Jerusalem\u2019s Mount of Olives. William is due to visit her tomb on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, after seeing Abbas, William is scheduled to meet Palestinian youngsters.\n\nAt a meeting with Rivlin, the prince, on a visit described by Britain as non-political, said he hoped \u201cpeace in the area can be achieved\u201d. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.\n\n\u201cI had a very moving tour around Yad Vashem this morning, which really taught me quite a lot more than I thought I already knew about the true horrors of what happened to the Jews\n\nover the war,\u201d William said at the meeting with Rivlin.\n\nThe prince also spoke at Yad Vashem with two men who survived the Nazi genocide through British intervention.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nHenry Foner, 86, and Paul Alexander, 80, were among thousands of Jewish children taken in by Britain as part of the 1930s \u201cKindertransport\u201d from a continental Europe that was falling to German conquest.\n\n\u201cI said to his Royal Highness that this is a unique opportunity for me to express my thanks to the British people for opening their homes to me and to the other 10,000 children who came,\u201d Alexander said.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/CKB-22938-b44/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png",
