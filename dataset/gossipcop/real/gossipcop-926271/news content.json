The whole sordid thing. Up front. That way the members of the community here who want the season spoiled for them can watch ahead, and then protect the rest of the community, and help to distinguish between what\u2019s \u2018theory\u2019 and what\u2019s spoiler.\u201d\n\nThe requirement: 1,000 \u201cupvotes\u201d \u2014 Reddit currency for popular posts.\n\nThis proposition came in the wake of the previous season, and preceding the final season, of HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones, a show that has become a flashpoint when it comes to spoilers and how they affect television. Both Westworld and Game of Thrones have massive and engaged fan followings who dissect every aspect of the show (including but not limited to their source material, episode and script leaks, theories, rumors, actor contracts, set photographs, etc.), which then become spoiler fodder; as the post puts it, \u201c\u2018Theories can actually be spoilers, and the line between the two is confusing.\u201d And for some fans, these theories/spoilers can break the viewing experience.\n\nWhat Nolan and Joy were suggesting was a sort of radical transparency that serves to distinguish online theories from actual spoilers, with the (perhaps idealistic) notion that those who want to be spoiled can learn what happens and then \u201cprotect\u201d the larger fan community with their knowledge of what\u2019s an actual spoiler.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new age, and a new world in terms of the relationship between the folks making shows and the community watching them,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd trust is a big part of that. We\u2019ve made our cast part of this decision, and they\u2019re fully supportive. We\u2019re so excited to be in this with you guys together.\u201d\n\nGiven the heightened response that often accompanies spoiler discussions, this was a bold move; it could also have been a troll-y one, given that Nolan has said in the recent past that he and the Westworld team \u201clove to fuck with Reddit.\u201d Nothing bound Nolan and Joy to making good on their word \u2014 or from releasing a video that amounted to a red herring or a Rickroll \u2014 though given HBO\u2019s history with leaks surrounding its high-profile series, it\u2019s unlikely the network would let the Westworld team go rogue in this regard.\n\n\u201cThis is an initiative from the Westworld showrunners. We suggest you stay tuned to Reddit for their next move,\u201d HBO responded in a statement to Vox.\n\nThe post surpassed the 1,000-upvote count overnight on Monday, and Nolan and Joy made good on their word and released a video \u2014 an elaborate Rickroll:\n\nSpoiler-seeking fans might be disappointed. Although they didn\u2019t end up spoiling the show as promised, one thing is certain: Nolan and Joy found a way to get fans buzzing ahead of Westworld\u2019s return.\n\nHere\u2019s Nolan\u2019s full post (and its votes):", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672267/GettyImages_1210300377.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wl1lE607FXG_XXlS6Fc-lxellSU=/0x0:2250x1178/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7209739/westworldthandie.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671059/GettyImages_1210050360.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66563937/GettyImages_1129912168.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671897/shel_silverstein.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672372/GettyImages_1210313287.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672024/1218646346.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O7yNmBi6XcIm04h8f9MCXh08hUE=/0x0:2250x1500/1200x800/filters:focal(960x219:1320x579)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59328143/westworldthandie.0.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wl1lE607FXG_XXlS6Fc-lxellSU=/0x0:2250x1178/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7209739/westworldthandie.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Abad-Santos", "Riley Beggin", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Matthew Yglesias", "Constance Grady", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Jag Bhalla", "Apr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17216764/westworld-season-2-spoilers-reddit", "title": "Westworld\u2019s creators offered to spoil season 2 in exchange for 1,000 Reddit upvotes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2018-04-09T18:30:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-10T09:55:46-04:00"}, "author": "Alex Abad-Santos", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Westworld\u2019s creators promised to release a video spoiling season two if they found enough support.", "og": {"description": "Spoiler: They just trolled Reddit.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wl1lE607FXG_XXlS6Fc-lxellSU=/0x0:2250x1178/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7209739/westworldthandie.0.jpg", "alt": "Westworld", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "Westworld\u2019s creators offered to spoil season 2 in exchange for 1,000 Reddit upvotes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17216764/westworld-season-2-spoilers-reddit"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17216764/westworld-season-2-spoilers-reddit", "title": "Westworld\u2019s creators offered to spoil season 2 in exchange for 1,000 Reddit upvotes", "description": "Spoiler: They just trolled Reddit.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXRQFnN-XIZ0AHoqeMqZ6ZXEwkQ=/0x0:2250x1125/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7209739/westworldthandie.0.jpg", "alt": "Westworld"}, "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Westworld\u2019s creators offered to spoil season 2 in exchange for 1,000 Reddit upvotes", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,culture,latest-news,internet-culture", "sailthru.description": "Westworld\u2019s creators promised to release a video spoiling season two if they found enough support.", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-09T18:30:02-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wr4Wq4xDhlymn9Szh5NdADZOGX0=/0x0:2250x1266/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59328141/westworldthandie.0.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkeY22Xe2HX6XwVW_9LIRNdm-IQ=/390x0:1890x1500/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59328141/westworldthandie.0.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "latest-news"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7oeROkyPgs?rel=0&"], "publish_date": 1523203200.0, "source": "https://www.vox.com", "summary": ""}
