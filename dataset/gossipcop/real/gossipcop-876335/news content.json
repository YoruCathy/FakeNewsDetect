During tonight\u2019s episode of MTV\u2019s Fashion Police Video Music Awards special, the rapper joins several other hosts, including Brad Goreski, NeNe Leakes, Margaret Cho, Melissa Rivers, as well as Giuliana Rancic. On the show, the respective hosts discuss the red carpet styles for the prestigious event.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion, no one is ever safe from being ripped apart by critics.\n\nThis indeed proved to be the case with the supermodel, Alessandra Ambrosio, who\u2019s outfit was something totally out of this world.\n\nAnd while we didn\u2019t think her look was too bad, considering it shows how bold she is, the hosts of the MTV show were not quite as nice.\n\nReality star NeNe Leakes was one of the people who was just not feeling the outfit one bit.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt may all match, but this doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d\n\nThe star said she could \u201crock it,\u201d but Alessandra doesn\u2019t, unfortunately.\n\nOuch!\n\nNeNe went on to say, \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say, but she can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\n?\u26a1\ufe0f M T V \u26a1\ufe0f? @vmas A post shared by Alessandra Ambrosio (@alessandraambrosio) on Aug 27, 2017 at 7:55pm PDT\n\nBrad was also vocal in his critique of the ensemble.\n\nThe host claimed it was not a \u201c$5,500 well spent.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was a \u201cmess, a mess.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, French Montana came in with a critique that was off-the-wall, to say the least.\n\nThe Morrocan-American rapper said it wasn\u2019t \u201ceasy access.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMargaret Cho said, \u201cwell, it might be crotch-less, you don\u2019t know.\u201d French responded with a hearty, \u201cI like your style!\u201d That\u2019s a bit raunchy is it not?
