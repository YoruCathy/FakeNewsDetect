The actress, who previously worked with the disgraced mogul on the film Silver Linings Playbook, has continually been dragged into stories about his fall from grace\u2014most recently when Weinstein\u2019s legal team used an old quote from Lawrence to defend the producer\u2019s character in court. (In case you forgot: he\u2019s been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women but denies all claims of nonconsensual acts.) Lawrence\u2019s press tour for Red Sparrow has, as a result, doubled as a Distance Yourself from Weinstein Tour. She talked about him on 60 Minutes, she talked about him with Oprah, and now she\u2019s talking about him on Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show.\n\nIn a Monday night interview\u2014after Colbert provided her with a few rounds of rum (a bit he\u2019s done before with stars like Dakota Johnson)\u2014the actress excoriated Weinstein\u2019s team for using her words without her permission: \u201cHe is just that horrible ass boil that does not go away,\u201d she declared. \u201cYou pop the ass boil. He\u2019s just the worst. When is it gonna end?\u201d\n\nThe Academy Award winner explained that she was deep in the throes of her Red Sparrow press tour when she caught wind of what Weinstein\u2019s legal team was doing.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the night, I had to come up with a statement in London,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, it\u2019s still not over?\u201d\n\nNope, it\u2019s still not over\u2014and it won\u2019t be over for quite some time, considering how many legal snafus Weinstein has waded into since the scandal broke last October. Still, \u201chorrible ass boil\u201d is an entertaining entry to Lawrence\u2019s oeuvre of Weinstein disses. In her 60 Minutes interview, she was a touch more visceral.\n\n\u201cWhat he did is criminal and deplorable,\u201d she said of the allegations. \u201cAnd when it came out and I heard about it, I wanted to kill him. The way that he destroyed so many women\u2019s lives. I want to see him in jail.\u201d\n\nRed Sparrow hits theaters this Friday\u2014so savor the few days we have left of Lawrence\u2019s publicity-tour jabs.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9489051d14714f6de44038/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-on-phantom-thread.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f73c0f45451fecd45d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f83c0f45451fecd45f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd9221d14714f6de43f70/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f83c0f45451fecd45f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f70acfa84d3c08ca2b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss03.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta", "Yohana Dest", "Krista Smit", "Inez", "Jessica Dieh", "Erika Harwoo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-harvey-weinstein-horrible-boil", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Harvey Weinstein Is a \u201cHorrible Ass Boil\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "\u201cHe is just that horrible ass boil that does not go away.\u201d", "id": "5a95510badad664a16b0fc0e", "keywords": "movies,jennifer lawrence,harvey weinstein,stephen colbert ,sexual misconduct,stephen colbert", "news_keywords": "movies,jennifer lawrence,harvey weinstein,stephen colbert ,sexual misconduct,stephen colbert", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a95510badad664a16b0fc0e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cHe is just that horrible ass boil that does not go away.\u201d\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cHe is just that horrible ass boil that does not go away.\u201d", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Harvey Weinstein Is a \u201cHorrible Ass Boil\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-harvey-weinstein-horrible-boil"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "\u201cHe is just that horrible ass boil that does not go away.\u201d", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9563e40acfa84d3c08ca3f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Harvey Weinstein Is a \u201cHorrible Ass Boil\u201d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zr8R4y5QFDo"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
