I don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll drink the juice. I\u2019ll take a nap. I don\u2019t give a damn. But seriously, I would love for him to play my grandfather in something.\u201d\n\nOf course, social media went in on the comedian almost immediately. Fans were not fond of Haddish for taking Cosby\u2019s rape allegations so lightly.\n\nRelated: Bill Cosby Sexual Assault Case Ends In Mistrial Following Jury Deadlock\n\nThe actress went to the Television Critics Association panel to promote The Last O.G, an upcoming TBS series, where she attempted to clarify her comments.\n\nTiffany said:\n\n\u201cIt was a joke\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been interviewed. You go through about 27 interviews and you\u2019re supposed to be humorous \u2014 sometimes you are going to make some bad jokes.\u201d\n\nShe continues to say she\u2019s not afraid to work with whoever she wants to:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to do any kind of role as long as it doesn\u2019t compromise my morals\u2026 I don\u2019t agree with what he did, but I\u2019m not afraid of the big bad wolf.\u201d\n\n#PressPlay to watch the clarification above.\n\n#Socialites, do YOU think the comments Tiffany Haddish made were insensitive, or was it just an innocent joke?\n\nCheck out pictures
