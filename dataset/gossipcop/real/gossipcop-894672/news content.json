So to make this summer easier on you and your makeup routine, we reached out to prominent makeup artists for their best tips, tricks and product recs to keep your makeup looking good all season long.\n\nAhead, check out five summer makeup tips from some of our favorite makeup artists.\n\nChange the Way You Use Your Primer\n\n\u201cMy favorite tip for wearing summer makeup is mixing a primer with your foundation. It thins out your foundation for a more fresh wear,\u201d explains Lilit Caradanian, Makeup Artist & Owner of Elcie Cosmetics. \u201cMix with Elcie Pearl Radiance Primer for the perfect glow from within look.\u201d\n\nOpt for Cream Products Over Powder Ones\n\n\u201cIn the summer, it\u2019s best to practice the \u201cless is more\u201d rule,\u201d says Lanc\u00f4me Beauty Advisor Jillian Jordan. \u201cLightweight makeup will hold up and work better in the sticky, muggy summer weather. Dewy glowy skin is definitely in! Put down the powder products and try using more creams and liquids in the summer. Cream products will make your skin look more dewy, healthy, and hydrated!\u201d\n\nCombine Your Foundation and Moisturizer for Lightweight Coverage\n\n\u201cMany people apply a lot of heavy layers of makeup, as they may normally do [during non-summer months] \u2014 such a no-no when trying extend the long wear of your makeup,\u201d says Lanc\u00f4me Beauty Advisor Olivia Thompson. \u201cIt is okay to layer; however light layers are the key. For a glam but lightweight look, mix a pump of foundation with a small amount of moisturizer.\u201d\n\n-\n\nChange Up Your Makeup Textures\n\n\u201cFor summer, I always have my clients switch out the textures of their makeup products, like sheer veils of color and looks for long wear,\u201d explains Giorgio Armani celebrity makeup artist Tim Quinn. \u201cFor the eyes, Giorgio Armani Eye Tints for crease-proof washes of color and a a multi-function primer like Maestro UV for water resistance and SPF 50. Finish with a more matte finish foundation, a sweep of bronzer and a sheer pink for lips.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Be Afraid to Try a Playful Trend\n\n\u201cSummer is a time we can be super playful with our makeup,\u201d says NYC makeup artist Kasey Spickard. \u201cI work with a lot of Korean beauty brands, and I'm obsessed with the popsicle lip. Take a high shine lipstick in a pinky orange like Maybelline Shine Compulsion in Pink Fetish, and apply that to just the center of your lips. Press together and then layer on a high shine gloss to make your lips super juicy!\u201d\n\nWear Sunscreen, Always\n\n\u201cI have to wear sunscreen every day, especially when I know I\u2019m going to be outside, and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s sunny or not,\u201d says Lanc\u00f4me Beauty Advisor Marwah Khamas. \u201cI normally start with my skin care products and then whenever I\u2019m ready to put on my makeup I apply my sunscreen. My favorite is Lanc\u00f4me Bienfait UV 50+. Wait a few minutes before applying your makeup to give your skin enough time to soak in the sunscreen. Then continue with primer and foundation.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nGetting That Bronze Summer Glow Is Easy Thanks To This Tutorial\n\nA Guide to Finding the Best Makeup Brush Holder for Your Personality\n\n6 Best Primers for Combination Skin That Will Forever Change How Your Makeup Wears\n\nCourtesy Maybelline for Laquan Smith", "images": ["https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_youtube/social-facebook-black.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/americas/us/articles/2018/march/9-eyeshadow-palettes/marisa-petrarca.jpg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_youtube/social-youtube-black.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_twitter.svg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/americas/us/articles/2018/july/3-mua/makeupcompostgraphicshero4muasummertips7318-1.jpg?w=400&h=400&blr=False&hash=1E37E2F5744AFF8ACDFA9B0DB5A4D6E6", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mP8Xw8AAoMBgDTD2qgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_youtube/social-instagram-black.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/americas/us/logo/2020_mudcbylusa_logo_black_41620-outlined.svg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_youtube/social-twitter-black.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_facebook.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_twitter.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_facebook.svg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/logo/loreal-logo.png", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_instagram.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_youtube/social-pinterest-black.svg ", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_pinterest.svg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_pinterest.svg ", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/americas/us/articles/2018/july/3-mua/makeupcompostgraphicshero4muasummertips7318-1.jpg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_copy.svg", "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/shared/baseline/social-icons/social-icons-white_youtube.svg "], "top_img": "https://www.makeup.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/mdc/americas/us/articles/2018/july/3-mua/makeupcompostgraphicshero4muasummertips7318-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.makeup.com/makeup-tutorials/spring-and-summer/makeup-artist-best-summer-makeup-tips", "title": "Best Summer Beauty Tips According to Top Makeup Artists", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "We\u2019ve rounded up some of our favorite makeup artist beauty tips for summer 2018.
