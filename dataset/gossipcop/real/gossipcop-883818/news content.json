She continued by admitting on their summer vacation to Australia, it was Cuoco who was stopped and asked about her bag. I was \u201cthinking I\u2019m going to get a compliment on my purse,\u201d she joked.\n\nUnfortunately, Cuoco wasn\u2019t stopped to be asked about a designer, but rather because of the wine opener in her bag. \u201cLike the arms one, like a Rabbit,\u201d she told the host, \u201cand I was like, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 That\u2019s a weapon.\u201d\n\nCuoco continued by explaining that the TSA agent proceeded to search her other bags and found a second wine opener in her makeup bag. \u201cShe, like, takes it out and I\u2019m like, oh my God, I\u2019m going to be on a no-fly list,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe TSA agent proceeded to tell Cuoco that she isn\u2019t allowed to have a wine opener on the plane and the actress defended herself in a straightforward manner, saying she is a \u201cbig drinker\u201d and adding, \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she said to the agent, \u201cI just like alcohol and, apparently, I needed to be very prepared.\u201d\n\nTo hear Cuoco tell the hilarious story herself, watch the video below:", "images": ["https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/Bernadette.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/9873695.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/02/Penny1.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/close.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2017/09/6855749.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/Wolowitz.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/plugins/cm-emailoverlay/close.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/05/Big-Bang-Theory-End.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/22670791-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/01/11141204.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oliviadipede-150x150.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2015/11/Johnny-Galecki.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/09/6855749.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop/qool-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2015/04/Big-Bang-3-copy.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_480,$w_895/f10/2017/09/16873727.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_400,$w_400/f10/2017/09/16873727.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/12/12845588.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2016/11/10417951.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/16873727-748x1024.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/03937763.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/11/10417951.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/12/13517529.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/02/05394925.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2014/07/shutterstock_147284705.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2015/04/Big-Bang-3-copy.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/02/Stuart-Bloom.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/JPI_Episode13832_0001864744-600x337.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/hamburger.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FEB10fame10logo-web-1.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/03/Ellen-DeGeneres-Finger-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/11/11066145.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/16873727-748x1024.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fame10.com/trending-news/big-bang-star-kaley-cuocos-love-of-wine-leads-to-awkward-incident/", "title": "Big Bang Star Kaley Cuoco\u2019s Love Of Wine Leads To Awkward Incident", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Big Bang Star Kaley Cuoco\u2019s Love Of Wine Leads To Awkward Incident", "description": "Photo by SilverHub/REX/Shutterstock While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco opened up to Jimmy Kimmel about an awkward incident she had with a TSA agent for packing two wine openers.
