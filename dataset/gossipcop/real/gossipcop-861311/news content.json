Jenner lends her face (via campaign imagery) and name (via a \"Formawell Beauty x Kendall Jenner\" subtitle) to the line, which includes a flat iron, ionic blow-dryer and curling iron. The products in the line include a blow-dryer, flatiron, curling iron and several brushes with prices ranging from $14.99 to $119; they are already available at FormawellBeauty.com and will also be sold at department, specialty and mass retailers.\n\nKendall Jenner for Formawell's Runway Series.

The Kardashian-Jenner family in general has seen much success in the cosmetics industry over the last few years, but those wins have come hard-fought after many previous trials and struggles in the beauty business.\n\nWith cases like The Est\u00e9e Edit, some in the industry have pointed out that Jenner's engagement with (and commitment to) the brand \u2014 particularly when it came to sharing on social media \u2014 left much room for improvement. It seems Formawell is hedging its bets, as the marketing push for its new styling tool range will also include 15 other social media influencers who combine for more than 200 million followers, according to WWD.\n\nEarlier this week, I asked Jenner's sister Kim Kardashian West, who has built somewhat of a beauty empire herself, whether she'd be expanding into the hair category anytime soon. \"I talk about expanding into hair all the time. The right partnership hasn't come about, but I do think about it and I do talk about it,\" she said. It seems that for Jenner, the right partnership has arrived \u2014 at least for the time being.\n\nStay current on the latest trends, news and people shaping the fashion industry.
