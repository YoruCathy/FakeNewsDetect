Our cues are be a man, stand up, don\u2019t cry \u2026 I want to be open, I want to have the emotional tools it takes to keep my family together.\n\n\u201cI have a beautiful wife who\u2019s understanding and knew that I\u2019m not the worst of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we did the hard work of going to therapy. We love each other. We put in the work. This music that I\u2019m making now is a result of things that have happened earlier. Like you, I like to believe that we\u2019re in a better place today, but still working, still communicating and growing. I\u2019m proud of the father and the husband I am today because of all of the work that I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nJay-Z and Beyonce, who have been married since 2008 and have three children together, made headlines last year after each released albums addressing Jay-Z\u2019s infidelity, with Beyonce dubbing the other woman \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d on \u201cLemonade.\u201d In response, on his \u201c4:44\u201d album last year, the rapper apologized multiple times and vowed to put in the work for his relationship. The two will spend several months on their \u201cOn the Run II\u201d tour this year, which launches June 6 in the U.K., heads across Europe before moving to North America on July 25, and continuing across the continent before wrapping in Seattle on Oct. 4.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Jay-Z said that he thinks that what President Trump is \u201cforcing people to do is have a conversation and band together and work together. You can\u2019t address something that\u2019s not revealed. He\u2019s bringing out an ugly side of America that we wanted to believe is gone \u2026 We still gotta deal with it. We have to have tough conversations \u2013 talk about the N-word, talk about why white men are so privileged in this country.\u201d He added that he predicts there will be a record-breaking number of voters in the next election.\n\nJay-Z also discussed his tumultuous relationship with West, saying, \u201che\u2019s like a brother to me, do you get along with your family all of the time?\u201d and his reaction to his mother, Gloria Carter, coming out as gay.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif",
