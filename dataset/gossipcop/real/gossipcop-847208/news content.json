Aside from both actively pursuing solo careers, it turns out they also have the same taste in music.\n\nInstead of attending Coachella, the two stars went to the event in California following weekend two, Stagecoach Music Festival. They were all smiles as they caught the legendary Shania Twain's performance with some friends and even had the Instagram to prove it because pics or it didn't happen, right?\n\nThough the selfie was a little blurry as it was taken at night, catching a later set only solidified their friendship even further and not to mention, they were already matching in black tees. The two really looked like they were having the best time and since it is a weekend long event, we can't help but wonder who else they saw in the lineup or how they even met up. With Niall's new music on the way and that solo debut album fans have been waiting for, maybe he called Nick up for some inspiration. Or maybe it was the other way around? Nick's Last Year Was Complicated album dropped last year, so it's about time fans get some new music.\n\nWhatever it was, we're totally here for this bromance and can't wait to see what they do next.\n\nRelated: Shawn Mendes Says He and Niall Horan Will Write a Song Together\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5908c6f8fecec434388f31a6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/niall-nick-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5908c657783fc429b031c1be/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/niall-nick.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5908c6f8fecec434388f31a6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/niall-nick-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isis Briones", "Isis Brione"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/niall-horan-nick-jonas-stagecoach-music-festival-2017", "title": "Niall Horan and Nick Jonas Attend Stagecoach Music Festival Together", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Isis Briones", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Check out the daring outfit Kendall Jenner wore to the Met Gala 2017 after party.
