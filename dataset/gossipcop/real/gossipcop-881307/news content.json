The height of a girl's skirt or whatever she is wearing for that matter, does not imply what she is asking for. It sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I'm 'asking for it,'\" she wrote.\n\n\"I typically never give power to the mean things people bravely say behind their computer screens on the Internet, but this is for the girls who are constantly bullied whether it be online or at school,\" she continued. \"You are not asking for anything because of what you are wearing- you are expressing yourself and don't you ever think you deserve the negativity as the consequence to what you are wearing- YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. Celebrate you and don't let anyone's comments allow you to think less of yourself. Us girls have to stick together!!!!!!\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the former child star has faced body shamers. She recently talked about harsh bullying she's been exposed to in the past.\n\n\"The Internet bullies are awful,\" she told Glamour.com. \"I could post a photo where I feel good, and 500 people will comment about how fat I am, and that I am disgusting. On [red carpets], I just said to myself, 'You have to do your best to look confident and stand up tall, and make yourself look as good as you can in these photos,' because everyone is going to see them.\"\n\nWe love that Ariel is standing up for herself, don't you?!\n\nFor more of today's hottest headlines, check out the video below:", "images": ["http://toofab.akamaized.net/2015/11/14/1114-ariel-inset-810x960.jpg", "https://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/elite-daily-logo-1.png", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/skeleton.svg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rsss-justjared-logo-cut-v2.gif", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/cdl-260x30-for-tmz3-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/19/newsletter-logo-v2-1.png", "http://toofab.akamaized.net/2015/11/14/1114-ariel-main-1200x630.jpg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png"], "top_img": "http://toofab.akamaized.net/2015/11/14/1114-ariel-main-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toofab Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://toofab.com/2015/11/14/ariel-winter-slams-haters-bikini-photos/", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Haters For Saying \"She Is Asking For It\" In New Bikini Pic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"toofab": 116547240, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@toofab", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Haters For Saying \"She Is Asking For It\" In New Bikini Pic", "description": "Ariel Winter shared a family pic of herself sporting a bikini during a day of fun with her nieces on Friday, but it was greeted with some negative comments from her Instagram followers.", "image": "http://toofab.akamaized.net/2015/11/14/1114-ariel-main-1200x630.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "description": "Ariel Winter shared a family pic of herself sporting a bikini during a day of fun with her nieces on Friday, but it was greeted with some negative comments from her Instagram followers.", "robots": "index,follow", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://toofab.com/2015/11/14/ariel-winter-slams-haters-bikini-photos/", "site_name": "toofab", "type": "article", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Haters For Saying \"She Is Asking For It\" In New Bikini Pic", "description": "Ariel Winter shared a family pic of herself sporting a bikini during a day of fun with her nieces on Friday, but it was greeted with some negative comments from her Instagram followers.", "image": "http://toofab.akamaized.net/2015/11/14/1114-ariel-main-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116046798441464, "pages": 324392354652}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TooFab"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1447430400.0, "source": "http://toofab.com", "summary": ""}
