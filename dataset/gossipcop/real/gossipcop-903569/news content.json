How could I possibly have been more popular?\u201d Chalamet also pointed out that Elgort was a star in the musical theater performances, while he was reduced to making rap videos about statistics.\n\nElgort had a caveat that Chalamet couldn't deny, however.\n\n\"No one disliked Timmy,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people disliked me. Everyone loves Timmy.\u201d", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/south-korea-daily-coronavirus-cases.jpg?h=52", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-world-together-at-home-tv-special.jpg?h=52", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/white-house-trump-rosa-parks.jpg?h=52", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?w=720&quality=85", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?w=720"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?w=720", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5096112/ansel-elgort-and-timothee-chalamet/", "title": "Timothee Chalamet and Ansel Elgort on Who Was More Popular", "meta_data": {"description": "Former classmates Timothee Chalamet and Ansel Elgort can't agree over who was more popular while they attended LaGuardia High School.", "keywords": "Timothee Chalamet, Timothee Chalamet 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort friends, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort high school", "news_keywords": "Timothee Chalamet, Timothee Chalamet 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort friends, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort high school", "og": {"site_name": "Time", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://time.com/5096112/ansel-elgort-and-timothee-chalamet/", "title": "Timothee Chalamet, Ansel Elgort Discuss Who Was More Popular", "description": "LaGuardia's finest", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?w=720"}, "author": "Cady Lang", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "twitter": {"site": "@TIME", "title": "Timothee Chalamet, Ansel Elgort Discuss Who Was More Popular", "description": "LaGuardia's finest", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"author": "https://time.com/author/cady-lang/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
