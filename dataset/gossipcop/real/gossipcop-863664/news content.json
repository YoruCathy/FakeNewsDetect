Before Andy Cohen took the reins, questioning various members of the cast, the packed room was treated to a montage of classic clips. Obviously, Aviva Drescher\u2019s airborne leg elicited the loudest reaction. \u201cSonja, have you been able to get back into Le Cirque since Aviva threw the leg?\u201d Cohen asked. \u201cLuckily I\u2019m very good friends with the owner,\u201d Morgan replied, straight-faced, with Dorinda Medley joking, \u201cI think it\u2019s closed because of the leg-throwing.\u201d\n\nThe lively conversation between EP\u2019s Andy Cohen and Lisa Shannon and cast members Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley and Tinsley Mortimer charted the series\u2019 evolution from a would-be show about moms trying to raise children in the big city. These days, the experts concluded, The Real Housewives of New York City is a comedy through and through\u2014a \u201cmodern-day soap opera\u201d with a decades\u2019 worth of iconic quotes and GIF-able moments.\n\nWhen Medley first heard about the potential series from her friend Ramona Singer, she laughed, \u201cI was like, that sounds so stupid! That sounds ridiculous, who\u2019d watch it!\u2026I was in such a mode of being Mrs. Medley that I kind of looked at my friends and thought, oh look at them doing that show there, I could never do that.\u201d\n\nReflecting back on a decade of RHONY, Medley touched on a recurring panel theme\u2014unexpected gratitude for reality TV infamy. \u201cI was so used to people recognizing my husband and not me, and then all of a sudden\u2026\u201d Medley recalled, noting her transformation from political wife to TV star. \u201cYou realize that you have this platform, and this ability to affect people, and they really think they know you.\u201d Also: \u201cNo more walking around in pajamas.\u201d\n\nAsked how she\u2019s changed over the seasons, Morgan quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, I really haven\u2019t changed, so I\u2019m still behaving badly. I do walk my dog in my pajamas, I do make out with people on the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good thing, as Dorinda pointed out, we do get to support our charities in a big way now. It gave me back my independence after my divorce,\u201d she continued, saying her Bravo gig has allowed her to provide \u201cfinancial and emotional stability\u201d for her daughter.\n\nMortimer has had her own unique arc, joining the cast in 2017 following a trespassing arrest in Palm Beach. \u201cHonestly I had hit such a low point in my life, with a mug shot in Palm Beach,\u201d Mortimer confessed. \u201cI literally thought, I\u2019m already so low that why not join a reality TV show?\u201d Still, she remembered being initially taken aback when two of the cast members started fighting during a dinner scene. \u201cI\u2019m like, who screams at a dinner table? Flash forward to next season, I\u2019m screaming at Sonja at the same dinner table!\u201d\n\nLater on she revisited her pre-RHONY personal nadir, saying: \u201cLook, the Palm Beach mugshot can do a lot for you. Look at the comeback with me and with Luann\u2026A spokesman for the Palm Beach police department should be like, wanna turn your life around? Come chat with us.\u201d\n\nThe cast also shared some of their favorite scenes and tag lines, with Sonja Morgan seamlessly transitioning into a \u201cshameless plug\u201d for her eponymous clothing and accessories line: \u201cI do have a taste for luxury and luxury has a taste for me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThat was my first [tag line] and I think it\u2019s come full circle with my collection.\u201d\n\nOf course, even professional Housewives have moments they regret committing to camera. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t bring this up again,\u201d Mortimer began, \u201cBut yes, when we were playing truth or dare and I talked about my ex-husband and something that we did\u2026That was pretty embarrassing, I got a lot of heat from that.\u201d Pressed by Cohen, Mortimer admitted that the heat definitely came from her ex\u2014\u201cAnd his new wife!\u201d Meanwhile, Morgan rejoined, \u201cThe only regret I have is not being filmed.\u201d\n\nTransitioning from real New Yorkers to reality TV New Yorkers has occasionally been surreal. While standing on the street the other day, Mortimer shared, she was recognized by a Real Housewives of New York tour bus. \u201cSo I got on the bus.\u201d she casually announced. \u201cIt was so sweet!\u201d\n\n\u201c New Yorkers love the show so much, they\u2019re like fuck my brunch, this is amazing. \u201d\n\n\u201cI think we ruined someone\u2019s brunch in the Hamptons\u201d Medley recalled, when asked if New Yorkers are ever less than pleased with the omnipresent production. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a love-hate thing\u2014they kind of love it too,\u201d Morgan countered. \u201cNew Yorkers love the show so much, they\u2019re like fuck my brunch, this is amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on hot-dog stands!\u201d She shouted. \u201cWe sell hot dogs!\u201d\n\nCohen pointed out that, particularly in the New York iteration of the Real Housewives franchise, \u201cThere\u2019s a unique fourth-wall element.\u201d He continued, \u201cPage Six and the New York Post has been a character\u2026Season two opened with the women all, I think they were in the Hamptons, and I think Simon van Kampen had blabbed to Cindy Adams about something, or Jill Zarin had blabbed about Simon, it was something, and they were all opening the paper and reacting to it. And that was the first time as the Housewives franchise that we\u2019ve had to deal with the outside press coming in. And of course, they\u2019re partially getting press because they\u2019re on this show.\u201d\n\nIn addition to New Yorkers and tabloid reporters, the show\u2019s fandom also boasts a number of A-listers. Cohen revealed that they\u2019d connected Medley with multiple celebrity admirers. \u201cI\u2019m still in contact with Sarah Paulson!\u201d Medley offered. She has also bonded with Lady Gaga, saying, \u201cI actually just was in contact with her and her mother about two weeks ago, she was here. I\u2019m trying to get Cynthia [Lady Gaga\u2019s mother] on the show.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to comment, Morgan was initially coy, refusing to name any stars she\u2019d spoken with. But when another panelist mentioned the 30 Rock Sonja Morgan shout-out, she acquiesced: \u201cOk, I\u2019ll out Tina Fey\u2014I don\u2019t sleep with her, but I was her favorite.\u201d\n\nEMBED PIC\n\nWhile Morgan repeatedly plugged her collection during the panel, Cohen was uncharacteristically coy when asked by an audience member if Bravo benefits financially from the many RHONY side hustles. \u201cUm, I actually don\u2019t know that I can speak about that, they don\u2019t love me speaking about contractual issues,\u201d the Watch What Happens Live! host demurred. \u201cI will say we all benefit richly from the show just through our hearts.\u201d\n\nLisa Shannon attributed the show\u2019s winning formula to the authenticity of its cast and their organic chemistry, remarking, \u201cThey do a really good job of being real. Off-camera, these women are these women.\u201d Throughout the panel, these dynamics were front and center, with cast mates bickering, cutting each other off, and throwing out backhanded compliments\u2014all from a place of seemingly genuine affection. At one point, Morgan mocked Mortimer for tacking herself on to a plan, laughing, \u201cYou know those Australian koala bears that clip on?\u201d She continued, \u201cThat\u2019s how Luann is too by the way, and I love it. I love to be needed.\u201d\n\nOr as Cohen remarked, \u201cPeople are always saying, is it real, is it real\u2014we couldn\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201d\n\nAnd while audience members were warned that the panel couldn\u2019t discuss upcoming plot points, the stars did answer a question about if they intended to settle down again any time soon. \u201cI\u2019m ready now,\u201d Morgan insisted. \u201cAs soon as my daughter gets her early acceptance in December, the single men who are available should watch out. I\u2019m coming for them.\u201d Meanwhile, Medley responded, \u201cI think I\u2019m good right now. But I never say never.\u201d\n\nAsked how they would feel about Jill Zarin potentially returning to the franchise, Cohen replied, \u201cI always say The Housewives is like the mob, you can never get out of the family.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_646,w_1149,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537751088/Screen_Shot_2018-09-23_at_8.14.21_PM_yje0xo", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_646,w_1149,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537751088/Screen_Shot_2018-09-23_at_8.14.21_PM_yje0xo"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_646,w_1149,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537751088/Screen_Shot_2018-09-23_at_8.14.21_PM_yje0xo", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/spilling-tea-with-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-im-still-behaving-badly", "title": "Spilling Tea With \u2018The Real Housewives of New York City\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m Still Behaving Badly\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Spilling Tea With \u2018The Real Housewives of New York City\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m Still Behaving Badly\u2019", "keywords": "New York City, The Real Housewives of New York City, Reality television, Bethenny Frankel, Andy Cohen", "og": {"title": "Spilling Tea With \u2018The Real Housewives of New York City\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m Still Behaving Badly\u2019", "description": "Several of the RHONY gathered with producers Andy Cohen and Lisa Shannon to discuss 10 years of reality-TV madness, regrets, secret celebrity admirers, and more.", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/spilling-tea-with-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-im-still-behaving-badly", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_646,w_1149,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537751088/Screen_Shot_2018-09-23_at_8.14.21_PM_yje0xo"}, "description": "Several of the RHONY gathered with producers Andy Cohen and Lisa Shannon to discuss 10 years of reality-TV madness, regrets, secret celebrity admirers, and more.", "authors": "Amy Zimmerman", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2018-09-24T01:06:23.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/amy-zimmerman"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@ahzimm", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_646,w_1149,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537751088/Screen_Shot_2018-09-23_at_8.14.21_PM_yje0xo"}, "sailthru.date": "2018-09-24T01:06:23.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2018-10-08T01:06:23.000Z", "publicationDate": 201809240106, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Amy Zimmerman\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/spilling-tea-with-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-im-still-behaving-badly\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\",\"rubric\":\"BEHIND THE SCENES\"},\"post_id\":\"spilling-tea-with-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-im-still-behaving-badly\",\"pub_date\":\"2018-09-24T01:06:23+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"tags\":[\"New York City\",\"The Real Housewives of New York City\",\"Reality television\",\"Bethenny Frankel\",\"Andy Cohen\",\"typeArticle\"],\"title\":\"Spilling Tea With \u2018The Real Housewives of New York City\u2019: \u2018I\u2019m Still Behaving Badly\u2019\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxfQ6UjRzi4?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0"], "publish_date": 1537751183.0, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
