In addition to talking about the joy that her 1-year-old son Eissa Al Mana brings, Jackson writes of the darker times as well.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to happiness, I\u2019m no expert,\u201d she writes in the letter. \u201cI have only my life experience as a guide. I\u2019ve known great happiness and great sadness.\"\n\nJackson's 30s were far from perfect, plagued with mental health issues.\n\n\u201cI struggled with depression. The struggle was intense,\" she writes. \"Low self-esteem might be rooted in childhood feelings of inferiority. It could relate to failing to meet impossibly high standards.\n\n\"And of course there are always the societal issues of racism and sexism,\" she continues. \"Put it all together and depression is a tenacious and scary condition. Thankfully, I found my way through it.\u201d\n\nMore:Janet Jackson surprises Missy Elliott with Essence honor\n\nThe following decade was also challenging for her.\n\n\u201cIn my forties: Like millions of women in the world, I still heard voices inside my head berating me, voices questioning my value,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cHappiness was elusive,\" she adds. \"A reunion with old friends might make me happy. A call from a colleague might make me happy. But because sometimes I saw my failed relationships as my fault, I easily fell into despair.\u201d\n\nIn her fifties, however, Jackson has found a source of joy, her baby boy. Even amid a contentious split from Eissa's father, Wissam Al Mana. Early this month, law enforcement performed a welfare check on the child in Al Mana's custody, at Jackson's request. Public Information Officer Deputy Tracy Koerner told USA TODAY no arrests were made.\n\nJackson's brother Randy previously alleged his sister was verbally abused by Al Mana, a charge lawyers for Al Mana called \"deeply hurtful\" in a statement to People magazine.\n\nBut on balance, it seems Jackson has found contentment.\n\n\"The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,\" she says in her letter. \"When I kiss him. When I sing him softly to sleep. During those sacred times, happiness is everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe new issue of Essence arrives on newsstands Friday.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31cdba80e01dcc0cf266cc7aee76a8110cea8bb5/c=0-0-4987-2818/local/-/media/2018/06/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636650875599487321-AP-Super-Bowl-Janet-Jackson-Timberlake-97118507.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31cdba80e01dcc0cf266cc7aee76a8110cea8bb5/c=0-0-4987-2818/local/-/media/2018/06/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636650875599487321-AP-Super-Bowl-Janet-Jackson-Timberlake-97118507.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5786755731001_5786754030001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31cdba80e01dcc0cf266cc7aee76a8110cea8bb5/c=0-0-4987-2818/local/-/media/2018/06/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636650875599487321-AP-Super-Bowl-Janet-Jackson-Timberlake-97118507.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/06/20/janet-jackson-depression-essence-good-morning-america-gma/717494002/", "title": "Janet Jackson talks 'intense' battle with depression: 'Thankfully, I found my way through'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Janet Jackson talks 'intense' battle with depression: 'Thankfully, I found my way through'", "description": "\"I\u2019ve known great happiness and great sadness,\" Janet Jackson writes in a letter for Essence magazine's July/August issue.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/06/20/janet-jackson-depression-essence-good-morning-america-gma/717494002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31cdba80e01dcc0cf266cc7aee76a8110cea8bb5/c=0-0-4987-2818/local/-/media/2018/06/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636650875599487321-AP-Super-Bowl-Janet-Jackson-Timberlake-97118507.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "\"I\u2019ve known great happiness and great sadness,\" Janet Jackson writes in a letter for Essence magazine's July/August issue.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31cdba80e01dcc0cf266cc7aee76a8110cea8bb5/c=0-0-4987-2818/local/-/media/2018/06/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636650875599487321-AP-Super-Bowl-Janet-Jackson-Timberlake-97118507.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Janet Jackson talks 'intense' battle with depression: 'Thankfully, I found my way through'", "description": "\"I\u2019ve known great happiness and great sadness,\" Janet Jackson writes in a letter for Essence magazine's July/August issue."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529424000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
