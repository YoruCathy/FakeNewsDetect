And when I tell people that, they\u2019re like, \u2018You\u2019re 23, why do you need to do that? Why do you need to freeze your eggs?\u2019 Doing an ovarian reserve is important to me because I\u2019m fortunate enough to have that as an option, but I need to be aggressive about protecting my fertility, about protecting myself,\u201d Halsey \u2014 whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane \u2014 said on Thursday\u2019s episode of The Doctors.\n\nImage zoom Halsey Dimitrios Kambouris/amfAR/Getty Images\n\nHalsey spoke openly about her endometriosis for the first time in January 2017, detailing the \u201cfrustrating\u201d process of getting diagnosed.\n\n\u201cThe thing with endometriosis is that it comes down to that doctors can tend to minimize the female experience when it comes to dealing with it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole life, my mother had always told me, \u2018Women in our family just have really bad periods.\u2019 It was just something she thought she was cursed to deal with and I was cursed to deal with, and that was just a part of my life.\u201d\n\nBut as Halsey toured the world to perform, the stress from being on stage \u2014 along with her undiagnosed physical health issues \u2014 became too much to bear. One day she collapsed outside her tour bus.\n\n\u201cMy tour manager had to take me to a hospital. And the whole time I was there no one knew what to tell me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cDehydration, stress, anxiety and I was saying, \u2018What about my pain?\u2019 A lot of the time they can make you think it\u2019s in your head.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she met Dr. Thais Aliabadi that she finally learned she had endometriosis.\n\n\u201cIt was so bittersweet, because it was the relief of knowing that I wasn\u2019t making it up, and I wasn\u2019t being sensitive, and it wasn\u2019t all in my head, but it also kind of sucked to know that I was going to be living with this forever,\u201d Halsey said.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Halsey Opens Up About Her Endometriosis Battle\n\nAnd just a few months after her diagnosis, she underwent a traumatic experience.\n\n\u201cI was on tour, and I found out I was pregnant. And before I could really figure out what that meant to me and what that meant for my future, for my career, for my life, for my relationship, the next thing I knew I was on stage miscarrying in the middle of my concert,\u201d Halsey revealed. \u201cAnd the sensation of looking a couple hundred teenagers in the face while you\u2019re bleeding through your clothes and still having to do the show, and realizing in that moment that I never want to make that choice ever again of doing what I love or not being able to because of this disease.\u201d\n\nThe experience pushed her to find a way to manage the chronic disorder, and with the help of Dr. Aliabadi, she got an IUD and underwent surgery.\n\nA year later, Halsey said she \u201cfeels much better\u201d now and is confident in her decision to freeze her eggs and take control of her fertility.\n\n\u201cReproductive illness is so frustrating because it can really make you feel like less of a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when you\u2019re sitting at home and you just feel so terrible about yourself. You\u2019re sick, you don\u2019t feel sexy, you don\u2019t feel proud, you don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much hope. And so taking these measures, so that hopefully I can have a bright future and achieve the things that I want to achieve by doing the ovarian reserve is really important.\u201d\n\nThe Doctors airs weekdays.
