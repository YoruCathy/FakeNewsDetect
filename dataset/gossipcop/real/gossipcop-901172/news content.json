She\u2019s trapped. She wrestles with the knob, bangs on the giant wooden barrier, and then throws herself against it with all her might.\n\nIt works. She breaks through, and that\u2019s the point. The scene is meant, largely, to symbolize Nora\u2019s breakthrough; that she wants to see her long lost love, Kevin (Justin Theroux), despite claims to the contrary. But what makes the scene work is Coon. It\u2019s a moment of comedic absurdity amid a tragically romantic storyline, and Coon hits all the right notes. It\u2019s reminiscent of when she flipped out on a parking barrier in Episode 2 and then went directly to her friend\u2019s house to talk (and take a few bounces on a trampoline).\n\nCoon finds the truth in every moment, no matter how ridiculous, no matter how unbelievable. It\u2019s what makes her closing speech so powerful, and it\u2019s what makes Nora Durst one of the best characters of the 21st century. Coon understood the humanity of her role long before anyone could see past her darkness, and that guiding light made the journey to serenity immeasurably satisfying.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Do Machines Hate Carrie Coon on \u2018Fargo\u2019 and \u2018The Leftovers\u2019?\n\nRupert Friend, \u201cHomeland\u201d\n\nAfter taking the appropriate amount of time to grieve, we\u2019ve come to the following conclusion: Rupert Friend\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d swan song was a two-season affair. Perhaps Quinn really did die in Season 5, and Season 6 was just how Carrie (Claire Danes) had to say goodbye, with her one-time love living in her home, halfway to death\u2019s door. She indeed got him the rest of the way, to a hero\u2019s end. But while she did that for Quinn, Friend carried him throughout it all; through the reign of the Drone Queen to the heartbreak of losing Carrie all over again; through a brutal, infamous poisoning to wandering into drug dens with prostitutes. Quinn\u2019s journey was long and complicated, but Friend found honesty and power in every grave choice and dangerous situation. The physicality alone demands respect, and Friend made us feel for Quinn more than we ever expected \u2014 no matter when you said goodbye.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Homeland\u2019: An Ode to Rupert Friend\u2019s Quinn After a Divisive Finale\n\nKathryn Hahn, \u201cI Love Dick\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so easy for a performance to be dominated by a single emotion, something that makes Hahn\u2019s starring role as Chris in \u201cI Love Dick\u201d all the more impressive. It\u2019s a character that\u2019s dealing with raging desire, crippling frustration, and all-consuming obsession, and Hahn plays all sides of that internal tug-of-war with equal ease. As Chris\u2019 life gets yanked in multiple directions, Hahn somehow keeps her grounded in a fierce, intense drive toward self preservation. It\u2019s hard to be hopelessly in love with an idea of a person, much less the person themself. But this is a performance that shows us why it\u2019s a fundamental driver of what makes compelling drama in real life and in fictional versions of it. There\u2019s an intense physicality to Hahn\u2019s approach, too. It\u2019s not just in the emotions that she betrays, it\u2019s in the way that they take over every bit of movement and stillness.

It's understandable, since the Companion is our analog in this wacky world of flying police boxes, aliens and timey-wimeyness. From the very first episode though, Pearl Mackie's Bill instantly managed to worm her way into everyone\u2019s hearts, even the Doctor\u2019s two hearts. Mackie was able to sell a character who is overall sweet and happy, traits that usually come across on screen as simple-minded, with humor, poignancy and depth. She hands down asks the best questions of any Companion (\u201cYeah, hearts though, why two? Does this mean you have really high blood pressure?\u201d) and delivers these inquiries with a puppy-like enthusiasm and openness. Because of this, Mackie is also able to rip out our hearts with the tiniest flicker of disappointment or sorrow in her eyes. Mackie has brought to life a character who has no pretense, no cynicism, no darkness. It\u2019s such a shame that this is Peter Capaldi\u2019s final season as the Doctor because their on-screen chemistry is a joy to watch, and Mackie has rejuvenated the franchise.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\u2018Doctor Who\u2019 Review: Killer Finale Hints at a Female Doctor and Delivers Some Major Timelord Plot Twists\r\nMichael McKean, \"Better Call Saul\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most amazing thing about Chuck McGill, as portrayed by Michael McKean, is that you understand him so clearly. He's so fully realized and believable and human that, at times, you almost forget what a terrible, loathsome person he is. You don't want Chuck to be real, but there's no escaping the fact that McKean's performance is so grounded. You don't want Chuck to be right, but the more we get to know him, the more we know that all too often, he is. The Season 3 cliffhanger has us very worried about what may come next, but no matter what comes next, Chuck will remain an unforgettable part of the show, one whose words of truth will forever haunt us.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Review: Bob Odenkirk and Michael McKean Spar in an Ultimate Clash of the Brothers\r\nElisabeth Moss, \"The Handmaid's Tale\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we've noted throughout the show\u2019s early run, one of the true terrors of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is its gradual changes. We see each new violation on Moss\u2019 face, playing a character who\u2019s forced to limit her true range of expression in order to preserve her life. In scenes when paragraphs\u2019 worth of thoughts and desires and fears need to be conveyed, Moss can do it in a look. In most cases, it's trite to say that the most important lines of dialogue are the ones that remain unspoken, but in this case, Moss turns that well-worn adage into a defining element of her performance. It makes the occasional reprieve from the horrors of Gilead all the more satisfying, to see a character who has been downtrodden so brutally be given the chance to truly come alive. Moss handles both aspects with equal grace and expertise, giving us a whole life\u2019s history in a few select glances.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019: Intriguing Season 2 Secrets Revealed After Brutal Season Finale\r\nAubrey Plaza - \u201cLegion\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugged out. Alluring. Cunning. Sexy. Bat-shit crazy. Monstrous. These are just a few of the adjectives to describe Aubrey Plaza's Lenny. And while she plays multiple versions of the same character through different filters in the trippy comic book-inspired series, the common denominator is that she\u2019s an undeniable, intoxicating scene-stealer. Plaza initially joined \u201cLegion\u201d expecting to read for the female lead, but after a few conversations with creator Noah Hawley, landed the role of David Haller\u2019s (Dan Stevens) mental hospital chum and the face of an evil force which has taken up residence in his subconscious. Plaza brings intensity and an expressive physicality to each version of Lenny, making her insidious nature addictive. Although \u201cLegion\u201d seemingly wrote out the need for Lenny in the finale, we\u2019re still hoping that Hawley is able to bring her back in some form in Season 2.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\u2018Legion\u2019: Aubrey Plaza Reveals How David Bowie and Beetlejuice Helped Her Become a \u2018Rock Star\u2019 Monster\r\nSam Richardson, \"Veep\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTry as the show might to stuff its weekly runtime with enough jokes to feed its hefty ensemble, a half-hour always feels like too short a time to spend in the world of \u201cVeep.\u201d It\u2019s all the more valuable to have a character like Richard Splett to help cut through the cynicism, backstabbing, and distrust that permeates so much of the rest of the show. Much like his HBO Sunday comedy counterpoint Zach Woods, Richardson is an actor whose impeccable timing and finessed delivery made the show\u2019s writing staff find more ways to get him involved. Much like his character, Richard is the unassuming encyclopedia of \u201cVeep,\u201d waiting to be taken off the shelf whenever needed. In the process, he\u2019s ensured that each new layer of na\u00efvet\u00e9 (and parenthood) that gets thrust in SplettNet\u2019s direction will be met with the same cheery optimism.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\u2018Veep\u2019: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tony Hale and the Cast Pick Their Favorite Insults From Season 6\r\nJustin Theroux, \"The Leftovers\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the three-season run of \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d Justin Theroux was the show\u2019s physical and emotional anchor, as in times of distress and loneliness, Kevin Garvey was the closest the show came to an audience surrogate. He's a character who experienced loss, but Theroux\u2019s performance always engaged with that grief in a more gradual way, as vestiges of Kevin\u2019s old life and new one slowly began to slip away. As Kevin got whisked off to alternate planes of existence and put on an older man\u2019s clothes, Theroux made sure that all of these narrative curveballs were centered in the series\u2019 continual figure of redemption. Theroux embodied the uncertainty of an unforgiving world, keeping peace in times of relative serenity and reflecting the horror of a shifting reality. And when the last layers were finally pulled back, he showed the devotion that kept the series\u2019 central romance alive across decades.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u00a0\u2018The Leftovers\u2019: 7 Unambiguous, Post-Finale Facts from Justin Theroux, Carrie Coon, and the Creators\r\nReese Witherspoon, \"Big Little Lies\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSingling out one performance from this ensemble is a bit of a fool\u2019s errand, but as the hub through which this series runs, Witherspoon gets at the shadowy underbelly of this community better than anyone else could. Nearly every character on this show had something to hide, but one of Witherspoon's true accomplishments was being able to play Madeline\u2019s insecurity in a way that straddled the line between shifty string-puller and well-intentioned matriarch. Even as Madeline seesawed back and forth between these two ideas, Witherspoon still wrangled some empathy out of lines instantly quotable lines, like the one HBO rightly plastered in every promo. Madeline operated on her own sense of righteousness and logic, but Witherspoon still was able to tap into the DNA of the show to give it its most compelling character.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE:\u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 to \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019: In Defense of the One-and-Done Limited Series\r\n\r\nHonorable Mention: Kyle MacLachlan, \"Twin Peaks\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is happening on \"Twin Peaks\" this season, here's something we feel confident about saying: No one else could do the work that Kyle MacLachlan is doing. Playing approximately three characters (depending on your own interpretations), the many faces of Cooper have us confounded, bewildered, entranced and horrified (depending on the moment). All we honestly want is to see the good agent restored to his pure pie-and-philosophy-loving glory, but we also know that David Lynch and Mark Frost aren't inclined to give us happy endings. Still, we can't look away from MacLachlan whenever he's on screen \u2014 it's some of the most challenging but incredible acting of the year.\r\n\r\nStay on top of the latest TV news!
