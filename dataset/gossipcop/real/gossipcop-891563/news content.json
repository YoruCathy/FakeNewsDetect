I saw online that some people were offended by my Aaliyah costume and I am sorry if that offended anyone, but I wasn't dressing up as a race or culture, but rather as a woman I admire and think is amazing, so I don't agree honestly. I play all kinds of music in my home and I like for my kids to be exposed to many different artists as options for our Halloween costumes. We don't see color in my home. It's all love and respect. Kourtney was Michael Jackson for one of her costumes and she wasn't criticized. My son was Axel Rose. We are just paying homage to people and artists we love and respect \u2014 it's that simple!\"", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5a0084dd42fd751409205db8?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5a0084dd42fd751409205db8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-aaliyah-halloween-costume-apology-2017-11?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7?width=1200&format=jpeg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susanna Heller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/kim-kardashian-aaliyah-halloween-costume-apology-2017-11", "title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "date": "2017-11-06", "news_keywords": "Design, Celebrity, Kardashians, Kim Kardashian, Aaliyah, Halloween 2017, Halloween Costume, Susanna Heller", "description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "author": "Susanna Heller", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-aaliyah-halloween-costume-apology-2017-11", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-06", "sailthru.tags": "Design, Celebrity, Kardashians, Kim Kardashian, Aaliyah, Halloween 2017, Halloween Costume, Susanna Heller", "sailthru.description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "sailthru.author": "Susanna Heller", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/59ca783aba785e6cbe07134d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/59ca783aba785e6cbe07134d?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "control", "pfi-wider-content": "control", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "variant", "tabbed-homepage": "variant", "expanded-coverage-module": "control", "subscribe-smallest-price": "control"}, "viking-id": "5a0084de42fd751409205db9", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509897600.0, "source": "http://uk.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
