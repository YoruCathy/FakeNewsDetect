I am honored to depict a feminist who speaks her mind, who loves science and her friends and who sometimes wishes she were the hot girl.\n\nI can relate. I\u2019ve wished that, too.\n\nAnd yet I have also experienced the upside of not being a \u201cperfect ten.\u201d As a proud feminist with little desire to diet, get plastic surgery or hire a personal trainer, I have almost no personal experience with men asking me to meetings in their hotel rooms. Those of us in Hollywood who don\u2019t represent an impossible standard of beauty have the \u201cluxury\u201d of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.\n\nI still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise. I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don\u2019t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.\n\nI am entirely aware that these types of choices might feel oppressive to many young feminists. Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?\n\nIn a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want. But our world isn\u2019t perfect. Nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing \u2014 excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can\u2019t be na\u00efve about the culture we live in.\n\nI believe that we can change our culture, but it won\u2019t be something that happens overnight. We live in a society that has treated women as disposable playmates for far longer than Mr. Weinstein has been meeting ing\u00e9nues in luxury hotel rooms.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mayim Bialik"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Opinion | Mayim Bialik: Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s World", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-10-13T10:22:55.000Z", "modified": "2017-10-14T16:52:59.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Weinstein, Harvey", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005493485, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/16adebf6-247e-5081-bdb8-1faa5a0f0e4d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/93a369fa7b7f48698445bba67628769c", "description": "I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry built on the objectification of women.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Mayim Bialik", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Women and Girls,Actor,TV,Women's rights;Feminism,Harvey Weinstein", "pdate": 20171013, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Mayim Bialik: Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s World", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Mayim Bialik as Blossom Russo in season one of \u201cBlossom.\u201d"}, "description": "I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry built on the objectification of women."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Opinion | Mayim Bialik: Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s World", "description": "I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry built on the objectification of women.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Mayim Bialik as Blossom Russo in season one of \u201cBlossom.\u201d"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/16adebf6-247e-5081-bdb8-1faa5a0f0e4d"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/16adebf6-247e-5081-bdb8-1faa5a0f0e4d", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507824000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
