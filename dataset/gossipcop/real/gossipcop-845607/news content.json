Veronika Obeng and her husband Michael from Second Wives Club are the latest victims of the reality TV couples curse.\n\nEven before the premiere of the E! series, the couple had filed for divorce after Veronika discovered Michael having an affair \u2014 and of course, all the drama will play out for millions to see.\n\n\"Watching my life fall apart on TV? Yeah, it sucks,\u201d Veronika told Life & Style exclusively at a What Happens at The Abbey on E! event in LA on May 14. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so much stronger since it was filmed.\u201d\n\nMORE: La La Anthony Shares Touching Tribute to Her Son Amid Split From Carmelo Anthony\n\nOn the second episode, Veronika, who is actually Michael's third wife, begins to have suspicions her plastic surgeon husband is cheating after he gifts her with a plant \u2014 even though he knows she is not a fan of flowers.\n\n\"I'm getting a little concerned because things just seem a little off with Michael. A few years ago, I found out he had an affair,\" she said on the show. \"It was like something changes overnight and you feel connected and then someone's distant. The fact that we survived, you try to find the beauty in that, but I definitely feel some of the signs that I saw before.\"\n\nIt's not long before Veronika's suspicions are confirmed, and she discovers his mistress on a secret Instagram page.\n\nThe couple, who share three children together and five children from previous relationships, filed for divorce in July 2016, and Michael even sued E! to try to stop them from airing the episodes.\n\nMORE: Bethenny Frankel's Mom Not Impressed With Her New 'Shark Tank' Gig \u2014 \"She's a Moron!\"\n\n\"The series was nothing about the couple\u2019s happy marriage as Defendants represented to Plaintiff,\u201d the lawsuit states, according to Variety. \u201cThe Defendants constantly staged Plaintiff in artificial situations and demanded Plaintiff to engage in conflicts that were often fraudulent and deceptive.\u201d\n\nVeronika recently opened up about the split in a blog post and revealed she is ready to move on.\n\n\"Breakups are hard enough. Sometimes as I have learned, just because you have ended a relationship doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still in love with a person,\" she wrote. \"It may mean you had to move on to do what healthy for you.\"\n\nMORE: Enter to Win $1,000 Cash\n\nHowever, she is not ready to starting dating just yet. \u201cNo. I\u2019m married to motherhood right now,\u201d she told Life & Style.\n\nWatch the full clip of Michael and Veronika's awkward exchange below!\n\n", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/veronika-second-wives-club.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ramona-singer-plastic-surgery-2007.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scott-Kourtney-Coparents.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Khloe-Kardashians-Daughter-True-Thompson-Really-Lights-Up-When-Aunt-Kylie-Jenner-Comes-Over.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scott-Disick-and-Sofia-Richie.jpg?crop=0px%2C62px%2C2280px%2C1294px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/True-Thompson-Dream-Kardashian-Cute-Photos-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C125px%2C1080px%2C613px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/veronika-second-wives-club.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Skincare-Routine-Should-You-Try-It-Out-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jack-kelly-osbourne.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Selfie.jpg?crop=199px%2C0px%2C810px%2C810px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Thompson-Already-Loves-Picking-Out-Her-Own-Clothes.jpg?crop=71px%2C393px%2C939px%2C531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10491194ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C179px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-fat-jewish-emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-marriage-exclusive-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/coco-austin-1.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Admits-She-Will-\u2018Never-Come-in-Between\u2019-Tristan-and-Daughter-True-After-Scandal-pp.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/veronika-second-wives-club.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Quintana"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/veronika-from-second-wives-club-132210/", "title": "Veronika From Second Wives Club Catches Husband Cheating Again!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "And just like that cameras ruin another happy marriage.
