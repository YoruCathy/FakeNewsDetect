The Oscar-winning actress was surrounded by her loved ones as she attended a dinner for twelve in her honor at celebrity-haunt Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills on Thursday, July 26. Accompanied by her boyfriend of nearly three years Bryan Randall, the star happily had her 8-year-old son Louis and 5-year-old daughter Laila by her side according to E! News. Of course, the upscale Chinese restaurant was also brimming with Hollywood luminaries.\n\nBirthday girl!
