This is the first Star Wars movie in which original Artoo actor Kenny Baker isn\u2019t involved with the role at all. (While Lucas mostly used radio-controlled props and CGI to bring Artoo to life in the Prequels, Baker was credited in the Prequels.) Jimmy Vee played Artoo in The Last Jedi.\n\n\u2013 In his brief appearance, Artoo guilt trips Luke with Leia\u2019s original hologram message to Obi-Wan Kenobi from A New Hope. The Last Jedi really goes all out in celebrating Carrie Fisher\u2019s legacy!\n\nKylo Ren, Snoke, & The First Order\n\n\u2013 Kylo Ren\u2019s journey continues to inch closer to that of his Legends counterpart, Jacen Solo. While Kylo fell to the dark side as an apprentice, Jacen \u2013 the son of Han and Leia in old EU \u2013 was already a full-fledged Jedi Knight when he became a Sith. Like Kylo, Jacen also consolidated power and took over the galaxy as its new ruler.\n\n\u2013 As revealed in the flashback, Ben Solo\u2019s lightsaber was blue before he turned to the dark side.\n\n\u2013 Unless I missed it, the Knights of Ren are nowhere to be found in this movie. Rian Johnson does away with a few things introduced in The Force Awakens, but this one is one of the more glaring things missing from the movie. I personally would have loved to learn more about them.\n\n\u2013 Like his grandfather before him, Kylo Ren pilots a special TIE fighter during the Resistance evacuation. It\u2019s called the TIE/vn space superiority fighter \u2013 or simply the TIE silencer.\n\n\u2013 An important detail about the First Order is revealed in the opening crawl of The Last Jedi. \u201cThe First Order reigns!\u201d reads the first line of the crawl, which introduces the story to viewers. It was unclear by the end of The Force Awakens what faction ruled the galaxy, but this crawl confirms that the First Order is indeed the ruling body. A few scenes later, General Hux confirms that the New Republic is indeed dead after the destruction of the Hosnian System.\n\nFurther Reading: What The Last Jedi Novel Adds to the Movie\n\n\u2013 The dreadnought that arrives to stop the Resistance from evacuating D\u2019Qar is a Mandator IV-class warship called Fulminatrix armed with 26 cannons and two orbital guns. It is two-and-a-half times the size of a regular First Order Star Destroyer.\n\n\u2013 Supreme Leader Snoke\u2019s Mega-class Star Destroyer is called Supremacy. It\u2019s the only ship of its class in the First Order fleet and served as its flagship. Snoke issued commands from this ship in The Force Awakens while hiding out in the Unknown Regions.\n\n\u2013 Snoke\u2019s throne room is reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine\u2019s, although there\u2019s a stark difference in color scheme. While the Sith Lord preferred black and gray as his colors of choice for outfits and decor, Snoke likes brighter shades. A deep red covers the walls of the throne room and the villain prefers a set of yellow robes over black ones.\n\n\u2013 Snoke shows off quite a few of his Force powers in this movie. At one point, he Force chokes General Hux from a completely different spot in the galaxy. That\u2019s a callback to Darth Vader\u2019s signature move when displeased with his own Imperial lackeys in The Empire Strikes Back. Hux fares better than Admiral Ozzel and Captain Needa. Both villains are able to strangle someone from miles away. In the case of Snoke, the distance seems to be light years.\n\n\u2013 Snoke also uses Force lightning, a power first showcased by Emperor Palpatine.\n\n\u2013 In several of Snoke\u2019s scenes, Emperor Palpatine\u2019s theme can be heard mixed into the score.\n\n\u2013 In fact, the entire torture of Rey in Snoke\u2019s throne room is very reminiscent of Luke\u2019s own confrontation with the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. But while Palpatine means to turn Luke to the dark side, Snoke simply wants to find Luke Skywalker and then kill Rey.\n\nFurther Reading: Why Luke Skywalker\u2019s Legacy Still Matters\n\n\u2013 We don\u2019t learn anything about Snoke\u2019s past in this movie, but we do get to enjoy him make the same mistakes as his evil predecessor. Overconfidence in their apprentices are what get both Palpatine and Snoke killed in the end. Kylo, like his grandfather before him, betrays and kills Snoke.\n\n\u2013 Snoke\u2019s Praetorian Guards are a callback to the Emperor\u2019s Royal Guard from Return of the Jedi. We actually get to see these red badasses in action this time around, though.\n\n\u2013 The eagle-eyed viewer might notice that Snoke is wearing a very unique ring. The stone in that ring is obsidian mined from the volcanic rock underneath Darth Vader\u2019s castle on Mustafar, which was first introduced in Rogue One. The gold in the ring is also engraved with the Four Sages of Dwartii \u2013 a group of controversial philosophers from the early days of the Galactic Republic. Chancellor (and later Emperor) Palpatine had statues of the Four Sages in his office. Shout out to Screenrant for spotting this easter egg first!\n\n\u2013 Captain Phasma returns to face off against Finn. You might be wondering how Phasma managed to escape the trash compactor on Starkiller Base before the superweapon was destroyed by the Resistance. She actually escaped quite simply! You can read all about her post-The Force Awakens adventures here.\n\n\u2013 One of the big topics of discussion surrounding The Last Jedi is the First Order\u2019s ability to track the Resistance through hyperspace. This was previously thought impossible. In fact, the heroes have often used hyperspace to make a quick escape at the last second \u2013 e.g. the Falcon escaping Bespin by reactivating the hyperdrive in The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nFurther Reading: The Empire Strikes Back You Never Saw\n\nWell, Star Wars actually planted the seed for the new hyperspace tracker all the way back in Rogue One (really a year ago, but in Star Wars time\u2026 Well, it\u2019s been more than 30 years). When Jyn Erso is going through the Imperial research files on Scarif, she quickly glimpses at a file for \u201chyperspace tracking.\u201d Indeed, the Empire had been working on this technology way before the First Order perfected it, as confirmed by Lucasfilm Story Group member Pablo Hidalgo.\n\nShout out to EW for spotting this!\n\n\u2013 The astromech droid who first catches on to Finn and Rose\u2019s deception on the Supremacy is named BB-9E. He was first revealed during the release of The Last Jedi toy line. The droids nickname on set was \u201cBB-H8.\u201d I don\u2019t have to explain why that\u2019s funny, right?\n\n\u2013 Continuing the trend of bringing on Game of Thrones actors for cameos in the Sequel Trilogy, Kate Dickie (Lysa Arryn) appears briefly as a communications officer.\n\nLeia & The Resistance\n\n\u2013 This is Carrie Fisher\u2019s final appearance in a Star Wars movie. She died suddenly in late 2016, just a few months after filming had wrapped on The Last Jedi.\n\n\u2013 Leia\u2019s flagship cruiser is called Raddus. The name is a callback to the Mon Calamari admiral who helped Jyn Erso and her group of Rebels steals the Death Star plans during the Battle of Scarif in Rogue One.\n\n\u2013 There\u2019s a lot of precedence for Leia\u2019s surprising Force powers in this movie. While we\u2019ve always known she is Force-sensitive and call feel things through the Force, we\u2019d never seen her use her powers to levitate \u2013 or survive in space for that matter. That said, there have been several instances in the old EU (the Legends timeline) where Leia has directly used the Force. She even joined Luke\u2019s New Jedi Order around the time of the Dark Nest Crisis (from the Dark Nest Trilogy by Troy Denning). Leia was trained by Luke himself and Jedi Master Saba Sebatyne.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s Dark Horse\u2019s Star Wars Infinities series (sort of like DC Elseworlds) where Luke dies on Hoth and it\u2019s up to Leia to face down Vader and the Emperor herself. You can read more about that here.\n\nFurther Reading: How The Last Jedi Asks More of Its Redemption Arc\n\n\u2013 I\u2019ve tried looking up other instances where other Jedi (or Sith) have survived the cold, vacuum of space using the Force but have come up with nothing. Let me know what you find! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in the old EU somewhere\u2026\n\n\u2013 Kelly Marie Tran plays Rose Tico. She is the first Asian-American to star in a Star Wars film.\n\n\u2013 Rose\u2019s ring becomes a significant clue about the galaxy\u2019s future when the final scene of the movie reveals a Force-sensitive boy admiring it on Canto Bight. According to The Last Jedi Visual Dictionary (via Screenrant), that ring was first worn in the halls of the Imperial Senate and the hidden insignia was only revealed among members of the Rebel cause.\n\n\u2013 The Resistance gunner who sacrifices her life to destroy the First Order dreadnought is named Paige Tico, and she is Rose\u2019s sister. Paige is played by Vietnamese actress Veronica Ngo.\n\n\u2013 Finn wakes up in a \u201cbacta suit\u201d (is there an official name for this?), which is a reference to the bacta tank Luke wakes up in after being attacked by the wampa on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back.\n\n\u2013 Gial Ackbar, the Mon Calamari admiral who first appeared in Return of the Jedi (IT\u2019S A TRAP!), finally meets his end during the escape from D\u2019Qar when TIE fighters blow up the Raddus\u2018 bridge. In the Legends timeline, he died peacefully of old age.\n\n\u2013 Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, played by the wonderful Laura Dern, is one of Leia\u2019s oldest friends. They first met at the Apprentice Legislature of the Imperial Senate. You can read more about how they met here.\n\nFurther Reading: Exploring The Last Jedi\u2019s Chase Structure\n\n\u2013 You might be wondering about Holdo\u2019s hair. It\u2019s revealed in Leia, Princess of Alderaan, the young adult novel by Claudia Gray, that she hails from the planet Gatalenta, a peaceful worlds where people meditate and wear very plain clothing. Holdo\u2019s flamboyant style is a rebellion against those traditions.\n\n\u2013 The base the Resistance retreats to on Crait is an old Rebel base that Leia and Holdo first encountered when they were teenagers. Bail Organa, Leia\u2019s adoptive father, had kept the base and his involvement in a Rebellion a secret from Leia. You can read more about all this here.\n\n\u2013 The standoff on Crait is reminiscent of the Battle of Hoth. Both involve walkers, an overwhelmed rebellion trying to escape, and a target that must be destroyed in order for the bad guys to destroy the good guys for good.\n\n\u2013 Several Resistance fighters refer to themselves as \u201crebels\u201d throughout the movie. This is a reference to the Rebellion, of course.\n\n\u2013 The A-wing makes a return in The Last Jedi. This is an updated version called the RZ-2. The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor first appeared during the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi. Fun fact: Shara Bey, Poe Dameron\u2019s mom, flew an A-wing during the Battle of Endor!\n\n\u2013 Speaking of Shara Bey, there\u2019s a direct reference to her in the movie. Poe wears a ring on a necklace during his latest adventure. He\u2019s actually carrying around his mother\u2019s wedding ring!\n\n\u2013 The bombers used by the Resistance to destroy the First Order dreadnought are B/SF-17 heavy bombers. (Another name for these bombers is the MG-100 StarFortress SF-17.) This is their first appearance.\n\nFurther Reading: Exploring the Church of Star Wars\n\n\u2013 C-3PO has a slightly bigger role in this movie \u2013 mostly to annoy Leia and Poe \u2013 and he\u2019s got his golden arm back! He appeared with a rusty red arm in The Force Awakens.\n\n\u2013 The tune you hear as the Millennium Falcon zooms through the Crait mines during the TIE fighter chase scene is definitely a callback to the \u201cTie Fighter Attack\u201d theme from A New Hope. In fact, the way the scene is choreographed, the Falcon zig zagging past obstacles like that, it\u2019s almost meant to look like the Falcon\u2019s run through the Death Star II in Return of the Jedi.\n\n\u2013 Maz Kanata makes a very brief appearance in The Last Jedi in a hologram. We get to see her in action for the first time in this short scene, shooting at her enemies with a blaster. It\u2019s peculiar that she chooses to use a blaster considering that she can use the Force (as revealed in The Force Awakens\u2019 deleted scenes). I hope we can see more of her in Episode IX.\n\n\u2013 Although I thought Temmin \u201cSnap\u201d Wexley died in a fiery X-wing crash during the opening battle, the diligent commenters have corrected me: that\u2019s a dude named Tubbs, played by Jamie Christopher. That\u2019s almost certainly a reference to Porkins from A New Hope.\n\n\u2013 Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher\u2019s daughter, returns once again as Lieutenant Kaydel Ko Connix. She gets a bit more to do this time around, such as help Poe Dameron commit mutiny and take over the Raddus.\n\n\u2013 Nien Nunb, the Sullustan who piloted the Millennium Falcon with Lando Calrissian during the Battle of Endor, makes a brief appearance as part of Poe Dameron\u2019s X-wing squadron. He also appeared in The Force Awakens.\n\n\u2013 In one of the more overt cameos in the movie, Rogue One director Gareth Edwards appears during the Battle of Crait. He can be seen next to the Resistance fighter who tastes the salt on the ground.\n\nPlanets, Other Cameos, & Miscellaneous\n\n\u2013 This isn\u2019t the first Star Wars story to bear the name \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d In the Legends timeline, there\u2019s a novel called The Last Jedi by Michael Reaves and Maya Kaathryn. It\u2019s a continuation of the Coruscant Nights trilogy, which stars a Jedi Knight named Jax Pavan in the days after Order 66.\n\n\u2013 Even though you never actually hear the famous Star Wars line, \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this,\u201d it is in the movie, according to director Rian Johnson. He revealed to Huffington Post that it\u2019s actually BB-8 who says it to Poe during their crazy attack on the Dreadnought.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a fun character to deliver that line,\u201d Johnson told HuffPo. \u201cI think originally I had Poe respond, \u2018Oh, I got a good feeling about it. Keep your chin up.\u2019 And then I made it a little less explicit just to make it more fun.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The little ornament Luke finds on the Falcon and later gifts to Leia is Han\u2019s lucky dice. The smuggler believes they bring him good luck, so he hangs the ornament in the ship\u2019s cockpit. He even used the dice to beat Lando Calrissian in a game of \u201cCorellian Spike,\u201d an offshoot of the card game sabacc, and win the Millennium Falcon!\n\nIn reality, Han\u2019s dice only appear ONCE in the entire Original Trilogy. Inexplicably, they disappear after one shot in the movie. They finally return in The Force Awakensand are given a bit more attention in The Last Jedi.\n\nFurther Reading: The Identity of Rey\u2019s Parents Could Change in Episode IX\n\n\u2013 From what I can tell, the charred Darth Vader helmet doesn\u2019t make an appearance in this movie. It seems kind of odd that we never see Kylo Ren talking to it considering it was such a big part of his faith in the dark side in The Force Awakens. Perhaps that\u2019s part of his whole \u201cKill the past\u201d slogan in The Last Jedi. As far as I can tell, the last we saw of the helmet, it was on the Finalizer and not Starkiller Base, so it wouldn\u2019t have blown up, right?\n\n\u2013 There is a lot to learn about Canto Bight in the recently released novel collection. It\u2019s a corrupt place where the rich control the police department. You can read way more fun facts about the planet here.\n\n\u2013 The Force-sensitive boy who works in the fathier stables in Canto Bight is named Temiri Blagg, played by Temirlan Blaev. You can read way more about him here.\n\n\u2013 Temiri\u2019s friends are named Arashell Sar (Sarah Heller) and Oniho Zaya (Josiah Oniha).\n\n\u2013 Canto Bight is located on the desert planet called Cantonica. Yes, it\u2019s a desert planet! How does Canto Bight have that body of water surrounding it and that huge waterfall? That\u2019s an artificial body of water constructed to make Canto Bight look even more lavish.\n\n\u2013 Warwick Davis, who played Wicket the Ewok in Return of the Jedi, has a brief cameo as an alien in Canto Bight named Wodibin. Davis has cameod in quite a few other Star Wars projects, too.\n\n\u2013 The \u201cspace horses\u201d located on Canto Bight are called fathiers. They were actually first mentioned in the novel Aftermath: Empire\u2019s End by Chuck Wendig, misspelled as \u201cfaithiers.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading: The Best Ships in The Last Jedi\n\n\u2013 The Master Codebreaker Maz Kanata recommends for Finn and Rose\u2019s secret mission to deactivate the First Order\u2019s hyperspace tracker is played by Justin Theroux in a cameo role. He seems to be really good as \u201cspace craps.\u201d Hit me up if you know what game the Master Codebreaker is actually playing on Canto Bight.\n\n\u2013 Frequent Rian Johnson collaborator Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a brief cameo. He voices a character named Slowen Lo. According to Steve Wheeler in the comments, \u201cThe character Slowen Lo voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a reference to the Beastie Boys song \u2018Slow and Low.\u2019 There was a character called Ello Asty in The Force Awakens in reference to the Beastie Boys album Hello Nasty and J.J. Abrams used \u2018Sabotage\u2019 in Star Trek (2009) and it was later repeated in Star Trek Beyond (2016).\u201d Thanks for the Beastie Boys knowledge, Steve!\n\n\u2013 The space yacht DJ and BB-8 steal in order to escape Canto Bight is called the Libertine.\n\n\u2013 When DJ is going through the different ships the Canto Bight arms dealer sold to the First Order, we see holograms of the TIE bomber and TIE Interceptor.\n\n\u2013 The extreme close-up of the iron landing on the First Order officer uniform is a reference to the short film Hardware Wars, which itself is a parody of A New Hope.\n\n\u2013 The \u201ccrystal foxes\u201d on Crait are actually called vulptices. (The singular is \u201cvulptex.\u201d) You can read more about the vulptex here.\n\n\u2013 Apparently, filmmakers Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish also have cameo roles in the movie, but I\u2019ve not spotted them. Let me know if you do!\n\n\u2013 There were rumors that Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) would also have a cameo, but that\u2019s not been confirmed. He apparently played a stormtrooper.\n\n\u2013 Prince Harry and Prince William of the British royal family reportedly filmed cameos. No sight of them just yet, though.\n\n\u2013 British singer Ellie Goulding revealed on Twitter that she filmed a cameo in The Last Jedi. I\u2019ve not spotted her, though.", "images": ["https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi.jpg?fit=1000%2C500", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi.jpg?resize=768%2C432", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/11952784_10153679224247859_4721332076776667920_o.jpg?resize=80%2C80&filter=grayscale"], "top_img": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi.jpg?fit=1000%2C500", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Saavedra", "Don Kaye", "Michael Ahr", "Rosie Fletcher", "David Crow", "Rob Leane", "Alec Bojalad"], "canonical_link": "https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-easter-eggs/", "title": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi Easter Eggs and Reference Guide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d23226", "description": "A complete list of easter eggs, references, and callbacks we found in Star Wars: The Last Jedi!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi Easter Eggs and Reference Guide | Den of Geek", "description": "A complete list of easter eggs, references, and callbacks we found in Star Wars: The Last Jedi!", "url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-easter-eggs/", "site_name": "Den of Geek", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi.jpg?fit=1000%2C500", "secure_url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi.jpg?fit=1000%2C500", "width": 1000, "height": 500}}, "article": {"tag": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi", "section": "Movies", "published_time": "2018-12-14T23:00:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A complete list of easter eggs, references, and callbacks we found in Star Wars: The Last Jedi!", "title": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi Easter Eggs and Reference Guide | Den of Geek", "image": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi.jpg?fit=1000%2C500"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/favicon.geek_.purple.swirl_-1.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544828400.0, "source": "https://www.denofgeek.com", "summary": ""}
