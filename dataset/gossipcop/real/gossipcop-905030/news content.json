The 6,500-strong British Academy of Film and Television Arts tossed a lot of love towards titles with UK-centric stories and/or pedigrees while embracing Guillermo del Toro\u2019s lyrical fantasy The Shape Of Water. The Fox Searchlight film, for which del Toro won the Directing Golden Globe on Sunday, scored a leading 12 nominations.\n\nThe group entirely snubbed Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Post, a serious and timely Oscar candidate, giving it zero mentions. (Is it notable that the American story walked away from Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes empty-handed, despite a gag at the top of the show that anticipated a sweep?)\n\nBlade Runner 2049, a critically-lauded movie that nevertheless faltered, also appears to be a favorite with BAFTA voters (the film\u2019s biggest offshore box office market is the UK). When Denis Villeneuve\u2019s name was listed among Best Director nominees this morning, there was cheering from the press corps at 195 Piccadilly in London. The Sony/Alcon sci-fi sequel otherwise largely scored nods in the tech categories with a total of eight mentions.\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus: BAFTA In Talks With Distributors About 2021 Eligibility Flexibility\n\nWarner Bros\u2019 Dunkirk from Christopher Nolan also scored eight nominations including Best Film and Director along with tech nods. Working Title/Focus\u2019 Darkest Hour, which follows Winston Churchill against the backdrop of the crisis faced on the beaches at Dunkirk, has nine mentions including in the Best Film, Best British Film, Leading Actor and Supporting Actress fields. Gary Oldman as Churchill is seen as the frontrunner this awards season while this is the first major nomination for Kristin Scott Thomas in Darkest Hour.\n\nEric Fellner, co-chief of Working Title which nabbed a total 12 noms today, says of Darkest Hour, \u201cThe name I see on all of these nominations is Joe Wright\u201d who did not score a directing bid. For Fellner, \u201cA film can\u2019t get this kind of recognition without a brilliant creative visionary at the head of it, that was our director.\u201d\n\nIn a bit of trivia, Scott Thomas last won a BAFTA in 1995 for Four Weddings And A Funeral, the same year that Hugh Grant also last won, and for the same film. He\u2019s nominated for Supporting in Paddington 2 this time around, the box office smash that\u2019s got further nods for Adapted Screenplay and Best British Film.\n\nAlthough set in the U.S. midwest, Fox Searchlight\u2019s nine-time BAFTA nominee Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri was co-financed by the UK\u2019s Film4 and is written and directed by the British/Irish filmmaker Martin McDonagh. He scored nods today while the movie was also recognized in the Best Film, British Film, Cinematography, Supporting Actor and Actress races. It scooped the Globe on Sunday in the drama category, and also picked up Best Actress for Frances McDormand, among other wins. McDormand is also nominated at BAFTA but, in a surprise, won\u2019t be up against Judi Dench for Victoria And Abdul, with that film scoring just one BAFTA mention today for Hair & Make-Up.\n\nEntering the Leading Actress BAFTA race is Annette Bening for Film Stars Don\u2019t Die In Liverpool, another title with a British background that also picked up a surprise Leading Actor nod for Jamie Bell who last won in 2001 for Billy Elliot.\n\nBAFTA Chief Executive Amanda Berry says more British films were entered this year and points out that eight of the 20 performance nominees are British, repping a higher number than in recent memory.\n\nThe BAFTA\u2019s faced some criticism last year for a perceived lack of diversity among its nominees. Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound was shut out this year, and the conversation might turn around a lack of female directors in the main category. Berry says, however, that BAFTAs new talent schemes are seeing increasing diversity. \u201cChange is definitely happening.\u201d There are also, she notes, five female directors nominated in categories outside the main field including in Outstanding Debut. Greta Gerwig\u2019s awards favorite Lady Bird earned her an Original Screenplay nomination, but it failed to impact the Director or Film categories, collecting only two further nods, for Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf.\n\nSays Fellner, \u201cI think we should all try harder to find more opportunities for women to direct more movies. That is something we are going to continue to do at Working Title and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to see that in the industry.\u201d\n\nIn other notable categories, the Foreign Language race includes 2017\u2019s Globe winner Elle and Oscar winner The Salesman as well as this year\u2019s shortlisted Loveless. In the Documentary race, National Geographic scored its first ever BAFTA Film nomination for Jane.\n\nSee here for the full list of nominees.
