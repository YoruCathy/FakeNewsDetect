She said the two stayed in touch \u201cfor a while\u201d after she left the mansion in 2009.\n\n\u201cI was still going back to some of the parties. Occasionally, my boyfriend [Nick Carpenter] and I would go back,\u201d she said. \u201cI was still in touch with Hef \u2014 and then we kind of lost contact.\u201d\n\nA rep for Hefner did not immediately return Fox News\u2019 request for comment. He married 31-year-old Playmate Crystal Harris in 2012.\n\nMarquardt has also been dealing with other personal woes. The model received unwanted news after she and Carpenter thawed her eggs, which she had frozen nine years ago.\n\n\u201cNone of my eggs survived,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt was devastating for me. All this time I thought I had an amazing insurance policy, but it didn\u2019t work out. I thought I was doing the smart thing and the right thing, and I do still think it was. It just didn\u2019t work out for me.\u201d", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=142", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-85369821.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-85369821.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-85369821.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fox News", "July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/07/10/bridget-marquardt-hasnt-seen-hugh-hefner-in-years/", "title": "Bridget Marquardt hasn\u2019t seen Hugh Hefner in years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
