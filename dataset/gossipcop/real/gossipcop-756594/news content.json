The account, @onionringsworldwide, seemed fairly new, with only four posts and 24 followers, including Lorde and a number of her friends.\n\nWhile @onionringsworldwide, whose bio read, \u201cEvery onion ring I encounter, rated\u201d, only had four posts, those four posts each gave plenty of clues leading back to Lorde, according to this 17-year-old fan. Like any good food Intagrammer, each caption included the name of the restaurant said onion ring was acquired from, and a review of the ring. That alone, plus knowing where Lorde is on her promotional tour (and knowing the look of her nails?), helped the fan build a strong case that this account was actually run by Lorde.\n\nEven more evidence that this account was run by non-Royal Lorde? Newshub reached out to her management and they didn\u2019t respond. Instead? The account has since been deleted.\n\nNewshub contacted Lorde\u2019s management to ask whether Lorde likes onion rings, whether she prefers a light batter on her onion rings, and whether she runs the account.\n\nManagement had not responded at the time of writing, but shortly after questions were sent through, we\u2019re sad to report the onionringsworldwide account was removed from Instagram.\n\nA few things about this: A) why does it matter if she secretly runs this innocent account? It\u2019s not going to effect her popularity. Why are they treating this like she ran a pro-life Instagram? B) why didn\u2019t her management give a statement or respond at all to Newshub? C) She reviewed a Burger King onion ring, and that just seems like a lost cause.\n\nListen, if Lorde wants to have some semblance of normality in her life, let her just have an anonymous account, maintaining it while she flies private between Bonaroo and Bev Hills. But she can\u2019t be the only celeb who has a secret social media account, right? I don\u2019t know for sure, but here are my best guesses as to what type of accounts these famous people are managing under the shroud of internet secrecy.\n\nEDIT: LORDE IS ON JIMMY FALLON AS I\u2019M WRITING THIS AND SHE CONFIRMED IT WAS HER ACCOUNT.\n\nShe said, \u201cI sort of naively didn\u2019t realize it would be a thing.. it was like a good past time\u2026 I deleted it because now people are going to be throwing onion rings (at me) on tour\u2026 I don\u2019t think they get enough credit for how delicious they are.\u201d\n\nUgh. Well, I\u2019m guessing fans are still going to throw onion rings at you. But enjoy this post anyways.\n\nTaylor Swift // Bughead Tumblr\n\nWhen Taylor is active on her official Tumblr, it\u2019s actually her and she knows how to use those hashtags, so it would only make sense if she had another Tumblr. I imagine she\u2019s one of those hardcore shippers on the site, maybe for Riverdale, specifically for OTP Bughead aka Betty and Jughead. It\u2019s mainly a fanfic site, but she\u2019ll RB a gifset or two \u2013 maybe even featuring her own song lyrics.\n\nKylie Jenner // LOL GOP Twitter\n\nThe guy who spent 6 years demanding a birth certificate is so sick of witch hunts. \u2014 LOLGOP (@LOLGOP) June 15, 2017\n\nI have no doubt Kylie can be savage af, but it would delight me to no end if she was super into politics and anti-GOP to the core enough to run this account.\n\nZooey Deschanel // Miniature Food on YouTube\n\nIt\u2019s just so twee, just like Zooey\u2019s whole aesthetic.\n\nAdam Scott // Fat Jewish-esque Instagram\n\nIf you follow Adam Scott on Twitter, you know two things about him: 1) he\u2019s not afraid to say how much trump sucks balls. 2) he is ridiculous and absurdly funny. I will never forget this dumb peanut butter and jelly joke that lasted lit\u2019rally two years. So it\u2019s not entirely out of his realm to run a comedy/meme account on Instagram.\n\nRosie O\u2019Donnell // Toy Review on YouTube\n\nWe love Rosie. We loved her talk show. As tweens, we were enamored with her love for not only kids like us, but she had a kidlike quality that enabled her to constantly shoot koosh balls in the audience without it being awkward or gimmicky. Plus she loves a good nostalgia item, so these reviews of old toys would be right up her alley.\n\nBJ Novak // His Teen Sister\u2019s Twitter\n\nWalking around with a phone charger looking for an outlet is probably the closest I'll ever get to knowing what it's like to be a guy \u2014 Keough A.F. Novak (@KeoNovak) February 10, 2015\n\nWell, OK, this is actually true. BJ has been running an account under the name \u201cKeough Novak\u201d, who is supposedly his snarky teen sister. I started following her years ago, when I noticed that BJ\u2019s BFF/Soup Snake Mindy Kaling had been tweeting at her a lot. I obvs stalked her profile and thought she was funny, and it wasn\u2019t until like 2 years later that I found out that BJ had been running the account with his two brothers \u2013 I grew suspicious after realizing she wasn\u2019t getting older an was a perpetual 16 year old. BJ said of the account, \u201cIf I have a thought that\u2019s superficial or immature, that\u2019s a good thing for Keough to say.\u201d Not only that, but HE DOESN\u2019T EVEN HAVE A SISTER. Lies. Deceit. Hilarity too. Bless.\n\nKanye West // Slime Shop on Instagram\n\nHe may have quit Twitter, but for a guy who calls Steve Jobs one of his idols, I hardly believe he\u2019s completely off social media. Plus, given his love for art, and creativity, I can picture him making these popular slime videos \u2013 and perhaps even selling tubs of them out of their Bel-Air mansion.\n\nBarack Obama // Secret Snapchat\n\nIn general, he just has a secret Snapchat account. Followers include Malia, Sasha, Joe Biden and Jay Z (who also has a secret account).", "images": ["https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/lisa-frank.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhBQdkADqUQ/VJsg5r8MJrI/AAAAAAAABVE/j_9uU_R3HbQ/s1600/email.jpg", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/insta-icon.png", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tnc.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/fnl-screening.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://tracileigh27.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/twitter-icon_edit1.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2017/06/is-this-lorde-s-secret-onion-ring-instagram-account/_jcr_content/par/image.img.full.high.jpg/v0.jpg", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/onion-rings.jpg?w=749", "http://myrottingbrain.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/vlcsnap-2011-04-22-00h31m08s154.png?resize=200%2C200", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k-z2kcTxsJg/VoePGPP_9uI/AAAAAAAABd8/7hxR7JUSdX0/s1600/Polaroid_2016.jpg", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/harding.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://s1.wp.com/i/badges/freshly-pressed-circle.png", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/test-header_circle.jpg", "https://tracileigh27.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/facebook-icon_edit1.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2017/06/is-this-lorde-s-secret-onion-ring-instagram-account/_jcr_content/par/image_1627135154.img.full.high.jpg/v0.jpg", "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/trw_no.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://tracileigh27.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/tumblr-icon_edit1.png"], "top_img": "https://cookiesandsangria.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/onion-rings.jpg?w=749", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://cookiesandsangria.com/2017/06/16/onion-ring-instagrams-and-other-secret-celebrity-accounts/", "title": "Onion Ring Instagrams and Other Secret Celebrity Accounts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "U_T-5igUC7VTrJEByEZqf_7VsIi3v5nWYli_cd0Ff8c", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Onion Ring Instagrams and Other Secret Celebrity Accounts", "url": "https://cookiesandsangria.com/2017/06/16/onion-ring-instagrams-and-other-secret-celebrity-accounts/", "description": "Celebrities, they\u2019re just like us.
