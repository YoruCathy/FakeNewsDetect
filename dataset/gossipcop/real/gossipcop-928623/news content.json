The news came shortly after Chance the Rapper shared a clip of Kanye announcing that their upcoming collaborative album will be titled Good Ass Job. Earlier this month, Kanye also teased the existence of Watch the Throne 2 on Twitter. Considering the Chicago rapper already put out two albums this year\u2014June\u2019s ye solo project and Kids See Ghosts with Kid Cudi\u2014the news has taken many fans by surprise.\n\nWith announcements from West coming at a rapid clip, Genius put together a comprehensive breakdown of what we know about each project and what to expect from the Chicago rapper in the next few months.\n\nYandhi\n\nKanye\u2019s next album Yandhi is on its way before the end of the month. Last night, he revealed what\u2019s seemingly a release date for the project: Saturday, September 29. Although this doesn\u2019t line up with the music industry standard of Friday releases, it does coincide with his appearance as the musical guest on the season premiere of Saturday Night Live.\n\nHe also shared what seems to be the project\u2019s cover art. It\u2019s reminiscent of the minimalist artwork for his 2013 album Yeezus, which, along with the title, has led many to believe that Yandhi will be a sequel or spiritual successor to Yeezus. The artwork is a purple MiniDisc, an audio media format that experienced its greatest popularity in the mid-1990s.\n\nTalk of a Yeezus sequel is hardly new. Rick Rubin first told NewsWeek in 2013 that Yeezus 2 \u201cmight be\u201d seeing a release date at some point after he insisted on splitting what was originally a 16-track album into two parts. He further elaborated on the possibility in a Genius annotation:\n\nLast November, Genius discovered that CyHi The Prynce\u2019s personal Spotify account contained a playlist of Yeezus 2 songs, further confirming that it existed at some point. However, in the five years since Yeezus dropped, it seems likely that Kanye has released or repurposed at least some of that material. As such, it\u2019s unclear if anything on Yandhi will be drawn from the long-fabled Yeezus 2 music.\n\nKanye\u2019s other 2018 releases all ran exactly seven songs, a trend he could be continuing with his latest release. However, we currently don\u2019t know who is involved with the album or how long it might be. His recent singles \u201cXTCY\u201d and \u201cI Love It\u201d with Lil Pump are potential candidates for inclusion, as is the G Herbo and Ronny J collaboration he recently teased on Instagram:\n\nYoung Thug also teased his involvement in the project:\n\nGood Ass Job\n\nBack in July, Chance the Rapper first announced that he would be linking up with Kanye West in Chicago to work on Chance\u2019s next album. Kanye was since spotted in Chicago doing exactly that, and on Monday night, Chance shared a video clip of Kanye announcing that the project is titled Good Ass Job. \u201cMe and Chance [are] working on a new album. It\u2019s called Good Ass Job. I love you guys very much. We need to go to the studio,\u201d West said.\n\nAlthough we already knew that the project was in the works, the title Good Ass Job makes things more interesting. Kanye first announced in a 2003 interview with MTV that his fourth album, released after Graduation, would be titled Good Ass Job. He ended up releasing 808s & Heartbreak instead, but brought the title back as the \u201ctentative\u201d first name for the 2010 album that would eventually become My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\n\nSince then, Kanye had seemingly moved away from using the Good Ass Job title. Chance, however, has shown a keen interest in it for years. After using the phrase on his breakout mixtape Acid Rap, Chance rapped the words \u201cgood ass job\u201d on 2016\u2019s \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d his first collaboration with Kanye:\n\nI made Sunday Candy, I\u2019m never going to hell\n\nI met Kanye West, I\u2019m never going to fail\n\nHe said, \u201cLet\u2019s do a good ass job with \u2018Chance 3\u2019\u201d\n\nI hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy\n\nLater that year, he told Beats 1 that he was trying to connect with Kanye for a project titled Good Ass Job. Now, it seems that Chance\u2019s vision is finally coming to fruition. Considering the title was originally Kanye\u2019s, it\u2019s unclear if he will rap on the album or just do production work. Good Ass Job is slated to be seven songs in length, but its release date and contents are currently unknown.\n\nWatch the Throne 2\n\nKanye West and JAY-Z\u2019s joint album Watch the Throne remains the stuff of rap legend, and now it seems there\u2019s some kind of sequel in the works. Kanye first announced the news with a simple tweet:\n\nThere\u2019s been very little news about the project thus far, although a pair of Instagram posts from Kanye further hinted at Jay\u2019s involvement:\n\nJay\u2019s relationship with Kanye has been strained for the past few years, following Kanye calling out Jay and Beyonc\u00e9 during a now-infamous rant at the Sacramento stop of his Saint Pablo tour. Since then, Jay has addressed Kanye on songs like \u201cKill Jay Z,\u201d \u201cLOVEHAPPY,\u201d and \u201cFRIENDS.\u201d Kanye also split with TIDAL over withheld royalty payments last year. The two rappers haven\u2019t been spotted together at all in recent years, although Jay said earlier this year that Kanye is still \u201clike a brother\u201d to him.\n\nIf Jay for some reason isn\u2019t involved in the album, it\u2019s unclear why Kanye would call it Watch the Throne 2. It\u2019s possible that the project is an album-length collaboration with another artist, much like Kids See Ghosts or the original Watch the Throne. At this time, however, not much is known.", "images": ["https://loadus.exelator.com/load/?g=4&j=0&p=1183&page-album_ids=%5B221981%5D%2C%5B462441%5D&page-albums=Good+Ass+Job%2CYandhi&page-artist_ids=%5B2%5D%2C%5B72%5D%2C%5B16751%5D%2C%5B27794%5D&page-artists=JAY-Z%2CKanye+West%2CChance+the+Rapper%2CRick+Rubin&page-type=article&user_signed_in=false", "https://images.genius.com/6f40713d3c3b09ac4b4352cf49416666.700x654x1.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=201983886890479&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://i.genius.com/d867b9b1378779c4aaa154d1bf3f4470fadbc067?url=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com%2Fvp%2Fd0d187bb0505327436415b435c702c79%2F5C1B73FE%2Ft51.2885-15%2Fe35%2F41743654_554273438326473_7694494300718208760_n.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17151659&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.genius.com/67f8220eb471a6e29b36884a1f142b961cffa966?url=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com%2Fvp%2Fa3dfd79889cba4d746b8662c4d3263da%2F5C2BB04F%2Ft51.2885-15%2Fe35%2F41214760_684666791913058_7158275076573246025_n.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-f3CPQ6vHckedE.gif"], "top_img": "https://images.genius.com/6f40713d3c3b09ac4b4352cf49416666.700x654x1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://genius.com/a/here-s-everything-we-know-about-all-of-kanye-west-s-upcoming-albums", "title": "Here\u2019s Everything We Know About All Of Kanye West\u2019s Upcoming Albums", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=709482991", "y_key": "f63347d284f184b0", "og": {"site_name": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/a/here-s-everything-we-know-about-all-of-kanye-west-s-upcoming-albums", "title": "Here\u2019s Everything We Know About All Of Kanye West\u2019s Upcoming Albums", "description": "\u2018Yandhi,\u2019 \u2019Watch the Throne 2,\u2019 & \u2018Good Ass Job\u2019 are all in the works.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f40713d3c3b09ac4b4352cf49416666.700x654x1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 265539304824, "pages": 308252472676410}, "twitter": {"url": "https://genius.com/a/here-s-everything-we-know-about-all-of-kanye-west-s-upcoming-albums", "title": "Here\u2019s Everything We Know About All Of Kanye West\u2019s Upcoming Albums", "description": "\u2018Yandhi,\u2019 \u2019Watch the Throne 2,\u2019 & \u2018Good Ass Job\u2019 are all in the works.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f40713d3c3b09ac4b4352cf49416666.700x654x1.jpg", "site": "@Genius", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Genius"}, "id": {"iphone": 709482991}, "url": {"iphone": "genius://articles/5953"}}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://genius.com", "summary": ""}
