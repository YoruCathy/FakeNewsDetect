And when Dodd, now 72, confirmed that she was \u201cdrunk as a skunk\u201d in the picture, Johansson knew she had to meet her and \u201csee your drunk face.\u201d\n\nThursday night, she finally got to see it.\n\n\u201cSo she came last night to the \u2018Rough Night\u2019 premiere, and we did get kind of trashed,\u201d Johansson said.\n\nAlso Read: How Scarlett Johansson's 'Rough Night' Became the Rare Studio Comedy That's LGBT-Friendly\n\nThe actress doesn\u2019t plan on making it a one-night stand with her lookalike, gushing to Colbert about how nice she was \u2014 and calling her a \u201clush\u201d in an endearing way. She said she\u2019d like to visit Dodd\u2019s home as well.\n\n\u201cI will eventually make my to Arkansas and continue this lovely family reunion,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s just awesome.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/johansson.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/scarlett-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/march.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rough-night-dom-DF-19244_R_rgb-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/johansson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Pressberg", "Matt Donnelly", "Reid Nakamura", "Ross A.
