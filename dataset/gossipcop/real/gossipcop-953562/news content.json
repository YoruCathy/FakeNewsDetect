Focus Features and Universal Pictures International are distributing the film around the world.\n\nThe show\u2019s Oscar-winning creator Julian Fellowes wrote the film\u2019s screenplay and is set to produce the picture alongside Carnival Films\u2019 Gareth Naeme, Liz Trubridge, and executive producer Nigel Marchant. The Book Thief filmmaker Brian Percival, who helmed the show\u2019s pilot episode, will direct. Plot details are still under wraps.\n\nAcross six seasons of its original run, Downton Abbey \u2014 set in the wealthy Crawley family\u2019s country estate as it followed their intricate lives as well as those of the servants they employed at the turn of the 20th century \u2014 garnered a steady international following and sustained critical acclaim. It won three Golden Globes and 15 Emmys on top of 69 total nominations over the years.\n\n\u201cWhen the television series drew to a close it was our dream to bring the millions of global fans a movie and now, after getting many stars aligned, we are shortly to go into production,\u201d Naeme said of the film via press statement. \u201cJulian\u2019s script charms, thrills and entertains and in
