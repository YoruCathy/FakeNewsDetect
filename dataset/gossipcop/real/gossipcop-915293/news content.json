And that felt like a lost opportunity. When the show was at its height, they spent two episodes looking at how all the characters on that show felt about abortion.\n\nThe episodes that I talked about with D.J., Roseanne's son, and racism, they spent a whole episode exploring how he might have come to feel that way and how Roseanne and Dan may have unwittingly contributed to that.\n\nThe discuss that we saw in this new \"Roseanne\" was basically a series of sort of jabs and insults traded between two characters. They didn't take a lot of time to sort of investigate how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she felt or how other people in her family may have felt about it. A lot of it was implied.\n\nAnd I noticed when I tried to talk to the cast about this, when I tried to talk to Roseanne about this back in January, that they were a little hesitant to talk about the political implications of what they were doing and why they were making the choices that they were making to make Roseanne a Trump supporter in the first place.", "images": ["https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/07/canvas-promo.png", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/03/newsletter-politics-1024x684.jpg", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/04/2020-04-07T160931Z_1640666070_RC2SZF9G729L_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-BRITAIN-ANTIBODIES-425x283.jpg", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/bnsf-railway.png", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/04/rosanne3-e1522797956453-1024x565.jpg", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/consumer-cellular.png", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/03/coronavirus-background.png", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/mutual-of-america.png", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/raymond-james.png", "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/cpb-footer-trans.png"], "top_img": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/04/rosanne3-e1522797956453-1024x565.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pbs Newshour"], "canonical_link": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/roseanne-revival-hits-a-nerve-by-tapping-the-political-divide", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019 revival hits a nerve by tapping the political divide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "\u201cRoseanne\u201d is back after a two-decade-long hiatus, winning high ratings and critical acclaim, as well as criticism.
