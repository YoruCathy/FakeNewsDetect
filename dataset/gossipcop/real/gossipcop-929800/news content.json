The fifth episode of season 9 of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d revealed that she left the Hilltop with the mysterious Georgie during the big time jump that came at the end of Rick Grimes\u2019 (Andrew Lincoln) final episode. But she will be back.\n\nCohan, meanwhile, left \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d during season 9 after an ABC pilot she filmed, \u201cWhiskey Cavalier,\u201d was picked up by the network, and also after a contentious contract dispute in which she demanded equal pay with her male co-stars who had been on the show as long as as she had. Presumably, that\u2019s why Maggie just kinda disappeared instead of getting any kind of sendoff.\n\nSo Cohan left \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d to try new things. Lauren Cohan later addressed the situation again in similarly ambiguous terms, saying that \u201cthere may have been some conversations\u201d about her return to \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d but that we\u2019ll have have to wait and \u201csee what happens.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Walking Dead': Everything We Know, and Think We Know, About Georgie\n\nThat all probably felt like it was coming totally out of left field, considering how casually Maggie left the show last season. Her final episode also being Rick\u2019s last didn\u2019t help, since the episode basically functioned as Rick\u2019s death episode. Maggie, on the other hand, just kinda wasn\u2019t around anymore after that one, with only a couple mentions of where she went in subsequent episodes.\n\nBut Maggie is coming back. \u201cWhiskey Cavalier\u201d was canceled, and I guess Cohan and the powers that be at AMC have settled their dispute some way or another. At New York Comic-Con last year, AMC announced both that \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d was renewed for season 11 and that Cohan would return for that season.\n\nBut now, it turns out that Maggie will make her return in the current season, season 10. \u201cWe may see her at some other point this season,\u201d Kang told Entertainment Weekly, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to say too much about anything.\u201d\n\nWell, after the most recent episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d we got a tease for the season 10 finale which showed, as we all would have expected by now, that Maggie will finally make her return in the next episode. You can watch that tease here.\n\nAlso Read: Danai Gurira's 'Walking Dead' Exit Scores Largest Audience Since Season 10 Premiere\n\nBut the coronavirus pandemic might have thrown a wrench into this whole situation. AMC said last week that Angela Kang and co. are not able to finish the season 10 finale of \u201cThe Waking Dead\u201d at the moment, so the current run of episodes will end at the 15th episode of the season. The finale will air eventually \u2014 we just don\u2019t know when. So her return will happen in the next episode, whenever it ends up airing.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s long been theorized that the helicopter that carted Rick away belongs to the same group that we believe Georgie hails from \u2014 the Commonwealth, an actual large city of people in Ohio. If that theory pans out, and Georgie\u2019s people are also the helicopter\u2019s people, then there\u2019s also plenty of reason for Rick and Maggie to cross paths in this new corner of the \u201cWalking Dead\u201d universe \u2014 perhaps during the big six-year time skip that we got in season 9.\n\nBut everything remains shrouded in mystery. If Georgie actually is with the Commonwealth, then Maggie\u2019s return will be conveniently timed because the beginning of the Commonwealth story in the comics was intertwined with the end of the Whisperer plot, and at this point there\u2019s no reason to think the Whisperers stuff will continue after the season 10 finale.\n\nAlso Read: 'Walking Dead': Let's Talk About That Cellphone, and Other Clues Michonne Found\n\nSo, at least this won\u2019t be a Heath (Corey Hawkins) situation \u2014 remember how he went out scavenging with Tara and then just never came back, his fate still undetermined? Maggie will be back. It\u2019s just a matter of time now until it happens.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-walking-dead-twd-leaders-ranked-negan-jadis-governor-rick.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-jayne-atkinson-georgie-everything-we-know-about-her-maggie-commonwealth-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/twd-walking-dead-movie-danai-gurira-michonne--160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-twd-lauren-cohan-are-we-ever-gonna-see-maggie-again.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-Walking-Dead-World-Beyond-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/twd-the-walking-dead-michonne-danai-gurira-final-episode-interview-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-twd-lauren-cohan-are-we-ever-gonna-see-maggie-again.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen", "Reid Nakamura", "Ross A.
