The SUV was sideswiped by another car, causing the vehicle to spin and flip over. The \u201cAnchorman\u201d star was one of three passengers in the vehicle. He did not suffer any significant injuries and witnesses said he was awake and on his phone when paramedics took him away from the scene, TMZ reports.\n\nAccording to CBS News, the actor was in the San Diego area to promote youth turnout in the midterm elections, reprising the role of Ron Burgundy as part of Funny Or Die and Billy Eichner\u2019s \u201cGlam Up The Midterms.\u201d", "images":
