Blac Chyna took to Instagram on Sunday, April 23, to share a video of herself showing off her best dance moves while celebrating her BFF Treasure\u2019s baby shower.\n\nIn the video, the Lashed Bar entrepreneur, 28, and Treasure \u2014 who fans met last year on season one of E!\u2019s Rob & Chyna \u2014 bounce up and down as they shake their hips to French Montana and Swae Lee\u2019s \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d While Chyna, dressed in a cream crop top with matching trousers, busts a move, Treasure cradles her baby bump during their mini dance break.\n\nI love my bestie @1badbish !!! Baby Shower Vibes ?

As previously reported, the Arthur George sock designer, 30, and the model, who share 5-month-old daughter Dream, went to TAO in L.A. for a romantic dinner date.\n\nChyna posted a video of Kardashian putting his hand on her thigh, while she rested her hand on top of his. While they may have appeared to be getting along better than ever, the makeup maven, who also shares son King Cairo, 4, with ex-fianc\u00e9 Tyga, was not wearing the 7-carat engagement ring with which Kardashian proposed in April 2016.\n\nHowever, Chyna recently told Cosmopolitan South Africa that she and the once-reclusive reality star have been attending therapy to work on their sometimes volatile relationship. \u201cI\u2019m in it for the long haul, so I feel like my advice [for anyone in a similar situation] is therapy, know each other\u2019s family, calling each other\u2019s moms,\u201d she told the magazine in March. \u201cI know we love each other and we\u2019re fighting for each other, and the people we surround ourselves with are rooting for us.\u201d", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/652218624_blac-chyna-zoom-268852db-29ee-4b9a-9a53-1c3da327a5db.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/652218624_blac-chyna-zoom-70feb2be-f18c-468d-9e81-6728234d7c3e.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/652218624_blac-chyna-zoom-268852db-29ee-4b9a-9a53-1c3da327a5db.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blac-chyna-dances-while-celebrating-bff-treasures-baby-shower-w478526/", "title": "Blac Chyna Dances While Celebrating BFF Treasure\u2019s Baby Shower", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Blac Chyna took to Instagram to share a video of herself showing off her best dance moves while celebrating her BFF Treasure\u2019s baby shower \u2014 watch the clip here", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blac Chyna Shows Off Her Dance Moves While Celebrating BFF\u2019s Baby Shower", "description": "Blac Chyna took to Instagram to share a video of herself showing off her best dance moves while celebrating her BFF Treasure\u2019s baby shower \u2014 watch the clip here", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blac-chyna-dances-while-celebrating-bff-treasures-baby-shower-w478526/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:11:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/652218624_blac-chyna-zoom-268852db-29ee-4b9a-9a53-1c3da327a5db.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/652218624_blac-chyna-zoom-268852db-29ee-4b9a-9a53-1c3da327a5db.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-24T18:37:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:11:45+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Blac Chyna took to Instagram to share a video of herself showing off her best dance moves while celebrating her BFF Treasure\u2019s baby shower \u2014 watch the clip here", "title": "Blac Chyna Shows Off Her Dance Moves While Celebrating BFF\u2019s Baby Shower", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/652218624_blac-chyna-zoom-268852db-29ee-4b9a-9a53-1c3da327a5db.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493059020.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
