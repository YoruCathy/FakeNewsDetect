Competitors will push their bodies to the limit by battling opponents in innovative and unforgiving head-to-head challenges, designed by Johnson. Winners will advance to the ultimate challenge of Mt. Olympus, the consummate athletic test of speed, strength, agility and endurance. In each episode the male and female competitors who conquer Mt. Olympus will become a Titan.\n\n\u201cThe Titan Games\u201d will not only test the competitors\u2019 physical strength, but also their mental and emotional fortitude. In the end, the Titans will return to battle against one another, with one man and one woman emerging as Titan Champion and each winning a grand prize of $100,000.\n\n\"The Titan Games\" is produced by A. Smith & Co. Productions in association with Universal Television Alternative Studio and Seven Bucks Productions.
