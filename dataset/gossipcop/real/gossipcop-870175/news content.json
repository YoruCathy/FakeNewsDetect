Jackson (@parisjackson) on Jul 28, 2017 at 11:23pm PDT\n\nMacaulay, 36, and Paris, 19, got matching spoon tattoos on their arms.\n\nSuch designs often symbolize a continuing struggle. Macaulay and Paris did not explain the meaning behind their new tattoos.\n\nWith a totally new look, the Home Alone actor was spotted walking in Hollywood with Paris Jackson, the daughter of his friend, the late Michael Jackson.\n\nThe two of them went into a tattoo parlor. Paris looked at the photographers as they headed to the tattoo parlor.\n\nThe two of them have occasionally hung out before. In 2016, Paris posted on Instagram photos of the two hanging out. During one visit, she gave the actor a pedicure.\n\nmodel? nah i paint hipsters toenails for a living. A post shared by Paris-Michael K. Jackson (@parisjackson) on Dec 17, 2016 at 6:14pm PST\n\n\u2018Model? Nah I paint hipsters toenails for a living,\u2019 she wrote.\n\nMichael, who died at age 50 in 2009, was friends with Macaulay for years.\n\nThe actor appeared in the singer\u2019s 1991 music video Black or White and visited his Neverland Ranch several times as a kid with his family.\n\nAs you may recall, Culkin worried all his fans back in 2012 when photos surfaced of him looking rail-thin, tired and gaunt.\n\nOver the years, his image rarely changed, and he continued to spark conversation about his well-being, including speculation over whether he was heavily using drugs.\n\nThe actor responded to all of this in an interview last year, denying the allegations and noting that people don\u2019t really have a right to be concerned about him, considering his separation from the spotlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now, he is back in the spotlight and he is looking greater than ever. His fans can chill down as he seems very healthy and he also managed to put on some weight.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Beyonce\u2019s-Flawless-Post-Baby-Body-Her-Nutritious-Diet-Exercising-Secrets-Finally-Revealed-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1280_garcelle_beauvais_jamie_foxx_GettyImages-171509406-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Paris-Jackson-CBS8.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Macaulay-Culkin-Joins-The-Cast-Of-American-Horror-Story-Season-10-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Paris-Jackson-prince-jackson-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mike-Pence-Donald-Trump-Deborah-Birx-Andrew-Cuomo--300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tiny-harris-daughter-zonnique-pullins-shows-off-her-gym-look-and-fans-love-it-300x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Macaulay-Culkin-Paris-Jackson-Head-To-Tattoo-Parlor-To-Get-Matching-Tattoos.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Macaulay-Culkin-Paris-Jackson-Head-To-Tattoo-Parlor-To-Get-Matching-Tattoos.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/macaulay-culkin-paris-jackson-head-to-tattoo-parlor-to-get-matching-tattoos-55783/", "title": "Macaulay Culkin & Paris Jackson Head To Tattoo Parlor To Get Matching Tattoos", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "macaulay culkin, paris jackson,", "keywords": "celebrity news, macaulay culkin, paris jackson,", "description": "Macaulay Culkin who has recently showcased a fresh new healthy look and his goddaughter Paris Jackson got matching tattoos on Saturday.
