The DC Entertainment series, which hails from Warner Bros. Television, was axed in May. An episode count for the new season has yet to be determined.\n\nThis isn't the first time the streaming giant has picked up a canceled show from the Time Warner-owned studio. Netflix previously revived Warner Horizon's Longmire after A&E axed the series. The two companies are also in business together on the Kiernan Shipka starrer Sabrina, a Riverdale offshoot. (Riverdale, meanwhile, remains a monster hit on Netflix, which has SVOD rights after originals air on The CW.)\n\nLucifer joins Brooklyn Nine-Nine as the second Fox series to be canceled this season and move to another outlet (the latter was saved by NBC). The decision to drop both Brooklyn and Lucifer \u2014 neither of which were owned by Fox \u2014 comes as the network is undergoing a dramatic shift amid its studio counterpart\u2019s pending sale to Disney (or Comcast). Gone are niche comedies like Brooklyn and narrow dramas like Lucifer as Fox plots a shift to broader audiences with a slate of procedurals and multicamera comedies including Tim Allen\u2019s Last Man Standing. (The latter was revived at Fox \u2014 whose 20th TV owns the series \u2014 a year after it was canceled at ABC.)\n\nLucifer never really set the ratings afire. In its third season, it averaged a 1.3 rating among adults 18-49 and nearly 5 million viewers once all live-plus-7 lifts were factored in. Its live tune-in was a limp 0.8 rating in the key demo, and not for a lack of attempts to give it a fighting chance on the network\u2019s part. Lucifer aired alongside such power players as the original X-Files revival and Gotham.\n\nNetflix revived the DC Comics-inspired drama after a massive fan campaign. Season three ended on a cliffhanger, with creator Joe Henderson tweeting out that the axing \"fucking hurts\" and that he was sorry for frustrating \"the hell out of you fans.\" Series star Tom Ellis, for his part, tweeted that he was \"gutted\" by the cancellation. \"It fills me with great sadness to confirm the rumours that some of you have been asking. Fox has indeed cancelled #lucifer I\u2019m so sorry guys,\" the actor wrote at the time.\n\nLucifer was one of multiple series to have the proverbial rug pulled out from beneath it amid Fox\u2019s creative shift. Established shows and pilots continue to move beyond their initial homes as the Peak TV era offers more choices where one outlet\u2019s miss is another\u2019s hit. It also is worth noting that Netflix didn't even have the SVOD rights to Lucifer \u2014 Hulu did \u2014 meaning that deal had to be reworked, similar to the way Amazon recently revived Syfy\u2019s The Expanse after having to renegotiate SVOD rights as the first three seasons were sold to Netflix.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/11/netflix.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/04/lesley_goldberg.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/05/Lucifer_Still.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/01/greg_berlanti_sharon_horgan_alex_kurtzman_and_dwayne_johnson_-_getty_-_h_2020.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/lucifer_s03e01_still_embed.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2017/09/lucifer_s03e01_still_embed.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/03/mrs._america_-_publicity_still_1-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/lucifer_s03e01_still_embed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryn Elise Sandberg Lesley Goldberg", "Bryn Elise Sandberg", "Lesley Goldberg", "Bryn.Sandberg Thr.Com", "Lesley.Goldberg Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lucifer-revived-at-netflix-fox-cancellation-1120632", "title": "'Lucifer' Revived at Netflix After Fox Cancellation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Netflix has greenlighted a fourth season of 'Lucifer' following Fox's cancellation.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lucifer-revived-at-netflix-fox-cancellation-1120632", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Lucifer' Revived at Netflix After Fox Cancellation", "description": "The streaming giant has picked up the fantasy drama for a fourth season.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/09/lucifer_s03e01_still_embed.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Lucifer' Revived at Netflix After Fox Cancellation", "description": "The streaming giant has picked up the fantasy drama for a fourth season.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/lucifer-revived-at-netflix-fox-cancellation-1120632", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/lucifer_s03e01_still_embed.jpg", "width": 928, "height": 619, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Lucifer' Revived at Netflix After Fox Cancellation", "sailthru.description": "The streaming giant has picked up the fantasy drama for a fourth season.", "sailthru.author": "Bryn Elise Sandberg,Lesley Goldberg", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-15 13:30:00", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, Netflix, Warner Bros.
