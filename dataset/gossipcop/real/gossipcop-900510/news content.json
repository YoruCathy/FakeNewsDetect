The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\n\nGlenn Close: \u2018I\u2019m Angry\u2019\n\nIn a statement to The Times, Ms. Close said that she felt \u201cangry and darkly sad,\u201d and that while Mr. Weinstein had been decent with her, she had heard rumors of inappropriate behavior toward women over many years.\n\nHer full statement:\n\nI\u2019m sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumors that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women. Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumors are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad. I\u2019m angry, not just at him and the conspiracy of silence around his actions, but also that the \u201ccasting couch\u201d phenomenon, so to speak, is still a reality in our business and in the world: the horrible pressure, the awful expectation put on a woman when a powerful, egotistical, entitled bully expects sexual favors in exchange for a job. Ours is an industry in which very few actors are indispensable and women are cast in far fewer roles than men, so the stakes are higher for women and make them more vulnerable to the manipulations of a predator. I applaud the monumental courage of the women who have spoken up. I hope that their stories and the reportage that gave them their voices represents a tipping point, that more stories will be told and that change will follow. The changes must be both institutional and personal. Men and women, in positions of power, must create a work environment in which people, whose jobs depend on them, feel safe to report threatening and inappropriate behavior, like that reported in the Times. No one should be coerced into trading personal dignity for professional success. I feel the time is long and tragically overdue for all of us in the industry, women and men, to unite \u2014 calmly and dispassionately \u2014 and create a new culture of respect, equality and empowerment, where bullies and their enablers are no longer allowed to prosper.\n\nKate Winslet: \u2018Disgraceful and Appalling\u2019\n\nIn a statement to Variety, Ms. Winslet said that Mr. Weinstein\u2019s \u201cbehaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong. I had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been na\u00efve. And it makes me so angry. There must be \u2018no tolerance\u2019 of this degrading, vile treatment of women in any workplace anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nMs. Winslet won a best actress Oscar in 2008 for her role in \u201cThe Reader,\u201d which was released by the Weinstein Company.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/arts/10meryl1/10meryl1-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/arts/10meryl1/10meryl1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/arts/10meryl1/10meryl1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cara Buckley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/movies/dench-close-streep-weinstein.html", "title": "Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Glenn Close Speak Out on Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-10-09T14:37:48.000Z", "modified": "2017-10-12T16:25:19.000Z", "section": "Movies", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/cara-buckley", "tag": "Weinstein, Harvey", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005486279, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/60e2b28c-ed40-51b8-9cf6-209166d5d4d6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/0e745dc9085a4f9e8f02934393147587", "description": "Ms. Streep called the news about Mr. Weinstein \u201cdisgraceful\u201d but added, \u201cNot everybody knew.\u201d Her statement seemed to open the floodgates.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/arts/10meryl1/10meryl1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Cara Buckley", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/arts/10meryl1/10meryl1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Movies,Sexual harassment,Weinstein,Meryl Streep,Harvey Weinstein", "pdate": 20171009, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/movies/dench-close-streep-weinstein.html", "type": "article", "title": "Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Glenn Close Speak Out on Harvey Weinstein", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/arts/10meryl1/10meryl1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes in January.
