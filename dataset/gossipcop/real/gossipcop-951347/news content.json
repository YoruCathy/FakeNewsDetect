(Does that mean she\u2019s retiring that famous Alexander McQueen dress she got plenty of use out of during last awards season?)\n\nTheater all-star Lin-Manuel Miranda went low-key with his appreciation for the nomination for a guest turn on \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm,\u201d referencing the show\u2019s famous catchphrase and calling himself, \u201cPretty, pretty, pretty grateful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay tuned for more celebrity reactions throughout the day.\n\nOVERJOYED to be nominated for an #Emmy for when I hosted @nbcsnl!!
