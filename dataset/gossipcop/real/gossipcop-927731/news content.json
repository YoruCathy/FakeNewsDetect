Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian loves her new role as a mom to daughter True Thompson, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 is absolutely obsessed with True, and is up with the baby in the middle of the night whenever she cries,\u201d the source explains. \u201cKhloe does have a nanny, but she is hardly working because Khloe is so hands-on.\u201d\n\nThe insider adds that the 33-year-old reality star has been \u201cvery emotional because she didn\u2019t ever think she would become a mother, and considers True to be a miracle.\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Kardashian gave birth to her first child with Tristan Thompson at a hospital in Cleveland on April 12. Four days later, the Revenge Body host announced her daughter\u2019s name and revealed her baby girl weighed 6 pounds, 13 ounces at birth.\n\n\u201cOur little girl, True Thompson, has completely stolen our hearts and we are overwhelmed with LOVE,\u201d Kardashian captioned a photo of pink decorations on Monday, April 16. \u201cSuch a blessing to welcome this angel into the family! Mommy and Daddy loooooove you True!\u201d\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has opened up in the past about her desire to start a family. \u201cBeing pregnant has always been a dream of mine,\u201d she tweeted back in March. \u201cEven though 9 months feels like a lifetime while I\u2019m awaiting the arrival of my baby girl, it\u2019s really a blink in the grand scheme of life.\u201d\n\nTwo days before Kardashian and Thompson welcomed baby True, footage emerged of the Cleveland Cavaliers star appearing to kiss and go to a hotel with another woman. Us Weekly confirmed on Friday, April 13, that the basketball pro has been unfaithful with multiple women since at least November.\n\nMembers of the Kardashian family have yet to publicly comment on the cheating scandal.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloe-kardashian-hands-on-mom.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1705px%2C894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloe-kardashian-hands-on-mom.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1705px%2C963px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloe-kardashian-hands-on-mom.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1705px%2C894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/khloe-kardashian-is-hands-on-with-baby-true/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Is \u2018Hands-On\u2019 With Baby True", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Khloe Kardashian is \u2018obsessed\u2019 with her newborn daughter, True Thompson, and is a very \u2018hands-on\u2019 mom, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively\u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Is \u2018Hands-On\u2019 With Baby True", "description": "Khloe Kardashian is \u2018obsessed\u2019 with her newborn daughter, True Thompson, and is a very \u2018hands-on\u2019 mom, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively\u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/khloe-kardashian-is-hands-on-with-baby-true/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-18T22:20:37+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloe-kardashian-hands-on-mom.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1705px%2C894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloe-kardashian-hands-on-mom.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1705px%2C894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-04-18T21:54:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-18T22:20:37+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Khloe Kardashian is \u2018obsessed\u2019 with her newborn daughter, True Thompson, and is a very \u2018hands-on\u2019 mom, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively\u2014 get the details", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Is \u2018Hands-On\u2019 With Baby True", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloe-kardashian-hands-on-mom.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1705px%2C894px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524088482.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
