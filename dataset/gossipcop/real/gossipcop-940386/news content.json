But he's far from just a prolific actor with rugged good looks and a winning smile\u2014he\u2019s also an Oscar-winning director, a staunch supporter of independent films, and a devoted conservationist. Find out more about the living legend below.\n\n1. Robert Redford used to work at Yosemite National Park.\n\nWhen an 11-year-old Robert Redford was recovering from a mild case of polio in 1949, his mother took him to visit Yosemite National Park. He was immediately blown away by it, and later returned to apply for a job there. For two summers, he worked at Camp Curry\u2014now called Curry Village\u2014and Yosemite Valley Lodge, and spent his free time immersing himself in the natural wonders of the park. \u201cIt gave me a chance to really be there every day\u2014to hike up to Vernal Falls or Nevada Falls,\u201d he told Smithsonian.com. \u201cIt just took me really deep into it. Yosemite claimed me.\u201d In 2016, Redford got a chance to virtually return to his boyhood playground by narrating the documentary National Parks Adventure, which explores Yosemite and many other American National Parks.\n\n2. Robert Redford earned a baseball scholarship to the University of Colorado.\n\nAs a boy, Redford had a natural aptitude for anything athletic, and sports were a main focus of his childhood (along with reading, which his parents both encouraged). In addition to track, tennis, and football, he grew up playing baseball, which eventually earned him a scholarship to the University of Colorado\u2014but it didn\u2019t last very long. \u201cI became the campus drunk and blew out before I could ever get going,\u201d Redford told People in 1998. He either dropped out or was expelled during his sophomore year (there are differing accounts), then relocated to Europe, where he spent a year and a half learning about art, culture, and politics from contemporaries in France and Italy. \u201cI was living with a bunch of bohemians, highly politicized, and I'd be challenged by students about my country and I didn't know what they were talking about,\u201d he told The Guardian. When he returned to the U.S., he made a concerted effort to stay up to date on national goings-on.\n\n3. Robert Redford has been married twice.\n\n\n\nRobert Redford and Sibylle Szaggars at the Cannes Film Festival in 2013. Andreas Rentz/Getty Images\n\nUpon his return to Los Angeles, Redford met a 17-year-old bank teller from Utah named Lola Van Wagenan, who lived in his building. The two married in 1958, moved to New York City, and went on to have four children before divorcing amicably in 1985. In the late 1990s, Redford began seeing German-born painter Sibylle Szaggars, though he predicted he\u2019d never marry again. \u201cI have to be careful in terms of never saying never, but I don\u2019t think I would go there again,\u201d he told People in 1998. He was right to be wary of saying \u201cnever\u201d\u2014the couple tied the knot in 2009.\n\n4. Robert Redford\u2019s early adulthood was marked by tragedy.\n\nRedford\u2019s mother, Martha Hart Redford, died suddenly from septicemia\u2014a bacterial infection in the bloodstream\u2014in 1955, when the future Oscar winner was 18 years old. \u201cWhen I look back on it now, I realize she was the one person who believed in me throughout,\u201d Redford said in an interview. Just four years later, Redford and his first wife, Lola, lost their 5-month-old son, Scott, to sudden infant death syndrome. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s been easy for me,\u201d Redford told People. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to live with. It\u2019s so untrue.\u201d\n\n5. Robert Redford considers his kids to be his greatest achievement.\n\n\n\nRobert Redford pictured with his son, Jamie, and daughter-in-law, Kyle, in 2009. Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nThree of Redford\u2019s children ended up with careers in the arts: Shauna became an artist, Jamie took up screenwriting, and Amy pursued acting. Redford considers them his ultimate success. \u201cI've made some interesting movies, and I've been very satisfied with the work, but if someone wrapped it all up and said to me, \u2018What's your greatest achievement?\u2019 I'd say, \u2018The children. They're the best thing in my life,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n6. Robert Redford got his start on Broadway.\n\nAfter moving to New York, Redford enrolled at Brooklyn\u2019s Pratt Institute with a plan to learn how to design theater sets. But it soon became clear that he was much better suited to being on stage rather than behind the scenes. During an acting class at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Redford impressed his teacher with a scene from Arthur Miller\u2019s All My Sons, and something clicked. \u201cSuddenly, I had support for something that was very raw, but felt good to me,\u201d Redford told The Washington Post in 2005. He abandoned his design classes to study acting at the Academy instead, and in 1959 he performed in two Broadway plays: Tall Story and The Highest Tree.\n\n7. Barefoot in the Park was Robert Redford\u2019s big break.\n\nRedford continued to perform plays in the early 1960s: Little Moon of Alban in 1960, Sunday in New York in 1961, and Barefoot in the Park in 1963. A few years after his first credited film role\u20141962\u2019s War Hunt\u2014Redford got to reprise his most recent Broadway character in the film adaptation of Barefoot in the Park, acting opposite the already well-established Jane Fonda (coincidentally, Fonda had starred in the movie versions of both Tall Story and Sunday in New York). It premiered in 1967 to generally positive reviews, and Redford\u2019s portrayal of the well-to-do\u2014and almost inconceivably handsome\u2014Paul Bratter catapulted him to a much higher level in the Hollywood stratosphere.\n\n8. Robert Redford is notoriously late.\n\nIf you\u2019re running late to a meeting with Robert Redford, don\u2019t panic: he\u2019s likely running even later than you are. \u201cTo a person, the colleagues and friends interviewed for this article predicted that Redford would not be on time and that the only question was by how much,\u201d Ann Hornaday wrote for The Washington Post in 2005. (He was late\u2014by nearly an hour.) \u201cHe\u2019s been late all his life,\u201d the late Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in multiple films, told her. When asked about his own reputation for tardiness, Redford grinned and responded, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about it. It\u2019s a myth.\u201d\n\n9. Out of all his films, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is Robert Redford\u2019s favorite.\n\nConsidering that Redford has built a veritable business empire on the word Sundance, it\u2019s probably not altogether surprising that his character from 1969\u2019s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is especially dear to him\u2014in part because it was so much fun to shoot. \u201cI love to ride, I like doing the stunts,\u201d Redford said in 2011. \u201cAnd Paul [Newman] and I had a great relationship that just evolved in the making of the film.\u201d\n\n10. Robert Redford and Paul Newman liked to give each other gag gifts.\n\nRedford and Newman paired up again for 1974\u2019s The Sting, and the two remained close friends until Newman\u2019s death in 2008. Their relationship was playful both on- and offscreen, and the pals were known to prank each other from time to time. Once, Newman gifted Redford a pillow embroidered with the adage \u201cPunctuality is the courtesy of kings,\u201d poking fun at Redford\u2019s habitual tardiness. For Newman\u2019s 50th birthday, Redford wrapped up an old junkyard Porsche\u2014a nod to Newman\u2019s penchant for auto racing\u2014and delivered it to Newman\u2019s back doorstep. Newman then deposited it in the middle of Redford\u2019s living room. Determined to have the last laugh, Redford had the beat-up automobile made into a garden sculpture, which he set in Newman\u2019s yard.\n\n11. Robert Redford almost turned down The Way We Were.\n\nFilmmakers were pushing hard for Robert Redford to star alongside Barbra Streisand in 1973\u2019s The Way We Were, but he wasn\u2019t keen on Hubbell Gardiner, a character he thought was too one-dimensional to be anything more than a \u201cKen doll\u201d for Streisand\u2019s Katie Murosky to fall in love with. After extensive script revisions, Redford finally felt that Hubbell was flawed enough to be interesting, and signed on to play the role. He did, however, have one additional concern. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to sing, is she?\u201d he asked director Sydney Pollack, referring to Streisand. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a musical.\u201d It wasn\u2019t, but Streisand did sing one rather memorable track for the film: \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d which won both Best Original Song at the Oscars and Song of the Year at the Grammys in 1974.\n\n12. Robert Redford was already interested in making a movie about Watergate while the scandal was still unfolding.\n\nRedford didn\u2019t just play Bob Woodward in 1976\u2019s All the President\u2019s Men\u2014he was instrumental in making sure the movie happened in the first place. In 1972, more than a year before Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, Redford called Woodward and asked to meet about a potential film. Woodward was wary, and even considered the possibility that it was a prank\u2014or worse, someone working in Nixon\u2019s White House\u2014but Redford eventually succeeded in discussing the project with him and fellow Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein. Though no decisions were made for a couple more years, when Bernstein and Woodward published their book, All the President\u2019s Men, in 1974, they sold the rights to Redford.\n\n13. Robert Redford founded the Sundance Institute right after winning his first Oscar.\n\nToday, Redford is one of the world\u2019s most famous champions of independent filmmaking, but back in 1981, he was still a novice filmmaker who had just nabbed his first (and only) Oscar for directing his first film, Ordinary People. Almost immediately after the win, he founded the Sundance Institute, an organization that supports independent films. \u201cI\u2019ve always had this personal theory that at just the moment of the highest achievement, you should stop and go back to zero and not take anything for granted,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only reason he decided to devote his resources to indie projects. Cable, home video, and then-new blockbuster franchises like Superman and Star Wars were rapidly changing the landscape of the film industry in the late 1970s, and Redford was thinking ahead about what that might mean for less established artists. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, that's OK, the film business is a broad one, but is that going to be at the expense of more humanistic films?\u2019 And I felt that it would be.\u201d\n\n14. Robert Redford convinced the author of A River Runs Through It to let him adapt it for film.\n\nIn 1976, Norman Maclean published A River Runs Through It and Other Stories, a semi-autobiographical collection of tales about his upbringing in early 20th-century Montana, which garnered literary acclaim and piqued the interest of Hollywood filmmakers. But Maclean held onto the rights, reluctant to hand the reins to people who likely wouldn\u2019t let him have much say in the adaptation of his work. Redford, on the other hand, promised to consult with the author and his family throughout the whole process, and Maclean agreed. Unfortunately, Maclean didn\u2019t live long enough to see the final result; he passed away in 1990, and the Redford-directed film\u2014starring a young up-and-comer named Brad Pitt\u2014didn\u2019t hit theaters until 1992.\n\n15. Robert Redford was friends with Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\n\nWhen Redford invited Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez to lead a Spanish-speaking lab at the Sundance Institute, the renowned author of One Hundred Years of Solitude suggested a deal\u2014he\u2019d visit Sundance if Redford would come with him to Cuba, which Redford agreed to do. During their vacation in Havana, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez introduced the actor to Che Guevara\u2019s widow, who sold him the rights to her late husband\u2019s memoir The Motorcycle Diaries. The film adaptation, produced by Redford and directed by Walter Salles, was released in 2004, and Jorge Drexler\u2019s \u201cAl Otro Lado del Rio\u201d clinched an Oscar for Best Original Song.\n\n16. Barack Obama awarded Robert Redford the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.\n\n\n\nRobert Redford receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama presented Redford with America\u2019s highest civilian honor for his contributions as an actor, director, producer, and conservationist. Redford wasn\u2019t the only member of the cultural elite to receive the award that year: Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks, Bruce Springsteen, Diana Ross, Ellen DeGeneres, and Lorne Michaels were also honored, as were Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael Jordan. When asked what was going through his mind during the ceremony, Redford told C-SPAN that he wished his parents were alive to see it. \u201cI don\u2019t think either one of them saw this coming,\u201d he said with a chuckle.\n\n17. Robert Redford may or may not be retired from acting.\n\nWhile promoting the release of 2018\u2019s The Old Man & the Gun\u2014which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy\u2014Redford confessed that he was ready to hang up the acting hat he\u2019d been wearing for 60 years. \u201cNever say never, but I pretty well concluded that this would be it for me in terms of acting,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly that August. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, that\u2019s enough.\u2019 And why not go out with something that\u2019s very upbeat and positive?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing Redford qualified his statement with a \u201cNever say never,\u201d because he took it back the following month. \u201cI think it was a mistake to say that I was retiring because you never know,\u201d he told People at the New York premiere of the film in September.", "images":
