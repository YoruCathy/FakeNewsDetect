How did she mark her come back? With an Instagram post dedicated to her BFF's in girlband, HAIM on the release of their new song, 'Want You Back'. Naturally, the Instagram photo was a screenshot of the song playing on her phone (much like when Lorde released 'Green Light') and it was stopped on 0:13secs. Not exactly a coincidence when she has been known to make it very obvious in the past that 13 is her lucky number. That said, it's nice to see the squad leader back on social media.\n\nOn. Repeat. Til. The. End. Of. Time. @haimtheband A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) onMay 3, 2017 at 8:25pm PDT\n\nBut will she stick around?\n\nTheory #1: She\u2019s Living A Quieter Life.\n\nBack in March, police arrested a man for burglary, stalking and trespassing in Taylor\u2019s apartment. A criminal complaint stated that the guy turned up at least four times in the past two months.\n\nWhilst we really hope that it\u2019s not the reason she\u2019s been living a quieter life, we don\u2019t blame her for wanting to take a small break.\n\nTheory #2: She\u2019s Exhausted.\n\nJust us or did her 1989 world tour seem to go on FOREVER? Thus, we\u2019re not really surprised that she wanted a bit of downtime.\n\nTheory #3: She\u2019s Pulling An Ed Sheeran.\n\n\u2018An Ed Sheeran\u2019: When a popstar goes in hiding for a period of time before coming back and releasing ALL the music and getting ALL the number ones.\n\nSee also: Adele.\n\nTheory #4: She\u2019s In The Studio.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise us if she had built a studio in her apartment so she has no reason to leave the house. Much like other artists, perhaps she is locking herself away from the world to focus on her next album. An album of which her BFF, Ed Sheeran, hinted that we could be getting around Christmas time.\n\nAnd according to sources, we might not be too far off the jackpot with this theory as apparently she is now recording new music! They commented that \"Taylor has been writing and recording her new album in Nashville for the last several months. She has been working on it quietly around the clock and will be making an announcement soon. She is really excited about her new music and can't wait to share it with her fans. She has been entirely focused on that and not much else. She has been 100% dedicated to making music the last few months and that's it\".\n\nNEW TAYLOR SWIFT MUSIC?! YES. PLEASE.\n\nTheory #5: She\u2019s Gone Missing.\n\nSome fans are seriously concerned about Taylor\u2019s absence from all things to do with life and are even speculating that she\u2019s gone missing. Oh, and that her record label is currently looking for a clone to replace her.\n\nTheory #6: She\u2019s Still Mourning The Hiddleswift Break-Up.\n\nOthers think that ex boyfriend Tom Hiddleston is the reason that we haven\u2019t heard much from Taylor recently. Perhaps she\u2019s sticking to her lyric \u201cwe are never ever getting back together\u201d and is now seeing someone new that she wants to keep hidden from the world.\n\nTheory #7: She\u2019s The Founder Of The Church Of Satan.\n\nOkay, we\u2019re sorry but this one is surely the most ridiculous nonsense ever?!\n\nRumour has it that Taylor Swift (in this case, the clone) was created in order to get more people into the Church of Satan. Taylor Swift was born in 1989, and Schreck (the person that Taylor is meant to be a clone of) left the church in 1990.\n\ncan we talk about how taylor swift really fckn look like zeena lavey....? \u2014 beby (@baecteria) January 5, 2017\n\nI fully support the theory that #taylorswift is a clone of a former satanic priestess Zeena LeVey. \u2014 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043a (@fag_plague) January 19, 2017\n\nHere\u2019s the video that everyone is basing speculation on:\n\nYou May Also Like...", "images": ["https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/16/taylor-swift-back-in-febuary-1492702232-custom-0.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAHoAAABBCAYAAAAe5LCKAAAAoklEQVR4Ae3QMQEAAADCoPVPbQZ/iEBhwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwIABAwYMGDBgwMA9MHwpAAE4XV0CAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://static.capitalfm.com/assets_v4r/dist/gusto/img/google-play-badge.svg", "https://mediaweb.musicradio.com/player/image.aspx?i=///mediaweb.musicradio.com/artwork/ses/80c200b8-e5b4-481e-b9d1-a8f371577c99&h=144", "https://static.capitalfm.com/assets_v4r/dist/gusto/img/app-store-badge.svg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAABkAQMAAABKLAcXAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAANQTFRF2NjY5QlMowAAABNJREFUGBljGAWjYBSMglFAVwAABXgAAdxFAhsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/16/ed-sheeran-leaving-taylor-swifts-apartment-1492701823-custom-0.jpg", "https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-at-the-grammys-2016-1486031735-list-handheld-0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-at-the-grammys-2016-1486031735-list-handheld-0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Meadway"], "canonical_link": "https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/news/disappeared-new-music-2017/", "title": "Taylor Swift MIA: 7 Legit(ish) Theories To Explain Where The Popstar Has Disappeared To", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Capital FM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=297652751", "pubdate": "2017-05-05T14:37:48", "modified": "2017-05-05T14:54:12", "description": "WHERE IS SHE?!", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "taylor, swift, mia, explain, theories, legit, ish, disappeared, popstar, radio, fm, dab", "parsely-link": "https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/news/disappeared-new-music-2017/", "parsely-section": "/artists/taylor-swift/news/", "parsely-title": "Taylor Swift MIA: 7 Legit(ish) Theories To Explain Where The Popstar Has Disappeared To", "parsely-author": "Katie Meadway", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-at-the-grammys-2016-1486031735-list-handheld-0.jpg", "parsely-post-id": 159646, "parsely-pub-date": "2017-05-05T14:37:48", "og": {"url": "https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/news/disappeared-new-music-2017/", "site_name": "Capital", "domain": "www.capitalfm.com", "description": "WHERE IS SHE?!", "title": "Taylor Swift MIA: 7 Legit(ish) Theories To Explain Where The Popstar Has Disappeared To", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-at-the-grammys-2016-1486031735-list-handheld-0.jpg", "height": 360, "width": 640}}, "twitter": {"site": "@CapitalOfficial", "url": "https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/taylor-swift/news/disappeared-new-music-2017/", "description": "WHERE IS SHE?!", "title": "Taylor Swift MIA: 7 Legit(ish) Theories To Explain Where The Popstar Has Disappeared To", "image": "https://assets.capitalfm.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-at-the-grammys-2016-1486031735-list-handheld-0.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.tags": "artists, taylor-swift, news, disappeared-new-music-2017", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-05 14:37:48", "fb": {"admins": "551351399,1191061720,506268272,629227116,508902591,544850136,669788254,647915822,516067336,621995612,677149409,61310422,638591731,648380633,621995612,531059714,272200002", "app_id": 184899318222048, "page_id": 113220942069573, "pages": 113220942069573}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKqcAME45hQ?enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1493966268.0, "source": "https://www.capitalfm.com", "summary": ""}
