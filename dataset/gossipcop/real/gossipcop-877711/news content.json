A statement released by Kensington Palace on Twitter reads, \"Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news.\" Kate's morning sickness was also mentioned in the statement, as an explanation for her absence at upcoming events: \"As with her previous two pregnancies, the Duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. Her Royal Highness will no longer carry out her planned engagement at the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London today. The Duchess is being cared for at Kensington Palace.\"\n\nA little brother or sister for George and Charlotte isn't entirely unexpected. During a trip to Poland earlier this summer, after being gifted a toy for a newborn, Kate reportedly joked, \"We will just have to have more babies!\" And there's plenty of room at Kensington Palace, since Prince William and Princess Kate recently added a huge, three-story extension to the royal residence in preparation for their move there from Amner Hall. The renovation proposal claimed that the nearly 5,000-square-foot expansion would \"free up the palace suites for the Royal Family\" and is \"required to allow for the accommodation of administration which must necessarily be moved out of rooms leased from the Royal Household in Kensington Palace.\" It would also free up a ton of space for a new nursery and multiple playrooms\u2014just saying.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1503077583/glamour_newlyweds-recreate-their-parents-wedding-photos.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park", "Andrea Par"], "canonical_link": "http://www.glamour.com/story/prince-william-first-comments-princess-kate-third-pregnancy", "title": "Prince William Says Princess Kate's Pregnancy With Their Third Child Is 'Very Good News'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "At a mental health conference on Tuesday, Prince William said he and Kate are \"celebrating\" now, after her third pregnancy was \"a bit anxious to start with.\"", "id": "59aea662497b9d6ef5941480", "keywords": "celebrity gossip,snd,prince william,princess kate,kate middleton", "news_keywords": "celebrity gossip,snd,prince william,princess kate,kate middleton", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59aea662497b9d6ef5941480", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"At a mental health conference on Tuesday, Prince William said he and Kate are \\\"celebrating\\\" now, after her third pregnancy was \\\"a bit anxious to start with.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "But now they're starting to celebrate the happy news.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Prince William Says Things Were 'a Bit Anxious' at the Start of Kate's Third Pregnancy", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.glamour.com/story/prince-william-first-comments-princess-kate-third-pregnancy"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "But now they're starting to celebrate the happy news.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Prince William Says Things Were 'a Bit Anxious' at the Start of Kate's Third Pregnancy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
