{"url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/cardi-b-and-offset-a-hip-hop-love-story-628750/", "text": "One humid afternoon in Atlanta, Cardi B, the new princess of hip-hop, wakes up in an endless white mansion flanked by tall trees. This is her fianc\u00e9\u2019s castle \u2013 he\u2019s Offset from Migos \u2013 and there are enough six-figure cars parked outside to form a small-town parade. By the curved dark-wood door, his friends smoke blunts in tracksuits as bright as British guardsmen\u2019s jackets. Cardi, 25, and Offset, 26, are buying a new home shortly, and building a dream house too. But for now, this is the spot.\n\nWaking up late, Cardi pads around the house barefoot in a yellow cotton dress pulled tight over her swollen, nearly seven-and-a-half-months-pregnant belly. She eats a salad, manages the feat of typing on her phone with three-inch rhinestone-encrusted fake nails, and relaxes into a leather chair. Half zoning out, half watching Avatar, about a different princess and her race to save a far-off moon, she lets out a deep sigh. We are in the late stages of Cardi\u2019s pregnancy and she\u2019s finally wrapped the promotion for her first album, Invasion of Privacy, which topped the charts and set a record for the most first-week streams by a female artist on Apple Music. The exhausting pace of the past months \u2013 spent recording songs, perfecting a raft of lush videos and hiding her belly from the paparazzi \u2013 is receding now. All she needs to do is enjoy the next seven weeks before she becomes a mom.\n\nBut being Cardi, she can\u2019t quite do that. In her songs, she may seem like a 24/7 bad bitch, but today, her face scrubbed clean of makeup and unbrushed, Rapunzel-like blond wig hanging to her waist, she\u2019s a curious combination of raunchy extrovert and angst-plagued introvert. Right now, she\u2019s worrying about the upcoming baby shower for the girl inside her tummy, which she still hasn\u2019t planned. \u201cI\u2019ve got to buy mad flights for my friends from New York,\u201d she says, jiggling her leg, a childhood habit that she indulges in when she\u2019s nervous. \u201cI haven\u2019t even sent the invitations.\u201d Her eyes dart around the room. \u201cI forget everything.\u201d\n\nSee behind the scenes of the Rolling Stone cover shoot with Cardi B and Offset\n\nShe\u2019s saying this to a couple of members of Offset\u2019s extended family who have dropped by for a visit, one of them carrying an infant in tiny white, spotlessly clean sneakers. They listen and nod along, then try to boost her confidence. \u201cYou got it like that, you\u2019re a ballplayer,\u201d one says to her. \u201cBallplayer, my ass!\u201d Cardi replies, shaking her head. She closes her eyes, contemplating her to-do list.\n\nThen they spring open. \u201cI want a lit baby shower,\u201d she declares, waving around a bejeweled finger that catches the light of a grand chandelier hanging behind her while echoing an earlier thought. \u201cMy baby shower\u2019s not starting at no 5:00. My shit is going to start at 9 p.m. because that\u2019s how I celebrate, that\u2019s how Caribbean people celebrate.\u201d She lets out one of her trademark cackles. \u201cI don\u2019t like baby showers that be at 5 p.m. in the backyard, eating, cooking hors d\u2019oeuvres. Nah.\u201d She gets a mischievous look on her face. \u201cShit, I might even drink some red wine. Red wine\u2019s healthy, right?\u201d\n\nOffset\u2019s family was laughing, but this makes them stop. \u201cDon\u2019t let Mama see you drinking that red wine,\u201d says one of them, referring to Offset\u2019s mom. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have a fit.\u201d Cardi laughs, but then appears to think this over. She\u2019s going to be a mother. She has responsibilities to assume.\n\nIn the year or so since she\u2019s become hip-hop\u2019s breakout star, Cardi has come to represent the best of what we value as a country: She\u2019s our irrepressibly cute, sexy, silly, filthy-mouthed Binderella who bootstrapped her way from the streets to celebrity. Once positioning herself as little more than a \u201cregular, degular, shmegular girl from the Bronx,\u201d she\u2019s transformed into a multimedia artist with powerful facets to her personality both on and off the stage. She\u2019s a Caribbean queen purveying the Latin-trap sound (see her Top 10 hit and song-of-the-summer candidate \u201cI Like It\u201d); she\u2019s an ex-stripper with butt injections who\u2019s after your money; she\u2019s a possible former member of the Bloods and such a city girl that she never got a driver\u2019s license and says today that she still carries a knife.\n\nGrowing up with a cab-driving Dominican dad and a strict Trinidadian mom who worked as a cashier, Cardi, born Belcalis Almanzar, rebelled early, fighting with her mom and misbehaving at school. By 19, she was living with a boyfriend who, she says, abused her. Stripping \u201csaved me,\u201d she has said, meaning the money made her independent. She started hosting parties (her job was to \u201cget things turnt up\u201d) and gathered 80,000 followers as a hot girl with a wicked sense of humor on Instagram. She leveraged her role on VH1\u2019s Love & Hip-Hop to launch a rap career, which took off with the release of \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d last June. \u201cI built the fan base,\u201d she declares, whipping a few blond locks over a shoulder. \u201cNo record label, no money, nothing can make you. You make yourself.\u201d\n\nEven with her wild success, guileless personality and castle-dwelling lifestyle, Cardi in conversation still comes across as someone who might pull a knife on you if need be. She expresses genuine indignation toward people who look down on her for her accent and lack of education, and complains about trolls on the Internet: \u201cThese people who want to take food out of my mouth, and my future child\u2019s mouth and my parents\u2019 mouth \u2013 for what?\u201d And when she looks back at her past, it\u2019s not through rose-colored glasses. She resents growing up without money and the limited choices that institutionalized poverty offered her, and uses that energy every day to propel forward her music and her dreams, especially her dreams for her baby.\n\nThe baby \u2013 that\u2019s all anyone is talking about here today. Bounding over with a beaming smile, Offset hands Cardi his phone, where his mom is waiting to talk to her on FaceTime. She wants to discuss whether Cardi should fly with Offset to New York soon, or if flying late in pregnancy is dangerous for the baby, and also, by the way, has she gone shopping for furniture for the new house yet? Cardi listens, nodding her head, polite, but when Offset hangs up the phone, she stares into space.\n\nBorn Kiari Kendrell Cephus, Offset has a rap sheet that includes gun and drug charges and an eight-month stint in jail, and has fathered three children with three different women. But the world knows him from Migos\u2019 platinum albums and the crossover success of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d (which he chalks up to \u201cpeople wanting the real shit!\u201d). Wearing a tight white T-shirt and multiple diamond chains wrapped around his neck, and speaking in a tender tone, he is dapper and handsome, a lady killer to Cardi\u2019s sex bomb. When I ask if he has a jewelry addiction, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t have an addiction, I have a fetish.\u201d\n\nFurniture has been moved out of the first-floor parlor room in this home so he can hang dozens of his outfits, paired with shoes, because he can\u2019t fit all his clothes in an upstairs closet; Cardi rolls her eyes at this and says, \u201cHe\u2019s a boy.\u201d His hands are also cut up from a vicious accident with his green 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat two weeks ago. Six stitches cover the front of a palm. When Cardi first saw him after the accident, covered in blood, she thought he was shot and almost lost her mind.\n\nTheir romance is a hip-hop love story \u2013 a first date at the Super Bowl in 2017 (\u201cThat\u2019s a power move,\u201d Offset told Rolling Stone), followed about eight months later by his marriage proposal, on his knee with an eight-carat engagement ring, onstage during a Philadelphia concert. A couple of months later, there was a slight derailment in the tunnel of love: An iCloud hack allegedly caught Offset in a compromising position with another woman, but he and Cardi made amends, and he inked a new tattoo of Cardi\u2019s name on his neck. (Cardi defended her decision to forgive him, in part, by telling a magazine, \u201cI ain\u2019t no angel.\u201d) In April, Cardi publicly debuted the baby bump on Saturday Night Live in a form-fitting white dress, followed by a video posted online of her jumping around backstage yelling, \u201cI\u2019m finally free!\u201d\n\nAs the lovebirds chat, Cardi absentmindedly caresses Offset\u2019s arm, and later she says, \u201cPeople want to make fun of me, saying I\u2019m the fourth baby mom,\u201d but \u201cI know I\u2019m not having a baby with a shitty-ass man.\u201d Offset explains, \u201cWe really love each other. She\u2019s real. I wanted real. I also wanted successful.\u201d He isn\u2019t threatened by his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s success, as some men might be. \u201cMy mama was the man of my household,\u201d he says, adding, almost as a proclamation, \u201cGuys, fellas! You\u2019ll lose your wife trying to stop them from being the best they can.\u201d These days, Offset is trying to take a page from Cardi and become more open and engaging in public, instead of portraying himself as hard. \u201cThat\u2019s what I need to work on \u2013 my charisma in front of people,\u201d he says solemnly.\n\nMotherhood, the circumscribed world of diapers and bottles and putting up play swings \u2013 Cardi is looking forward to crossing into it. She has a strict mom, Offset has a tough mom, and she grew up with a Caribbean vision of motherhood that involves tending closely to your child and trying to keep them from \u201ceating in the streets.\u201d Of course, she\u2019s nervous, too, about her new responsibilities: \u201cI\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be that kind of mom,\u201d she confesses.\n\nWas the baby planned? Well, no. Late last year, Cardi began to be grossed out by food and not feel quite right. She and Offset had had some sexy pillow talk about making a baby, but she didn\u2019t mean it \u2013 not right now. When a home pregnancy test came back positive, she immediately FaceTimed him. \u201cHe was like, \u2018What? Are you sure?\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And then he just started smiling really hard.\u201d\n\nAt first, she kept the pregnancy quiet, talking with Offset about what to do. \u201cHe said, \u2018What do you mean, what are you going to do? You\u2019re going to keep it.\u2019 \u201d She was consumed with worry. \u201cA lot of successful women have kids, and a lot of successful artists have kids, but not at the peak of their career,\u201d she says. And when she told her close friends and her team, they were apprehensive. \u201cIt was like, \u2018You can\u2019t do this. This might fuck up your career,\u2019 \u201d she declares, resting her hands on her lap.\n\nMaking Invasion of Privacy became a logistical puzzle. Even as Cardi was trying to sync competing demands \u2013 keeping club appearances and concerts she\u2019d already booked, starting work on the album, lining up directors for her videos \u2013 word leaked to Atlantic, her label, that she was pregnant. \u201cThe media didn\u2019t even let me tell people, and I hated that,\u201d she says. \u201cI really wanted to tell them [Atlantic Records] myself, to sit down with them and tell everybody that I am pregnant and I have a plan.\u201d\n\nThe label recommended that Cardi record far from New York, to avoid the distraction of friends and family. At four months pregnant, she says, she entered a studio in L.A. but was too drowsy from pregnancy hormones to concentrate. \u201cWe were making green juice and coffee,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to tell God, \u2018Please don\u2019t make me sleepy.\u2019 \u201d After confessing her pregnancy to her engineer, she asked him and producers to tag along with her, to where she had prebooked appearance dates, to record on the fly. \u201cAll of the creative team kind of followed her around the country, from L.A. to Miami to Atlanta to New York, back to Atlanta,\u201d says Craig Kallman, the CEO of Atlantic Records. Some nights, she\u2019d sleep in the studio; others, she would try to get a good night\u2019s rest to maintain her health for herself and the baby. \u201cI was blown away by her stamina,\u201d Kallman says, plus \u201cher inner strength and her creative instincts.\u201d\n\nOffset consulted with Cardi each step of the way. She has broken up with her manager Klenord \u201cShaft\u201d Raphael, who is suing her and her new team for more than $10 million. She\u2019s not embarrassed about using \u201cco-writers\u201d: Pardison Fontaine, who wrote the main verse of \u201cBe Careful,\u201d is a \u201cdope-ass artist,\u201d she says. Offset helped with Invasion of Privacy, he says, by, among other things, calling Chance the Rapper to collaborate on \u201cBest Life.\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to call and ask, \u2018Can you do this song?\u2019 You don\u2019t think she\u2019s shy, but she don\u2019t like asking for no feature or no song, nothing. But I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\nInvasion of Privacy is the great album that Cardi didn\u2019t really need to make, converting her huge personality into hooks, laugh lines (\u201cOnly thing fake is the boobs!\u201d) and whispers about wanting a man who\u2019ll take care of her heart. It\u2019s the music version of her Instagram \u2013 all killer, no filler. Offset says their artistic instincts are mostly aligned, though he loves Auto-Tune, she hates it. She doesn\u2019t want to pretend, doesn\u2019t want to assume a generic voice. \u201cShe wants you to hear the struggle, so you feel it,\u201d he says.\n\nOffset\u2019s musical ambitions are vast. He\u2019s considering putting out solo tracks this summer, including collaborations with 21 Savage and Metro Boomin. He wants the legacy of artists he idolized growing up: Michael Jackson, Sammy Davis Jr., James Brown and Prince, plus Lil Wayne and Lil Boosie (now Boosie Bad-azz). He was a standout dancer as a kid, putting on Jackson\u2019s dress shirt and socks to entertain his mom, and even performing behind Usher and Whitney Houston in music videos shot in Atlanta. \u201cEverything has to be tight,\u201d says Offset. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a masterpiece like Michael Jackson\u2019s, the same way he treated his music, his dance moves, his stage presence, his outfit, his hair, makeup, whatever it was.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask each of them what they do for fun, they laugh. They aren\u2019t into clubs (\u201cToo much bull,\u201d says Offset), or cooking (amply clear from a kitchen filled with takeout containers) or even binge-watching TV. What music do they listen to? Their own, mostly, both to enjoy it and to meditate on how to make it better. The previous week, Cardi even tweeted that she was amazed that Donald Glover and Childish Gambino look so much alike, not realizing they\u2019re the same person. \u201cWhen you look for him on Apple, his covers are not his face, so how the fuck am I supposed to know him?\u201d she says today of Gambino. \u201cEverybody\u2019s judging me and calling me stupid, and it\u2019s like\u201d \u2013 here comes the heavy Caribbean accent \u2013 \u201c \u2018Fuck ya, leave me alone.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSumming up their lives together, Offset says, \u201cWe work. With a day off, we\u2019ll be in bed all day, just enjoying each other\u2019s company. It ain\u2019t about going to no movie, no dinner, nothing. We can go eat McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s. She might want a chocolate Frosty.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe done so much bizarre shit with each other \u2013 rings and cars and chains. We got that out of the way.\u201d\n\nOffset runs away and Cardi\u2019s back on her phone, handling her business with her talons and jiggling that leg up and down. If Atlanta is her new home, she\u2019ll make it work, though she sometimes feels trapped in the castle, since she doesn\u2019t know how to drive. But \u201cmy boo is very down-South,\u201d and she needs to respect that. Offset doesn\u2019t like the weather or the pace in New York, and wants to build an empire down here, not necessarily a Jay-Z-and-Beyonc\u00e9-style music empire, but one primarily made of straight cash. Cardi says they\u2019ll invest in anything that \u201cmakes our money work,\u201d like apps, Subway franchises or nail salons.\n\nWe talk about the news for a while: She\u2019s disgusted by President Trump and wants her fans to vote in upcoming local elections. \u201cEvery artist has explained how harmful he is,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has made divisions in this country \u2013 he almost made a crazy civil war between the blacks and the whites. He has proven himself to be a madman so many times, and proven himself to be disrespectful to women, and that still hasn\u2019t gotten him impeached.\u201d Then she adds, \u201cClinton got impeached for cheating on his wife, and it\u2019s so clear that this nigga has sex with so many porn stars, and he\u2019s just been shown to be a dickhead, and it\u2019s like, \u2018Nope.'\u201d\n\nThis leads into a conversation about gun laws, which Cardi thinks should be stricter and involve mental evaluations, though she supports the right to bear arms. \u201cGod forbid, the government tries to take us over, and we can\u2019t defend ourselves because we don\u2019t have no weapons.\u201d She adds, \u201cHow do you think American colonizers went to Africa and it was so easy for them to get those people? Because they had guns. No matter what weapon you have, you can\u2019t beat a gun.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cThey have weapons like nuclear bombs that we don\u2019t have. So imagine us not having any weapons at all.\u201d\n\nThis is straying far from baby talk, so we discuss how she\u2019s going to deal with the infant on her upcoming tour (she will be opening for Bruno Mars for seven weeks beginning in September). Cardi is not sure about breast-feeding \u2013 she says her breasts are overly sensitive and she can\u2019t imagine how she would deal with a little baby \u201cmilking\u201d them \u2013 but she wants her kid to be with her constantly. \u201cWhat I envision is my tour bus has my own personal room, and I just want to be with my baby,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly time I don\u2019t have my baby with me is when I\u2019m getting my hair done, makeup done, performing.\u201d She adds, dreamily, \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss one second. I don\u2019t want to miss no smiles, I don\u2019t want to miss no new movement, I don\u2019t want the baby to confuse me and the babysitter.\u201d\n\nCardi wants to be the same woman she is today after giving birth. \u201cJust because I\u2019m a mom, my street credibility\u2019s not gone, my sex appeal\u2019s not gone,\u201d she declares. But how will she open her life up on social media, as she does, with a kid? She\u2019s unsure. \u201cI\u2019m iffy about it,\u201d she says of showing her kid online. \u201cMy feelings get hurt when people online talking about family members. I think I\u2019ll kill somebody if somebody talking about my child like that.\u201d\n\nCardi may not have planned her baby shower, but she has plans about how she\u2019ll treat her child. Her mom was too strict, she thinks, and that\u2019s part of why she rebelled. Cardi and her daughter are going to be best friends. She\u2019s going to teach her English and Spanish, and wants her to start learning French by the time she\u2019s four, and she\u2019ll be a little genius. Maybe she\u2019ll take ballet lessons, though toe shoes can mess up your feet. She\u2019ll definitely put her in kid boxing lessons. \u201cI don\u2019t want my kid to get picked on and she don\u2019t know how to defend herself,\u201d says Cardi. \u201cI have a little brother and I always put in his head, since he was two years old, \u2018Somebody hit you, you kick, you kick, you kick.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd when the baby gets older, Cardi will tell her about her mom\u2019s crazy life. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell her everything. Everything,\u201d she says, beginning a long soliloquy addressing her unborn child. \u201cYou have a choice. I could maintain you. I could spoil you if you go to college. Or if you want to be independent, go ahead. When you a teenager and you 18, 19, you can\u2019t get no job that pays you more than $200 a week.\u201d Her voice starts to rise. \u201cYou want to become a stripper? \u2018Cause I became a stripper \u2019cause I ain\u2019t have no choice. You gonna be getting your ass smacked by niggas that have less money than you, less of an education than you, but they going to feel like they better than you because they feel like you need them. You want to live like that?\u201d She sits back, satisfied by the rant. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m going to talk to my kid.\u201d\n\nSoon she pads across the living room in bare feet, making her way over to a beige chenille couch. Then she lies down on her side and neatly places a lime-green fleece blanket on top of her small shape. \u201cI used to tell myself I would buy a house before I turn 25,\u201d she says, before she dozes off, dreaming a million new dreams.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cardi-B-opener.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.rollingstone.com&path=%2Fmusic%2Fmusic-features%2Fcardi-b-and-offset-a-hip-hop-love-story-628750%2F&ct=article&lob=rollingstone&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=628750", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RS-Get-The-Magazine-Free-Tote.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cardi-B-opener.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vanessa Grigoriadis", "Vanessa Grigoriadis'S Most Recent Stories", "Cardi B", "Offset", "A Hip-Hop Love Story", "Kim Kardashian", "American Woman", "Inside Tinder S Hookup Factory", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/cardi-b-and-offset-a-hip-hop-love-story-628750/", "title": "Cardi B and Offset: A Hip-Hop Love Story", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#df3535", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Rolling Stone", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2018/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cropped-rs-favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "application-name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "Cardi B and Offset of Migos: Inside the lives of two chart-topping pop stars as they prepare their greatest collaboration yet: A baby girl.", "news_keywords": "Cardi B, Hip-Hop, Migos", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Cardi B and Offset: A Hip-Hop Love Story", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/cardi-b-and-offset-a-hip-hop-love-story-628750/", "description": "Inside the lives of two chart-topping pop stars as they prepare their greatest collaboration yet: A baby girl", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cardi-B-opener.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 622}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-20T12:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-02T16:23:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Cardi B and Offset: A Hip-Hop Love Story"}, "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cardi-B-opener.jpg?w=1024", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@RollingStone", "title": "Cardi B and Offset: A Hip-Hop Love Story", "description": "Cardi B and Offset of Migos: Inside the lives of two chart-topping pop stars as they prepare their greatest collaboration yet: A baby girl."}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "author": "Vanessa Grigoriadis", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 628750, "title": "Cardi B and Offset: A Hip-Hop Love Story", "published_at": "2018-06-20 12:00:00", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cardi-B-opener.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Migos", "topics": "Music Features", "body": "One humid afternoon in Atlanta, Cardi B, the new princess of hip-hop, wakes up in an endless white mansion flanked by tall trees. This is her fianc\u00e9's castle \u2013 he's Offset from Migos \u2013 and there are enough six-figure cars parked outside to form a small-town parade. By the curved dark-wood door, his friends smoke blunts in tracksuits as bright as British guardsmen's jackets. Cardi, 25, and Offset, 26, are buying a new home shortly, and building a dream house too. But for now, this is the spot.\r\nWaking up late, Cardi pads around the house barefoot in a yellow cotton dress pulled tight over her swollen, nearly seven-and-a-half-months-pregnant belly. She eats a salad, manages the feat of typing on her phone with three-inch rhinestone-encrusted fake nails, and relaxes into a leather chair. Half zoning out, half watching Avatar, about a different princess and her race to save a far-off moon, she lets out a deep sigh. We are in the late stages of Cardi's pregnancy and she's finally wrapped the promotion for her first album, Invasion of Privacy, which topped the charts and set a record for the most first-week streams by a female artist on Apple Music. The exhausting pace of the past months \u2013 spent recording songs, perfecting a raft of lush videos and hiding her belly from the paparazzi \u2013 is receding now. All she needs to do is enjoy the next seven weeks before she becomes a mom.\r\nBut being Cardi, she can't quite do that. In her songs, she may seem like a 24/7 bad bitch, but today, her face scrubbed clean of makeup and unbrushed, Rapunzel-like blond wig hanging to her waist, she's a curious combination of raunchy extrovert and angst-plagued introvert. Right now, she's worrying about the upcoming baby shower for the girl inside her tummy, which she still hasn't planned. \"I've got to buy mad flights for my friends from New York,\" she says, jiggling her leg, a childhood habit that she indulges in when she's nervous. \"I haven't even sent the invitations.\" Her eyes dart around the room. \"I forget everything.\"\r\nSee behind the scenes of the Rolling Stone cover shoot with Cardi B and Offset\r\n\r\nShe's saying this to a couple of members of Offset's extended family who have dropped by for a visit, one of them carrying an infant in tiny white, spotlessly clean sneakers. They listen and nod along, then try to boost her confidence. \"You got it like that, you're a ballplayer,\" one says to her. \"Ballplayer, my ass!\" Cardi replies, shaking her head. She closes her eyes, contemplating her to-do list.\r\nThen they spring open. \"I want a lit baby shower,\" she declares, waving around a bejeweled finger that catches the light of a grand chandelier hanging behind her while echoing an earlier thought. \"My baby shower's not starting at no 5:00. My shit is going to start at 9 p.m. because that's how I celebrate, that's how Caribbean people celebrate.\" She lets out one of her trademark cackles. \"I don't like baby showers that be at 5 p.m. in the backyard, eating, cooking hors d'oeuvres. Nah.\" She gets a mischievous look on her face. \"Shit, I might even drink some red wine. Red wine's healthy, right?\"\r\nOffset's family was laughing, but this makes them stop. \"Don't let Mama see you drinking that red wine,\" says one of them, referring to Offset's mom. \"She's going to have a fit.\" Cardi laughs, but then appears to think this over. She's going to be a mother. She has responsibilities to assume.\r\nIn the year or so since she's become hip-hop's breakout star, Cardi has come to represent the best of what we value as a country: She's our irrepressibly cute, sexy, silly, filthy-mouthed Binderella who bootstrapped her way from the streets to celebrity. Once positioning herself as little more than a \"regular, degular, shmegular girl from the Bronx,\" she's transformed into a multimedia artist with powerful facets to her personality both on and off the stage. She's a Caribbean queen purveying the Latin-trap sound (see her Top 10 hit and song-of-the-summer candidate \"I Like It\"); she's an ex-stripper with butt injections who's after your money; she's a possible former member of the Bloods and such a city girl that she never got a driver's license and says today that she still carries a knife.\r\nGrowing up with a cab-driving Dominican dad and a strict Trinidadian mom who worked as a cashier, Cardi, born Belcalis Almanzar, rebelled early, fighting with her mom and misbehaving at school. By 19, she was living with a boyfriend who, she says, abused her. Stripping \"saved me,\" she has said, meaning the money made her independent. She started hosting parties (her job was to \"get things turnt up\") and gathered 80,000 followers as a hot girl with a wicked sense of humor on Instagram. She leveraged her role on VH1's Love & Hip-Hop to launch a rap career, which took off with the release of \"Bodak Yellow\" last June. \"I built the fan base,\" she declares, whipping a few blond locks over a shoulder. \"No record label, no money, nothing can make you. You make yourself.\"\r\nEven with her wild success, guileless personality and castle-dwelling lifestyle, Cardi in conversation still comes across as someone who might pull a knife on you if need be. She expresses genuine indignation toward people who look down on her for her accent and lack of education, and complains about trolls on the Internet: \"These people who want to take food out of my mouth, and my future child's mouth and my parents' mouth \u2013 for what?\" And when she looks back at her past, it's not through rose-colored glasses. She resents growing up without money and the limited choices that institutionalized poverty offered her, and uses that energy every day to propel forward her music and her dreams, especially her dreams for her baby.\r\nThe baby \u2013 that's all anyone is talking about here today. Bounding over with a beaming smile, Offset hands Cardi his phone, where his mom is waiting to talk to her on FaceTime. She wants to discuss whether Cardi should fly with Offset to New York soon, or if flying late in pregnancy is dangerous for the baby, and also, by the way, has she gone shopping for furniture for the new house yet? Cardi listens, nodding her head, polite, but when Offset hangs up the phone, she stares into space.\r\n\r\nBorn Kiari Kendrell Cephus, Offset has a rap sheet that includes gun and drug charges and an eight-month stint in jail, and has fathered three children with three different women. But the world knows him from Migos' platinum albums and the crossover success of \"Bad and Boujee\" (which he chalks up to \"people wanting the real shit!\"). Wearing a tight white T-shirt and multiple diamond chains wrapped around his neck, and speaking in a tender tone, he is dapper and handsome, a lady killer to Cardi's sex bomb. When I ask if he has a jewelry addiction, he says, \"I don't have an addiction, I have a fetish.\"\r\nFurniture has been moved out of the first-floor parlor room in this home so he can hang dozens of his outfits, paired with shoes, because he can't fit all his clothes in an upstairs closet; Cardi rolls her eyes at this and says, \"He's a boy.\" His hands are also cut up from a vicious accident with his green 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat two weeks ago. Six stitches cover the front of a palm. When Cardi first saw him after the accident, covered in blood, she thought he was shot and almost lost her mind.\r\nTheir romance is a hip-hop love story \u2013 a first date at the Super Bowl in 2017 (\"That's a power move,\" Offset told Rolling Stone), followed about eight months later by his marriage proposal, on his knee with an eight-carat engagement ring, onstage during a Philadelphia concert. A couple of months later, there was a slight derailment in the tunnel of love: An iCloud hack allegedly caught Offset in a compromising position with another woman, but he and Cardi made amends, and he inked a new tattoo of Cardi's name on his neck. (Cardi defended her decision to forgive him, in part, by telling a magazine, \"I ain't no angel.\") In April, Cardi publicly debuted the baby bump on Saturday Night Live in a form-fitting white dress, followed by a video posted online of her jumping around backstage yelling, \"I'm finally free!\"\r\nAs the lovebirds chat, Cardi absentmindedly caresses Offset's arm, and later she says, \"People want to make fun of me, saying I'm the fourth baby mom,\" but \"I know I'm not having a baby with a shitty-ass man.\" Offset explains, \"We really love each other. She's real. I wanted real. I also wanted successful.\" He isn't threatened by his fianc\u00e9e's success, as some men might be. \"My mama was the man of my household,\" he says, adding, almost as a proclamation, \"Guys, fellas! You'll lose your wife trying to stop them from being the best they can.\" These days, Offset is trying to take a page from Cardi and become more open and engaging in public, instead of portraying himself as hard. \"That's what I need to work on \u2013 my charisma in front of people,\" he says solemnly.\r\n\r\nMotherhood, the circumscribed world of diapers and bottles and putting up play swings \u2013 Cardi is looking forward to crossing into it. She has a strict mom, Offset has a tough mom, and she grew up with a Caribbean vision of motherhood that involves tending closely to your child and trying to keep them from \"eating in the streets.\" Of course, she's nervous, too, about her new responsibilities: \"I'm scared I won't be that kind of mom,\" she confesses.\r\nWas the baby planned? Well, no. Late last year, Cardi began to be grossed out by food and not feel quite right. She and Offset had had some sexy pillow talk about making a baby, but she didn't mean it \u2013 not right now. When a home pregnancy test came back positive, she immediately FaceTimed him. \"He was like, \u2018What? Are you sure?'\u2009\" she says. \"I said, \u2018Yeah.' And then he just started smiling really hard.\"\r\nAt first, she kept the pregnancy quiet, talking with Offset about what to do. \"He said, \u2018What do you mean, what are you going to do? You're going to keep it.'\u2009\" She was consumed with worry. \"A lot of successful women have kids, and a lot of successful artists have kids, but not at the peak of their career,\" she says. And when she told her close friends and her team, they were apprehensive. \"It was like, \u2018You can't do this. This might fuck up your career,'\u2009\" she declares, resting her hands on her lap.\r\nMaking Invasion of Privacy became a logistical puzzle. Even as Cardi was trying to sync competing demands \u2013 keeping club appearances and concerts she'd already booked, starting work on the album, lining up directors for her videos \u2013 word leaked to Atlantic, her label, that she was pregnant. \"The media didn't even let me tell people, and I hated that,\" she says. \"I really wanted to tell them [Atlantic Records] myself, to sit down with them and tell everybody that I am pregnant and I have a plan.\"\r\nThe label recommended that Cardi record far from New York, to avoid the distraction of friends and family. At four months pregnant, she says, she entered a studio in L.A. but was too drowsy from pregnancy hormones to concentrate. \"We were making green juice and coffee,\" she says. \"I used to tell God, \u2018Please don't make me sleepy.'\u2009\" After confessing her pregnancy to her engineer, she asked him and producers to tag along with her, to where she had prebooked appearance dates, to record on the fly. \"All of the creative team kind of followed her around the country, from L.A. to Miami to Atlanta to New York, back to Atlanta,\" says Craig Kallman, the CEO of Atlantic Records. Some nights, she'd sleep in the studio; others, she would try to get a good night's rest to maintain her health for herself and the baby. \"I was blown away by her stamina,\" Kallman says, plus \"her inner strength and her creative instincts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffset consulted with Cardi each step of the way. She has broken up with her manager Klenord \"Shaft\" Raphael, who is suing her and her new team for more than $10 million. She's not embarrassed about using \"co-writers\": Pardison Fontaine, who wrote the main verse of \"Be Careful,\" is a \"dope-ass artist,\" she says. Offset helped with Invasion of Privacy, he says, by, among other things, calling Chance the Rapper to collaborate on \"Best Life.\" \"She doesn't want to call and ask, \u2018Can you do this song?' You don't think she's shy, but she don't like asking for no feature or no song, nothing. But I don't give a damn.\"\r\n\r\nInvasion of Privacy is the great album that Cardi didn't really need to make, converting her huge personality into hooks, laugh lines (\"Only thing fake is the boobs!\") and whispers about wanting a man who'll take care of her heart. It's the music version of her Instagram \u2013 all killer, no filler. Offset says their artistic instincts are mostly aligned, though he loves Auto-Tune, she hates it. She doesn't want to pretend, doesn't want to assume a generic voice. \"She wants you to hear the struggle, so you feel it,\" he says.\r\n\r\nOffset's musical ambitions are vast. He's considering putting out solo tracks this summer, including collaborations with 21 Savage and Metro Boomin. He wants the legacy of artists he idolized growing up: Michael Jackson, Sammy Davis Jr., James Brown and Prince, plus Lil Wayne and Lil Boosie (now Boosie Bad-azz). He was a standout dancer as a kid, putting on Jackson's dress shirt and socks to entertain his mom, and even performing behind Usher and Whitney Houston in music videos shot in Atlanta. \"Everything has to be tight,\" says Offset. \"It's got to be a masterpiece like Michael Jackson's, the same way he treated his music, his dance moves, his stage presence, his outfit, his hair, makeup, whatever it was.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I ask each of them what they do for fun, they laugh. They aren't into clubs (\"Too much bull,\" says Offset), or cooking (amply clear from a kitchen filled with takeout containers) or even binge-watching TV. What music do they listen to? Their own, mostly, both to enjoy it and to meditate on how to make it better. The previous week, Cardi even tweeted that she was amazed that Donald Glover and Childish Gambino look so much alike, not realizing they're the same person. \"When you look for him on Apple, his covers are not his face, so how the fuck am I supposed to know him?\" she says today of Gambino. \"Everybody's judging me and calling me stupid, and it's like\" \u2013 here comes the heavy Caribbean accent \u2013 \"\u2009\u2018Fuck ya, leave me alone.'\u2009\"\r\n\r\nSumming up their lives together, Offset says, \"We work. With a day off, we'll be in bed all day, just enjoying each other's company. It ain't about going to no movie, no dinner, nothing. We can go eat McDonald's or Wendy's. She might want a chocolate Frosty.\" He adds, \"We done so much bizarre shit with each other \u2013 rings and cars and chains. We got that out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffset runs away and Cardi's back on her phone, handling her business with her talons and jiggling that leg up and down. If Atlanta is her new home, she'll make it work, though she sometimes feels trapped in the castle, since she doesn't know how to drive. But \"my boo is very down-South,\" and she needs to respect that. Offset doesn't like the weather or the pace in New York, and wants to build an empire down here, not necessarily a Jay-Z-and-Beyonc\u00e9-style music empire, but one primarily made of straight cash. Cardi says they'll invest in anything that \"makes our money work,\" like apps, Subway franchises or nail salons.\r\n\r\nWe talk about the news for a while: She's disgusted by President Trump and wants her fans to vote in upcoming local elections. \"Every artist has explained how harmful he is,\" she says. \"He has made divisions in this country \u2013 he almost made a crazy civil war between the blacks and the whites. He has proven himself to be a madman so many times, and proven himself to be disrespectful to women, and that still hasn't gotten him impeached.\" Then she adds, \"Clinton got impeached for cheating on his wife, and it's so clear that this nigga has sex with so many porn stars, and he's just been shown to be a dickhead, and it's like, \u2018Nope.'\"\r\n\r\nThis leads into a conversation about gun laws, which Cardi thinks should be stricter and involve mental evaluations, though she supports the right to bear arms. \"God forbid, the government tries to take us over, and we can't defend ourselves because we don't have no weapons.\" She adds, \"How do you think American colonizers went to Africa and it was so easy for them to get those people? Because they had guns. No matter what weapon you have, you can't beat a gun.\" She shrugs. \"They have weapons like nuclear bombs that we don't have. So imagine us not having any weapons at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis is straying far from baby talk, so we discuss how she's going to deal with the infant on her upcoming tour (she will be opening for Bruno Mars for seven weeks beginning in September). Cardi is not sure about breast-feeding \u2013 she says her breasts are overly sensitive and she can't imagine how she would deal with a little baby \"milking\" them \u2013 but she wants her kid to be with her constantly. \"What I envision is my tour bus has my own personal room, and I just want to be with my baby,\" she says. \"Only time I don't have my baby with me is when I'm getting my hair done, makeup done, performing.\" She adds, dreamily, \"I don't want to miss one second. I don't want to miss no smiles, I don't want to miss no new movement, I don't want the baby to confuse me and the babysitter.\"\r\n\r\nCardi wants to be the same woman she is today after giving birth. \"Just because I'm a mom, my street credibility's not gone, my sex appeal's not gone,\" she declares. But how will she open her life up on social media, as she does, with a kid? She's unsure. \"I'm iffy about it,\" she says of showing her kid online. \"My feelings get hurt when people online talking about family members. I think I'll kill somebody if somebody talking about my child like that.\"\r\n\r\nCardi may not have planned her baby shower, but she has plans about how she'll treat her child. Her mom was too strict, she thinks, and that's part of why she rebelled. Cardi and her daughter are going to be best friends. She's going to teach her English and Spanish, and wants her to start learning French by the time she's four, and she'll be a little genius. Maybe she'll take ballet lessons, though toe shoes can mess up your feet. She'll definitely put her in kid boxing lessons. \"I don't want my kid to get picked on and she don't know how to defend herself,\" says Cardi. \"I have a little brother and I always put in his head, since he was two years old, \u2018Somebody hit you, you kick, you kick, you kick.'\u2009\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the baby gets older, Cardi will tell her about her mom's crazy life. \"I'm going to tell her everything. Everything,\" she says, beginning a long soliloquy addressing her unborn child. \"You have a choice. I could maintain you. I could spoil you if you go to college. Or if you want to be independent, go ahead. When you a teenager and you 18, 19, you can't get no job that pays you more than $200 a week.\" Her voice starts to rise. \"You want to become a stripper? 'Cause I became a stripper 'cause I ain't have no choice. You gonna be getting your ass smacked by niggas that have less money than you, less of an education than you, but they going to feel like they better than you because they feel like you need them. You want to live like that?\" She sits back, satisfied by the rant. \"That's how I'm going to talk to my kid.\"\r\n\r\nSoon she pads across the living room in bare feet, making her way over to a beige chenille couch. Then she lies down on her side and neatly places a lime-green fleece blanket on top of her small shape. \"I used to tell myself I would buy a house before I turn 25,\" she says, before she dozes off, dreaming a million new dreams.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529496000.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
