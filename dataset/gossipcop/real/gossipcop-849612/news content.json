Even though it might seem overwhelming, there's no need to spend a lot of money on makeup when there are tons of beauty products for beginners at drugstores. And there's also no need to be a makeup artist to shop at drugstores, so it's a lot less intimidating to pick out what you want. You can take as much time as you would like selecting products, and don't need to feel the pressure of buying anything. It's a win/win scenario for anyone, really, but especially those who are new to makeup and intimidated by some of the shopping process.\n\nWhen it comes to being a makeup newbie, it's all about selecting the right essentials.
