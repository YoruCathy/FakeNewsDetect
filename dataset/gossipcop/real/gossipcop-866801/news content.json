The occasion was the London red carpet premiere of Christopher Nolan\u2019s World War II Dunkirk, marking the first time the public would be privy to Styles\u2019s much-anticipated acting chops. Which is exciting! More exciting perhaps is this video footage of the interaction between the Harrys, tweeted from a One Direction fan account that trains its eagle eyes on Styles as he rises aloft to other ventures, other industries:\n\nThere you see Styles impishly awaiting his turn, trying to keep a straight face. The greeting looks all very civil, like they\u2019d practiced it, all nods and pleasantries. At one point, Prince Harry gestures to the right. \u201cOver there is the door,\u201d we assume he said. \u201cLet me know when you want to leave all this behind and go grab a pint.\u201d\n\nIt was a reunion of sorts. They first met at the perfectly named Royal Variety Performance in London in 2015, when Harry Styles was still (hold back those tears) performing with One Direction, and Prince Harry had not even yet met Meghan Markle (imagine!). Back then, they talked about Harry Styles\u2019s hair: the royal, perhaps with just a smidgen of jealousy given the clean-cut look he has to sport, asked if he was ever going to cut it.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/595e5ca74f8f14297f80ccd1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Prince-Harry-Leeds.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f8d585d30c374e9109f68c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/william-harry-star-wars-cameos.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55cced3b8fbf768838dcb5f2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-style-formal-casual-ibdl-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55cced40169027501c6f5c0f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-style-formal-casual-ibdl-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f4c3d10ba2cf01fc200a7d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Prince-Harry-mental-health.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55cced3b8fbf768838dcb5f4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-style-formal-casual-ibdl-ss02.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kenzie Bryant", "Kenzie Bryan", "Josh Dubof", "Joanna Robinso", "Julie Mille"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/prince-harry-harry-styles-reunion", "title": "Prince Harry and Harry Styles Reunite", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kenzie Bryant", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Two friends\u2014or, at least, famous Brits who have met before\u2014saw each other on the red carpet in London.", "id": "5967c73c3a5a726a87a630a4", "keywords": "celebrity,harry styles,prince harry,dunkirk", "news_keywords": "celebrity,harry styles,prince harry,dunkirk", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5967c73c3a5a726a87a630a4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Two friends\u2014or, at least, famous Brits who have met before\u2014saw each other on the red carpet in London.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Two friends\u2014or, at least, famous Brits who have met before\u2014saw each other on the red carpet in London.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Prince Harry and Harry Styles Reunite", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/prince-harry-harry-styles-reunion"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Two friends\u2014or, at least, famous Brits who have met before\u2014saw each other on the red carpet in London.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5967c7994f8f14297f80ce28/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/harry-meets-harry.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Prince Harry and Harry Styles Reunite"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
