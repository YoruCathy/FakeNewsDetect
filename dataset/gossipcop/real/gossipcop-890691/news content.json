In this weekly series, we put a mix of popular and under-the-radar tutorials to the test and show you what's best.\n\nA crown braid is the type of hairstyle that seems super complicated, no matter how many times pro stylists swear you can totally do it yourself. But with this video tutorial from beauty YouTuber Sazan Hendrix, you may finally believe it's a look that's actually DIY-able. She breaks it down into super-simple steps that don't require crazy-intricate techniques; you just need to know how to do a plain old three-strand braid.\n\n\"It's summer, which means... hairstyles gotta be on fleek!\" Sazan starts. (I can forgive her for saying this, if only because the tutorial that follows is so fast and easy to follow, I can't help but love her for it. Also, she has excellent eyebrows, so I know I can trust her.) Then she separates her hair into two sections, weaves a long braid on either side and pins them up. It's pretty much that simple. Watch the full video to see more of her little tweaks and tips throughout the process that make the style look more finished, but it doesn't get much more complicated than that.
