Raised in SoHo and on the Lower East Side by a father descended from Spanish nobility and a mother who is a policy analyst on women\u2019s issues in Third World countries, de la Huerta had been acting and modeling since her teens, and now seemed to be breaking through. The year before she had co-starred in Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s Enter the Void, which had recently opened in the U.S. And her recurring role on HBO\u2019s just-premiered Prohibition-period gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire, as mistress to Steve Buscemi\u2019s Enoch \u201cNucky\u201d Thompson, had earned her critical praise.\n\nOne night that November, de la Huerta ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Top of the Standard bar at the Standard, High Line hotel in Manhattan. She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects. When they met at the hotel in 2010 de la Huerta was 26 and Weinstein was at the height of his powers as an Oscar-winning producer. The Weinstein Company was about to enter a streak that would see it win best picture at the Academy Awards two years in a row, first for The King\u2019s Speech in 2011 and then The Artist in 2012. Weinstein offered de la Huerta a ride home to Tribeca. In de la Huerta\u2019s account of the night, Weinstein arrived at her apartment demanding to come inside and have a drink. \u201cThings got very uncomfortable very fast,\u201d the actress, now 33, told Vanity Fair in a phone interview on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cImmediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,\u201d de la Huerta said. \u201cThen he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid. . . . It wasn\u2019t consensual . . . It happened very quickly. . . . He stuck himself inside me. . . . When he was done he said he\u2019d be calling me. I kind of just laid on the bed in shock.\u201d\n\nDe la Huerta described a second assault that allegedly happened in late December 2010, when Weinstein showed up in her building lobby after she came home from a photo shoot. The actress said she had been drinking, and was frightened by Weinstein, who had been repeatedly calling her, despite her asking him to leave her alone. \u201cHe hushed me and said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about this in your apartment,\u2019\u201d de la Huerta said. \u201cI was in no state. I was so terrified of him. . . . I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019 He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He\u2019s like a pig. . . . He raped me.\u201d\n\nAfterward, de la Huerta said, \u201cI laid there feeling sick. He looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019ll put you in a play.\u2019 He left and I never heard from him again. He knew he had done a bad thing.\u201d\n\nIn many respects, de la Huerta\u2019s story mirrors the more than 60 other women who have opened up about the producer since allegations of his sexual misconduct first appeared in The New York Times and The New Yorker last month. But her case is unusual in one key respect\u2014it may see charges brought against Weinstein. De la Huerta has been interviewed by New York Police Department detective Nicholas DiGaudio, who is leading the Weinstein investigation, and her attorney has provided material to New York District Attorney Maxine B. Rosenthal, who is considering bringing charges in the case.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dcf2d26e4f1e2f8f9b1423/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Harvey-Weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations%2525202.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fb986ca134f64a023a3eda/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-paz-de-la-huerta-01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fb986f9265703fc0fe52e9/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/paz-de-la-huerta-01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e0e31f6f1d607cf8711a13/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/harvey-weinstein-scandal-hollwood.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fb986ca134f64a023a3eda/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-paz-de-la-huerta-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Keegan", "Rebecca Keega", "Yohana Dest", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/paz-de-la-huerta-harvey-weinstein-allegations", "title": "Paz de la Huerta Says Harvey Weinstein Raped Her Twice.
