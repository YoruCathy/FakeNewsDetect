In a statement to ET, the pair said that they decided to go their separate ways at the end of last year. \"We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship,\" the statement added.\n\nAfter several high-profile relationships, Aniston knows what works and what doesn't in a relationship. In 2009, before meeting Theroux, she told ET about the signs she looks for when deciding whether it's time to cut the cord.\n\nSee photos of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux together:\n\n\n\n27 PHOTOS Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston together See Gallery Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston together HOLLYWOOD, CA - JULY 26: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux attend the ceremony honoring Jason Bateman with Star On The Hollywood Walk Of Fame on July 25, 2017 in Hollywood, California.

According to ET's source, her breakup with Theroux couldn't be more different from the infamously \"messy\" separation.\n\n\"This was not like [her divorce from] Brad [Pitt], where it was heartwrenching and messy,\" the source shares. \"This was a clean split between two people who realized marriage wasn't for them, but can still be in each other's lives, to some extent.\"\n\n\"You won't see Jen and Justin avoiding each other at events like she and Brad did,\" the source adds.\n\nSee photos of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston together:\n\n\n\n24 PHOTOS Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt together See Gallery Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt together Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston during The 56th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards - Red Carpet at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, United States.
