The 38-year-old actress, who gave birth to her second bundle of joy in June with husband Scott Campbell, revealed that the couple welcomed a baby boy named Ozzy (short for Osgood) during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Wednesday, August 16.\n\nBell, who showed off her post-baby body in a green, formfitting dress, revealed that the couple didn\u2019t plan their second pregnancy. (They are already parents of Daughter Nova, 2.)\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things where my husband and I were so excited to have just one kid,\u201d the New York City native said. \u201cWe have a beautiful daughter, Nova. She\u2019s awesome \u2014 named after the Chevy, obviously. It\u2019s also celestial, but you know what I mean \u2014 more so the Chevy. We were so excited to travel the world. We were like, \u2018We\u2019re going to be modern. We don\u2019t have to have two kids.'\u201d\n\nWhen the late-night host, 49, asked why the couple\u2019s plans had changed, the actress quipped, \u201cWe had sexual intercourse.\u201d\n\nAnd while the proud parents are elated over their new addition, the What Happens In Vegas actress said their daughter is having a difficult time welcoming her baby brother.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s having some trouble,\u201d Bell said of Nova. \u201cShe plays with the baby dolls and stuff, so I thought it was going to be a shoo-in \u2014 like a real, live baby doll. She\u2019s having trouble with it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Bell says Ozzy has changed her life \u201cso vastly\u201d since his arrival. \u201cThere\u2019s so much wrangling and so many logistics. Your marriage turns into just a logistics conversation. The other day \u2014 and I promise this is without hyperbole; this really happened\u2014we were going through our schedules,\u201d she told Kimmel. \u201cSo, we really made a moment in our schedule to plan our schedule.\u201d\n\nThe No Strings Attached star and Campbell got engaged in March 2012 and tied the knot in June 2013.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/468866448_lake-bell-scott-campbell-zoom-0df21ff9-83fb-4db9-a2af-b22af7fe84d8.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-bell-zoom-36755c81-72ae-4c51-a586-78393544d6bf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-bell-zoom-5a143e6c-d428-4881-928a-8f2c372b0889.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-bell-zoom-36755c81-72ae-4c51-a586-78393544d6bf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/lake-bell-reveals-her-second-child-is-a-boy-named-him-ozzy-w498348/", "title": "Lake Bell Reveals Her Second Child Is a Boy: Find Out His Name!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Lake Bell revealed the name of her second child during an appearance on \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019 on Wednesday, August 16 \u2014 watch!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lake Bell Reveals Her Second Child Is a Boy: Find Out His Name!", "description": "Lake Bell revealed the name of her second child during an appearance on \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019 on Wednesday, August 16 \u2014 watch!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/lake-bell-reveals-her-second-child-is-a-boy-named-him-ozzy-w498348/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:40:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-bell-zoom-36755c81-72ae-4c51-a586-78393544d6bf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-bell-zoom-36755c81-72ae-4c51-a586-78393544d6bf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-08-17T19:35:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:40:50+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lake Bell revealed the name of her second child during an appearance on \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019 on Wednesday, August 16 \u2014 watch!", "title": "Lake Bell Reveals Her Second Child Is a Boy: Find Out His Name!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lake-bell-zoom-36755c81-72ae-4c51-a586-78393544d6bf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502998509.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
