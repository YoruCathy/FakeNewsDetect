He's on a worldwide press tour promoting his first major studio blockbuster Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, he wrote a song for the soundtrack of Ferdinand, and this week, it was revealed that he has been nominated for his first-ever Golden Globe, for Best Original Song.\n\nUnfortunately for him, though, learning about his nomination wasn't a particularly pleasant experience. E! News reports that Jonas found out about the honor in a frightening manner.\n\nImage zoom Christopher Polk/Getty\n\n\"My wake up call this morning was one of my friends banging on my door because I wasn't answering my phone,\" he said. \"He handed me his phone and at first I feared that something was wrong, but then it was my manager telling me the news and I freaked out. I was like a ten-year-old child who just got a new Gameboy.\"\n\nThankfully, despite the initial fear, it sounds like Jonas had a pleasant reaction to the happy news. The song he's nominated for\u2014\"Home,\" on the Ferdinand soundtrack\u2014appropriately hits home for Jonas as well.\n\nRELATED: Nick Jonas Says That His Mom Still Does His Laundry\n\n\"The theme for the song was the idea of home being the place we feel most accepted and loved,\" he said. \"Home being your family, your friends, your loved ones. When I started thinking about that it was sort of like an outpouring. I don't know that I have actually ever written a song about my family before, and so for the first one to be recognized in this way is great.\"\n\nWe wish Nick the best of luck with his first nomination. Tune into the Golden Globes on NBC on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018 at 8 p.m. ET to see if he won.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121217-nick-jonas.jpg%3Fitok%3DM5EshQbn", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121217-nick-jonas.jpg%3Fitok%3D90TddOWe"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121217-nick-jonas.jpg%3Fitok%3D90TddOWe", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Whittaker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/nick-jonas-golden-globe-nomination", "title": "The Terrifying Way Nick Jonas Found Out About His First Golden Globe Nomination", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,Celebrity,Awards & Events,Golden Globes,Nick Jonas", "news_keywords": "nick jonas, golden globe nominations, nick jonas golden globes, nick jonas awards, nick jonas 2017, golden globe nominees, golden globes", "description": "Nick Jonas has been nominated for his first-ever Golden Globe, but finding that out was a terrifying experience for him.", "og": {"title": "The Terrifying\u00a0Way Nick Jonas Found Out About His First-Ever Golden Globes Nomination", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/nick-jonas-golden-globe-nomination", "description": "To say the news came as a surprise is a major understatement.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121217-nick-jonas.jpg%3Fitok%3D90TddOWe"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/nick-jonas-golden-globe-nomination", "description": "Nick Jonas has been nominated for his first-ever Golden Globe, but finding that out was a terrifying experience for him.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121217-nick-jonas.jpg%3Fitok%3D90TddOWe"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/nick-jonas-golden-globe-nomination", "title": "The Terrifying\u00a0Way Nick Jonas Found Out About His First-Ever Golden Globes Nomination", "description": "To say the news came as a surprise is a major understatement.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121217-nick-jonas.jpg%3Fitok%3D90TddOWe"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
