The dog, who was named Tilly before Efron adopted her, was about to be euthanized before the shelter took her in.\n\nW Blanco/Backgrid\n\n\"Maca was being led to the kill room when we stepped in and said we would take her. She was turned around and brought to us!,\" Bark n' Bitches wrote on Instagram in April. \"This guy named Zac Efron came in (we hear he is an actor, but we think he actually waits tables) came in and fell in love.\"\n\nDaddario has her own rescue pup: a sweet terrier mix named Levon.\n\n\"I have an adopted dog and he's my best friend. I found out what rescue shelter he was at, and it was love at first sight,\u201d says Daddario, who first spotted Levon on Adopt-a-Pet.com. Now, the actress is partnering with Dogtrader.com\u2014Autotrader\u2019s new dog adoption website created with Adopt-a-Pet.com\u2014to encourage more people to adopt rescues. \u201cHe had been neglected and it was such a great feeling to bring him into my home, and to see him get happier and happier, and to feel safer and safer, and see his personality come out more.\u201d\n\nIt was Efron\u2019s offer for a doggie date with Levon (and Daddario) that sparked romance rumors from fans. When Efron adopted MACA, he introduced her to the world with a sweet Instagram photo \u2014 and in the comments he tagged Daddario and said \u201cdoggie date?\u201d\n\nBut the actress says she hasn\u2019t taken him up on the offer.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been working a lot, so not recently,\" says Daddario, who starred in When We First Met earlier this year. \"Our lives get so crazy, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to keep in touch with people. But you have to take the dog out on a hike every now and then, so sometimes with friends we\u2019ll meet up.\"\n\n\"When your friends\u2019 dogs start to get to know each other and they either like each other or they don't, it\u2019s really cute to see,\" she adds. \"It\u2019s like the precursor of children.\"\n\nIf Efron wants to take things out of the friendzone, we hope for his sake that Levon likes him.\n\n\"I have this long-running joke that my dog has to like the guy I\u2019m dating or else I can\u2019t date him,\" Daddario says with a laugh. \"It\u2019s only happened once that my dog really hated the guy I brought home. It was someone I dated for a while, and he just didn\u2019t like him.\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bgus-1188656-001-1-1535122487.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.115xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bgus-1188656-001-1-1535122487.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.115xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eileen Reslen", "I M Eileen", "The Digital News Reporter At Hearst Digital Media."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22822385/alexandra-daddario-zac-efron-dog-maca-adoption/", "title": "Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron's Dogs Might be Dating But They Are Not", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron's Dogs Might be Dating But They Are Not", "description": "Everyone thinks their flirty Instas about their dogs means they\u2019re dating.
