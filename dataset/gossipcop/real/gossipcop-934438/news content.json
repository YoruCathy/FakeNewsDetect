(It\u2019s cool, but it\u2019s certainly no \u201cDirrty\u201d or \u201cYour Body.\u201d)\n\n\u201cTwice,\u201d however, is what I\u2019m talking about: The \u201cTelepathy\u201d chanteuse is going Back To Basics on the emotional ballad. Yupp, \u201cTwice\u201d is another (refreshingly) restrained moment for Christina, allowing her emotionally charged powerhouse pipes to take the full spotlight on the track without drowning out the beautiful melodies with her exaggerated vocal runs. She\u2019s always truly shined in ballad form, and \u201cTwice\u201d is no exception \u2014 the Stripped-back intro and outro, especially are chill-inducing moments.\n\nHow does it factor within the grand scheme of all Xtina ballads? It\u2019s not as immediately memorable as \u201cHurt,\u201d \u201cYou Lost Me\u201d or \u201cBeautiful,\u201d but it\u2019s an undeniably gorgeous listen for true lovers of balladry \u2013 and it only gets better with each replay. Christina\u2018s still one of the best vocalists in the game, and this track is further proof of her true talent.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that we should expect the unexpected this time around, ya dig?\n\nChristina Aguilera\u2019s latest \u201cTwice\u201d is also available on Apple Music and Spotify!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/logo-jonali.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i2.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fionath.png?resize=300%2C300", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Small_JA-Logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may3.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may5.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a5e244435b8c0e5fb59b1da39ec554a9?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i0.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/minajthujmb.png?resize=300%2C300", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i2.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/christina-aguilera-liberation-twice.png?resize=868%2C680", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may4.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/http://jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i1.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/jtthumb.png?resize=305%2C305", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i2.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/christina-aguilera-liberation-twice.png?fit=868%2C680"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i2.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/christina-aguilera-liberation-twice.png?fit=868%2C680", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150/http://jonalisblog.com/2018/05/11/christina-aguilera-goes-back-to-basics-on-soul-baring-liberation-ballad-twice/", "title": "Christina Aguilera Goes Back To Basics On Soul-Baring \u2018Liberation\u2019 Ballad, \u2018Twice\u2019!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.6.12", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Christina Aguilera Goes Back To Basics On Soul-Baring \u2018Liberation\u2019 Ballad, \u2018Twice\u2019!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150/http://jonalisblog.com/2018/05/11/christina-aguilera-goes-back-to-basics-on-soul-baring-liberation-ballad-twice/", "description": "Fresh off announcing her upcoming The Liberation Tour and duet performance for \u201cFall In Line\u201d with Demi Lovato at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards later this month, Christina Aguilera ha\u2026", "site_name": "Jon ALi's Blog", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i2.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/christina-aguilera-liberation-twice.png?fit=868%2C680", "width": 868, "height": 680}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-11T04:43:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-11T07:42:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150im_/https://i2.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/christina-aguilera-liberation-twice.png?fit=868%2C680&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/jonalisblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180514041150if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1jzwV_s8_Y"], "publish_date": 1525968000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
