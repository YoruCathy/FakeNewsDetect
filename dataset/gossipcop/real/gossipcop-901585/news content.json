I\u2019m emotional. My dog is emotional. But whatever we\u2019re feeling is probably dwarfed by the feelings of the people who have labored to create this show for the past eight years (or longer, for select members of the production). Speaking to Deadline, Kit Harington (Jon Snow) seems pretty broken up about it\u2026so far as a Englishman can be, anyway. \u201cI\u2019m understandably more affected by it than I thought I would be,\u201d he said.\n\nYou know I wasn\u2019t quite cynical about things, I\u2019m quite straightforward and English. But, really, eight years of your life is a long time to connect with anything. I didn\u2019t know at the beginning if this would be a show that no one would watch or if it would be a show that a lot of people would watch. And I\u2019ve never been in a situation, a show, that\u2019s lasted this long. In my life it\u2019s pretty significant thing that\u2019s happened to me, and coming to the end of it is understandably quite emotional.\n\nStop it, Kit, you\u2019re embarrassing yourself.\n\nJust kidding. Anyway, with the show wrapping up in 2019, expectations are high. No one wants the show to trip as it approaches the finish line. Per Harington, that\u2019s resulted in a new kind of pressure on set \u201cI\u2019ve not felt before.\u201d\n\nWhereas before, every year there\u2019s always been a bit of pressure, this season is one where we could easily let people down. Obviously, we don\u2019t want to do that so we\u2019re very much stepping up everyone\u2019s game which is very apparent, at least to me.\n\nHarington avoided giving specifics on how the story will or won\u2019t live up to fans\u2019 expectations, but did say that filming is \u201cgoing really well\u2026These days are long and a grind but we\u2019ve got the first section out of the way, and all is well. All is good.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all we\u2019re likely to get out of him \u2014 Harington\u2019s an old pro at not giving things away by this point.\n\nLast night I bumped into Kit Harrington, Ray Donovans wife and Belfast legend @StephenNolan pic.twitter.com/a0SzHdKkXI \u2014 Mick Finnegan (@Mick_Finnegan) December 21, 2017\n\nHarington also discussed Gunpowder, a three-part historical drama he appeared in for the BBC \u2014 HBO picked it up to distribute stateside. Harington also produced the show, which was a change for him and could herald big things ahead.\n\nI definitely want to produce again, but I also recently thought of the idea of directing. I think there\u2019s something in that that Game of Thrones has given me, which may be nothing else but great years with so many different directors, and doing such intensive amounts of work with different directors. But I feel like I\u2019ve gotten an understanding of directing and producing from working on Thrones and working on various other projects that makes it appealing to me.\n\nBut that\u2019s in the future. After Thrones is over, Harington figures he\u2019ll spend time with fianc\u00e9 Rose Leslie (Ygritte) and carefully choose his next project. That said, he will appear in How to Train Your Dragon 3 in 2019. He hasn\u2019t escaped the world of dragons and fantasy just yet.\n\nElsewhere in the Thrones-verse, star Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm) teased Digital Spy about whether he was even going to appear in season 8, despite the fact that he was spotted at the full cast read-through back in October. \u201cMaybe I was just at the read-through for fun,\u201d he said, stirring the pot like a mischievous witch.\n\nLiterally everybody is banished from saying a single thing. We don\u2019t even know if Grey Worm is going to be in it, but I can probably confirm to you that Grey Worm will be in one second of Game of Thrones season eight. I can guarantee that.\n\nWe\u2019ll take what we can get, I guess.\n\nTo stay up to date on everything Game of Thrones, follow our all-encompassing Facebook page and sign up for our exclusive newsletter.\n\nWatch Game of Thrones for FREE with a no-risk, 7-day free trial of Amazon Channel", "images": ["https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/winteriscoming/logo_winteriscoming-net__150x150.png", "https://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/android-app.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1578981752316085&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_2994,w_4500/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FGrey-Worm-Casterly-Rock-Official.jpg", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,f_auto,w_150,h_150/https://fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/winteriscoming/logo_winteriscoming-net__150x150.png", "https://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/apple-app.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035728&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FHelen-Sloan-HBO-Photo-61.jpg", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_850,h_560,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FHelen-Sloan-HBO-Photo-61-850x560.jpg", "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/fansided-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FHelen-Sloan-HBO-Photo-61.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Rodemerk", "S.C.
