Fogle was also ordered to pay $1.4 million in restitution to 14 victims and $175,000 in fines.\n\nPrison life hasn't been easy for the sandwich slinger. In March 2017, he was beaten by a fellow inmate, reported TMZ. The assailant, Steve Nigg, wrote a letter obtained by the tab explaining that he beat up Fogle because the spokesman is allegedly treated like a \"hero\" amongst other molesters and uses bodyguards to protect himself. \"Other child molesters looked at him as if he was a God,\" Nigg wrote. Despite being punished for the attack, Nigg wrote, \"I have no regrets.\"\n\nIn March 2018, Fogle made the news again when he and two fellow inmates filed a lawsuit against \"federal authorities and his former attorneys\" for what one of the men summarized to USA Today as \"constitutional violations, government overreach and convictions not based in the law.\" Fogle specifically alleged that he was duped into a guilty plea by \"bogus conspiracy charges\" brought by prosecutors. He also stated that the restitution he paid to victims was a result of \"coercion\" by his attorneys, which amounted to \"wire fraud, racketeering and 'money laundry.'\" As of this writing, there are no updates on the lawsuit. But good luck with all of that.", "images": ["https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/why-quiznos-rules-exhibit-a-1543945636.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Baker", "Mariel Loveland"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/74842/celebrities-currently-jail/", "title": "Celebrities who are currently in jail", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "title": "Celebrities who are currently in jail", "description": "These stars made big splashes in the world of sports, acting, and music, but bad decisions changed the course of their careers and landed them behind bars.
