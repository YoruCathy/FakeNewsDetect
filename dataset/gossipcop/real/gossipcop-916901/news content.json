Janney played Tonya Harding\u2019s abusive mother LaVona, who bullies her relentlessly throughout the film, while still providing comedic relief. Janney\u2019s dry, snappy performance was heavily praised by critics. She beat out others in the category, including Lesley Manville in Phantom Thread, Laurie Metcalf in Lady Bird, Octavia Spencer in The Shape of Water, and Mary J. Blige in Mudbound.\n\nJanney began her acceptance speech with a joke: \u201cI did it all by myself.\u201d It got a significant laugh, but she quickly added, \u201cNothing further from the truth.\u201d She thanked her castmates and even the squawking, ear-biting bird who became her humorous foil in the film.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSUS0SG6rRQg-zR0Fz8Y-KrNN1w=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10343355/927289568.jpg.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDAm9vsVaMZ_KPygRvPHSNa--h0=/0x0:3000x1980/1200x800/filters:focal(1294x422:1774x902)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58903093/927289568.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSUS0SG6rRQg-zR0Fz8Y-KrNN1w=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10343355/927289568.jpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shannon Liao", "Mar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/4/17079534/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-oscars-2018", "title": "Allison Janney wins Best Supporting Actress Oscar for I, Tonya", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "published_time": "2018-03-04T21:57:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-04T21:57:50-05:00"}, "author": "Shannon Liao", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/e8584abde1fc118cbb44d8e68e9902bc/tools.css", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Allison Janney just took home an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in I, Tonya.
