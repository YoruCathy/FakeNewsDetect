Of course includes @olympiaohanian they say save the best for last. I could not choose so I just choose 10 random videos. They all were so cute to me,\u201d Williams wrote on Instagram with a slideshow of adorable clips, including one funny moment when Ohanian carries his daughter like a \u201cbaby football.\u201d\n\nIn addition to all the fun moments on Instagram, the 36-year-old athlete returned to the tennis court on Saturday to play her first match since giving birth in September. Williams, who rocked the court in an all-black ensemble, lost 10-5 to Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAfter her match on Saturday, Williams admitted it felt a bit strange to return to the court, sharing that motherhood was still at the top of her mind. \"Motherhood is phenomenal...I was a little worried out there. I looked at my camp and was like 'is Olympia okay?'\u201d she related in a post-match interview.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSerena Williams and Kevin Hart Celebrate First Christmases With Their Newborns -- See the Cute Pics!\n\nSerena Williams' Daughter 'Hits the Gym' With Her Dad -- See the Adorable Pic!\n\nSerena Williams Reveals She Gets 'Emotional' Thinking About Ending Breastfeeding", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-11/serena_williams.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=89lhoZUj", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_williams.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=Fw25TS7D"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_williams.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=Fw25TS7D", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stacy Lambe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-shares-her-10-favorite-videos-daughter-alexis-olympia-93341", "title": "Serena Williams Shares Her 10 Favorite Videos of Daughter Alexis Olympia", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Serena Williams Shares Her 10 Favorite Videos of Daughter Alexis Olympia | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-shares-her-10-favorite-videos-daughter-alexis-olympia-93341", "title": "Serena Williams Shares Her 10 Favorite Videos of Daughter Alexis Olympia", "description": "The tennis star couldn\u2019t just choose one, so she shared 10 super cute moments of her four-month-old daughter.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_williams.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=Fw25TS7D", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The tennis star couldn\u2019t just choose one, so she shared 10 super cute moments of her four-month-old daughter.", "title": "Serena Williams Shares Her 10 Favorite Videos of Daughter Alexis Olympia", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Stacy Lambe\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-shares-her-10-favorite-videos-daughter-alexis-olympia-93341", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_williams.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=Fw25TS7D"}, "description": "The tennis star couldn\u2019t just choose one, so she shared 10 super cute moments of her four-month-old daughter.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Serena Williams", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
