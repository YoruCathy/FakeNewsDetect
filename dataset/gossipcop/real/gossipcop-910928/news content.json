And that\u2019s what was happening. Very short-lived, very small, but very impactful. And it really messed me up. I\u2019m trying to put this the best way possible: It wasn\u2019t like I was the only person on her mind. And I think I knew that going in \u2014 what I was getting myself into.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cOne Call Away\u201d singer and Disney alum, 25, had a brief fling in March 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious, but she\u2019s super into him,\u201d an insider told Us Weekly about their relationship at the time.\n\nDespite going through a rough patch, Puth has no problem performing his duet with Gomez. \u201cYou gather up a bunch of emotion with the life shovel, throw it in the life bucket, mix it up. And she evoked such good emotion on that song, it was a pleasure working with her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always happy to sing it, even though it came from a dark point in my life,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\nWhile Puth was briefly linked to Bella Thorne in December 2016, Gomez reunited with on-again, off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber this past November. Us Weekly broke the news of their reunion just days after her split with The Weeknd. \u201cSelena and The Weeknd just fizzled and ended amicably \u2014 it wasn\u2019t dramatic and it wasn\u2019t about Justin. But Selena always had feelings for Justin,\u201d a source told Us at the time. \u201cHer friends want her to be cautious because she has been in such a good place post-surgery.\u201d As previously reported, Gomez underwent a kidney transplant earlier this year due to complications with lupus, the autoimmune disease she was diagnosed with in 2013.\n\nThe couple were most recently spotted together on Wednesday, January 31. After Gomez watched Bieber\u2019s hockey game, the duo attended a Hillsong Church service together.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/501007472_charlie-puth-selena-gomez-zoom.jpg?crop=94px%2C0px%2C1802px%2C947px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/501007472_charlie-puth-selena-gomez-zoom.jpg?crop=283px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C869px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/charlie-puth-billboard-cover-zoom.jpg?w=231", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/501007472_charlie-puth-selena-gomez-zoom.jpg?crop=94px%2C0px%2C1802px%2C947px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlie-puth-says-selena-gomez-romance-messed-him-up/", "title": "Charlie Puth Says Selena Gomez Romance \u2018Messed\u2019 Him Up", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Charlie Puth opened up about his brief romance with Selena Gomez during a new interview \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Charlie Puth: Selena Gomez Romance \u2018Messed\u2019 Me Up", "description": "Charlie Puth opened up about his brief romance with Selena Gomez during a new interview \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlie-puth-says-selena-gomez-romance-messed-him-up/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T20:58:47+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/501007472_charlie-puth-selena-gomez-zoom.jpg?crop=94px%2C0px%2C1802px%2C947px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/501007472_charlie-puth-selena-gomez-zoom.jpg?crop=94px%2C0px%2C1802px%2C947px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-01T19:41:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T20:58:47+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Charlie Puth opened up about his brief romance with Selena Gomez during a new interview \u2014 get the details", "title": "Charlie Puth: Selena Gomez Romance \u2018Messed\u2019 Me Up", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/501007472_charlie-puth-selena-gomez-zoom.jpg?crop=94px%2C0px%2C1802px%2C947px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517514094.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
