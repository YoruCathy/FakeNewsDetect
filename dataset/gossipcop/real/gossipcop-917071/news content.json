This is because [clears throat for spoilers] according to writer and director James Gunn, the Groot we knew is dead. At the end of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot wraps his tree-limbs into a sturdy wooden bubble to protect his pals as their ship falls from the sky. When it crashes, he shatters into a pile of kindling. His friends mourn, his partner Rocket plucks a twig from the wreckage, and regrows Groot into a dancing sprout. By the end of the second Guardians movie, Baby Groot is growing up.\n\nAccording to director James Gunn, however, that wasn\u2019t Groot using his neat regeneration powers, and he\u2019s never going to grow back into the original Groot. Protesting a tweet asking \u201cWho would you save, Baby Groot or a porg?\u201d he points out that Baby Groot is an entirely new being that is, at best, a son.\n\nFirst Groot is dead. Baby Groot is his son. \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Gunn has mentioned this tidbit, which never fails to get Guardians of the Galaxy and Groot fans worked up. In a 2017 Facebook post, Gunn wrote, \u201cI do think it\u2019s more obvious in Vol. 2, as Baby Groot has a different personality than Groot, none of his memories, and is much, much dumber.\u201d When the issue resurfaced today, Gunn lamented on Twitter, \u201cThe internet is like Groundhog Day every time I point out first Groot died.\u201d This time, however, the news seems to have gone viral, leading Gunn to repeatedly emphasize the point to people asking questions and freaking out.\n\nOf course they are. Would you think an infant was your dead grandfather? That little jerk has not clue what\u2019s going on. \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s canon AF (and it\u2019s in the movies). \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018\n\nGiven that Guardians of the Galaxy takes place in a fictional universe that includes talking raccoons, a scientific analysis may be beside the point. But if I were to push up my glasses here and talk about the technicalities, I might mention that asexual plant reproduction \u00e0 la stem-cutting \u2014 like Rocket growing a new Groot from a twig \u2014 would actually qualify as a clone. That\u2019s because the new plant is genetically identical to the original, which means it\u2019s not necessarily offspring. But I\u2019m not here to get into a science fight!\n\nWhat I do take issue with is Gunn implying that everyone who is shocked by this news is a dummy. James, my man, it is certainly not clear from the first film that the Groot sprout is not, in fact, the old Groot. Groot shows off his regenerative powers early in the film; the principle of Chekov\u2019s gun would lead us, as viewers, to assume these facts are related. As for why Baby Groot is so stupid in the second film? I mean\u2026 he has a tiny baby brain. Have you ever met a baby? They\u2019re dumb.\n\nGunn wants Groot\u2019s sacrifice in the first film to carry weight. But this Groundhog Day-style revelation he talks about muddies the revelatory waters. If he is in fact introducing a new Groot at the end of the first film, the timing is confusing at best. Offering up a cuter, tinier version of the same character in the credits is an emotional salve to heal up the wounds caused by Groot\u2019s death before anyone leaves their seats, whether it\u2019s a son, a clone, or just a great merchandising opportunity.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99WUPvdrLIQ20euntmxrdwzOS20=/0x0:1200x628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8378039/baby-groot-guardians.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xddVMltvqjB3PEgF4OnOQifZvZs=/0x0:1200x696/1200x800/filters:focal(535x82:727x274)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58843699/baby-groot-guardians.0.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99WUPvdrLIQ20euntmxrdwzOS20=/0x0:1200x628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8378039/baby-groot-guardians.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Farokhmanesh", "Feb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059832/groot-is-dead-james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy-does-it-matter", "title": "James Gunn says Baby Groot is Groot\u2019s son, but does that matter?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "published_time": "2018-02-27T17:59:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-27T17:59:17-05:00"}, "author": "Megan Farokhmanesh", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/e8584abde1fc118cbb44d8e68e9902bc/tools.css", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "James Gunn points out that Baby Groot is an entirely new being that is, at best, a son, and not the original Groot.", "og": {"description": "Is it a good reveal if he has to keep explaining it?", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/99WUPvdrLIQ20euntmxrdwzOS20=/0x0:1200x628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8378039/baby-groot-guardians.0.jpg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "The Verge", "title": "James Gunn says Baby Groot is Groot\u2019s son, but does that matter?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059832/groot-is-dead-james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy-does-it-matter"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059832/groot-is-dead-james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy-does-it-matter", "title": "James Gunn says Baby Groot is Groot\u2019s son, but does that matter?", "description": "Is it a good reveal if he has to keep explaining it?", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9w9dBmusXXf3LvJYagUbemXHSTI=/0x0:1200x600/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8378039/baby-groot-guardians.0.jpg", "site": "verge"}, "sailthru.title": "James Gunn says Baby Groot is Groot\u2019s son, but does that matter?", "sailthru.tags": "general,the-verge,front-page,tldr,entertainment,film,marvel,culture", "sailthru.description": "James Gunn points out that Baby Groot is an entirely new being that is, at best, a son, and not the original Groot.", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-27T17:59:17-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rd5nBWQ1UMgDFu-Fz7n2TzrIUJo=/0x0:1200x675/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58843695/baby-groot-guardians.0.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6iVLHv4FmBJ4ylholnw-kfHTERk=/283x0:979x696/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58843695/baby-groot-guardians.0.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7396113/221a67c8-a10f-11e6-8fae-983107008690.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#393092", "outbrainsection": "culture"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519660800.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
