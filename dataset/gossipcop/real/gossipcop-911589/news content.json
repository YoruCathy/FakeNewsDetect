He quickly stopped the video he was recording and raced to open the camera app on his iPhone.\n\n\u201cI just thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019ll never get this opportunity again in my whole life,'\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI just went for it.\u201d\n\nWATCH IT AGAIN: Justin Timberlake\u2019s Super Bowl halftime\n\nIn that moment, little Ryan McKenna went viral.\n\n\u201cMy phone started blowing up,\u201d father John McKenna said. \u201cIt died, like, instantly after it happened. We had friends from all over reaching out. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nMcKenna is a seventh-grader at Derby Academy in Hingham, Mass. He flew in around noon on Sunday and the family had plans to fly out early on Monday morning. That is, if McKenna\u2019s suddenly busy schedule permits it. He\u2019s already scheduled to do a hit on Good Morning America, so that might affect the original flight plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so crazy,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to think. All my friends have been texting me and stuff. It\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nREVIEW: Halftime show falls flat, despite assist from marching band and Prince\n\n\u201cMy phone is almost dead,\u201d McKenna added. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so many notifications. I\u2019ve got like 36 Snapchats, like 21 DMs, and like 150 follower requests on Instagram.\u201d\n\nAs his son fielded questions from reporters, all John McKenna could do was shake his head.\n\n\u201cWe had the great opportunity to come see the Super Bowl,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in a million years did we think this would happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was already crazy to be at the Super Bowl in the first place,\u201d Ryan McKenna added. \u201cThen all of a sudden I\u2019m up on the jumbotron and everyone is talking about me. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image_40037873-e15178054866331.jpg?w=1024&h=576"], "top_img": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/image_40037873-e15178054866331.jpg?w=1024&h=576", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dane Mizutani", "Minnesota Wild Reporter", "Dane Mizutani Is Hawaii", "Somehow Ended Up Covering The Wild In The State Of Hockey.
