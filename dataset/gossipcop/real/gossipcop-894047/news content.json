She answered, \"[Expletive] off, Quiznos,\" leading Lawrence to share she had auditioned for the movie.\n\n\"I auditioned for Easy A. I wanted it so bad,\" Lawrence confessed.\n\n\"Well, guess what?\" Stone responded before joking, \"You didn't get it. You didn't get it because you suck!\"\n\nEasy A helped skyrocket Stone to fame, while Lawrence would instead star in Winter's Bone, the X-Men reboot films and The Hunger Games movies. The pair said in the interview that they have discussed a future collaboration.\n\n\"I would love to. I keep trying to convince her,\" Stone said. \"I have so many ideas.\"\n\n\"There is one idea that's floating around, but it's a secret,\" Lawrence confirmed.\n\nStone will next star in The Favourite with Joe Alwyn, while Lawrence is slated for Red Sparrow. The pair's interview follows Gossip Girl producer Josh Schwartz's revelation that Lawrence auditioned to play Serena Van Der Woodsen on The CW series.", "images":
