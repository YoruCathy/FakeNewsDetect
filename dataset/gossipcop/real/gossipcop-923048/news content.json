Joseph is even new to the competition and managed to make it to the final four, so we do not count him out of a potential spot in the final two. Anything could happen!", "images": ["https://dailynews.news/public/img/logodailynes.png", "https://dailynews.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rs_600x600-180305143429-600-alpha-male-madness-top-4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://dailynews.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rs_600x600-180305143429-600-alpha-male-madness-top-4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://dailynews.news/alpha-male-madness-2018-vote-in-the-final-4", "title": "Alpha Male Madness 2018: Vote in the Final 4 \u25b7DailyNews", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"url": "https://dailynews.news/alpha-male-madness-2018-vote-in-the-final-4", "type": "website", "title": "Alpha Male Madness 2018: Vote in the Final 4 \u25b7DailyNews", "description": "Alpha Male Madness 2018: Vote in the Final 4 \u25b7DailyNews", "image": "https://dailynews.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rs_600x600-180305143429-600-alpha-male-madness-top-4.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://dailynews.news", "summary": ""}
