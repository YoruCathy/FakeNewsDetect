{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey-all-the-money-in-the-world", "text": "On November 8, word broke that Ridley Scott planned to re-shoot several scenes in his upcoming fact-based hostage thriller, All the Money in the World, in order to excise the scandal-plagued Kevin Spacey from the film\u2014even though Scott still intends to release the movie December 22. Less than a week later, even the actor replacing Spacey\u2014Christopher Plummer\u2014is still reeling from the news.\n\nThe sudden swap and race against time is a welcome challenge for Plummer, he said\u2014but the veteran actor also feels \u201cawfully sad\u201d for Spacey, given the snowballing sexual-misconduct allegations against the House of Cards star.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very sad what happened to him. Kevin is such a talented and a terrifically gifted actor, and it\u2019s so sad. It\u2019s such a shame,\u201d Plummer told Vanity Fair at the premiere of his latest film, The Man Who Invented Christmas, in New York on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say, because that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nPlummer, who turns 88 a week before the release of All the Money, said he received a call from Scott offering him the part last week. The Sound of Music star did not have trepidation in taking on the role of billionaire J. Paul Getty, he said, despite the circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not replacing him [Spacey]\u2014it\u2019s starting all over again. Although the situation is very sad,\u201d said Plummer. \u201cI\u2019m very saddened by what happened to Kevin, but what can I do? I\u2019ve got a role. I admire Ridley Scott and I\u2019m thrilled to be making a movie for him. And so I thought, that was it. Ages ago I was in contention for [the role], way back. So I was familiar with it, and then Ridley came to me and I agreed. I wanted to work with him. He\u2019s very good. I loved the script. The script is wonderful.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar winner said he has not spoken with Spacey since the switch went public. Plummer did reveal that he begins re-shoots on Nov. 20, and will be shooting for about 10 days straight in Rome and London. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough, but it\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s worth getting a go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m used to big roles and lots of words.\u201d\n\nThe legendary actor is ready for the grueling schedule and the daunting task ahead. He has already begun memorizing his lines, and studies the film\u2019s script whenever he has any downtime during his press tour for The Man Who Invented Christmas, which opens in theaters on Nov. 22. \u201cI have to start because I don\u2019t have a day off,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nPlummer also confirmed that some of his scenes will involve Mark Wahlberg, who plays J. Paul Getty\u2019s lawyer, and Michelle Williams, the mother of kidnapped John Paul Getty III.\n\n\u201cThey stayed and agreed to do it all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable. All of this is remarkable.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a04dc065d31000f5dd2eddc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Week-in-Fashion-111017-SS02.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a099631706c760cc24cfbca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey-man-invented-christmas.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a04dc06a5d94677ed93cb71/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Week-in-Fashion-111017-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f781befc61cd2370957895/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Spacey-Comments.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/584b0c5769ece87a5836ae5b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/HWDDaily_newsletter_web.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a0216144cddea6e35171f25/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-NYPL-Talese-Whitehead.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a099631706c760cc24cfbca/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey-man-invented-christmas.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a04dc06e8216d6da983dc29/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Week-in-Fashion-111017-SS01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a099631706c760cc24cfbca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey-man-invented-christmas.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Chi", "Paul Ch", "Yohana Dest", "H.W.
