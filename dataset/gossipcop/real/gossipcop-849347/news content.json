Photo: Hulu\n\nSpoilers ahead for Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\nA few minutes into her first scene in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Alexis Bledel holds an orange. It\u2019s a relatively insignificant moment, but it struck me, since, in her years of playing Rory Gilmore on Gilmore Girls, Bledel always seemed visibly uncomfortable with props. This hit a flash point when, in the awkwardly Photoshopped posters for Netflix\u2019s Gilmore revival, it appeared that she had no idea how to hold everyday objects (I snidely tweeted about this, and Bledel later defended herself on national television). Bledel\u2019s an easy target. She never quite shed her Rory persona, nor the sense you got in Gilmore Girls\u2019s Stars Hollow that she was always in a daze watching the show\u2019s Mach-five dialogue whiz by her. But in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s oppressive, anxiety-inducing dystopia, Bledel is somehow right at home. You can see the fear in her eyes, the flickering resolve in her nervous composure, and a kind of punctured sadness in her posture. She even holds oranges the right way.\n\nIn the Handmaid\u2019s pilot, Bledel\u2019s character, Ofglen, makes a 180 in the eyes of Elisabeth Moss\u2019s Offred. The two characters, who shop together but are the de facto property of two different men, suspect each other of being enthusiastic participants in Gilead\u2019s totalitarian state. \u201cI sincerely believe that Ofglen is a pious little shit with a broomstick up her ass,\u201d Offred says in voice-over as she approaches her companion with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s my spy and I\u2019m hers.\u201d With Bledel as Ofglen, you instinctively believe Offred\u2019s assessment. Hasn\u2019t she always seemed too perfect? Too brittle? Too willing to be a snitch? (Or was that Rory Gilmore?)\n\nCloser to the end of the pilot, as Offred and Ofglen recover from a brutal \u201cparticicution,\u201d they walk through town and end up stopping at what used to be an ice-cream shop. In a rare moment, they see each other\u2019s faces straight-on, reflected in the windowpane. \u201cThey had the most amazing salted caramel, it was better than sex,\u201d Ofglen says. \u201cLike, good sex.\u201d It\u2019s the closest thing anyone has made to a joke, and it punctures the distrust between them. They start to talk, for real. Ofglen, we learn, had a wife (which makes her a \u201cgender traitor\u201d in puritanical Gilead) and son before she was forced into servitude. Like Offred, she tried to escape and, like Offred, she always suspected her partner. \u201cIt was nice to finally meet you,\u201d she deadpans at the end of their conversation.\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s theocratic regime is built upon men\u2019s oppression of women, which further perpetuates women\u2019s distrust of each other. In the book, it takes much longer for Ofglen to reveal her hidden depths, but in Bledel\u2019s casting, the show gets the point across quickly. Even in Gilmore Girls, the actress always had a bit of an icy distance \u2014 which, while off-putting for some fans, worked to her advantage as Rory\u2019s sense of entitlement became more a part of her personality in the show\u2019s later seasons. While never one for witty banter, Bledel always felt more in her element when she tapped into Rory\u2019s darker side. Consider the way, when confronted by Lorelai about sleeping with the married Dean at the end of Gilmore Girls\u2019s fourth season, Bledel\u2019s Rory drifts between defensive humor (\u201call those Trojan jokes worked\u201d), defiance (\u201cI hate you for ruining this for me!\u201d), and, finally, despair.\n\nBledel didn\u2019t always get a chance to flex her dramatic muscles on Gilmore, nor in most of her other film and TV roles which she tended to play as Rory Gilmore\u2013alikes (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Post Grad) or woefully against that type (we don\u2019t need to talk about Sin City). Mad Men recruited Bledel to play a depressed housewife \u2014 a step in the right direction \u2014 but seemed too pleased with the trick of turning Rory into an emptied-out Donna Reed to ask much of her as an actress. The problem tended to be that the role that made Bledel recognizable never totally fit her abilities in the first place, but no one bothered to try getting her to do much else.\n\nBut Bledel finds new depths in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The show gives her plenty of material in Ofglen\u2019s false piety, and it\u2019s thrilling to watch her dig into it. Underneath her hood, her watery eyes glimmer with anxiety, even as she tries to carve out a little friendship with Offred. She has a winning, rusty sense of humor. And when, in later episodes, Ofglen submits to terrible punishments, Bledel\u2019s work becomes all the more potent. She doesn\u2019t crumple into histrionics; instead, she\u2019s eerily still, like a righteous doll. Ofglen isn\u2019t defeated, and she\u2019s definitely not pious, she\u2019s angry: You think you know her, but you couldn\u2019t be more wrong.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/11c/4b2/43ccca848c404695806b9faf2fe7968b12-21-alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/04/21/21-alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/11c/4b2/43ccca848c404695806b9faf2fe7968b12-21-alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale-role-she-was-born-to-play.html", "title": "Alexis Bledel As Ofglen in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Is the Role She Was Born to Play", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Alexis Bledel As Ofglen in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale Is the Role She Was Born to Play", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale-role-she-was-born-to-play.html", "description": "The actress reveals new depths as Ofglen.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/11c/4b2/43ccca848c404695806b9faf2fe7968b12-21-alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Alexis Bledel Is Great As Ofglen in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale", "description": "The actress reveals new depths as Ofglen.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/11c/4b2/43ccca848c404695806b9faf2fe7968b12-21-alexis-bledel-handmaids-tale.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@McHenryJD", "site": "@vulture"}, "description": "The actress reveals new depths as Ofglen.", "article": {"tag": "the handmaid's tale, hulu, tv, alexis bledel, rory no more, vulture homepage lede", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "sailthru.tags": "the handmaid's tale, hulu, tv, alexis bledel, rory no more, vulture homepage lede", "author": "Jackson McHenry", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493233560.0, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
