Over the weekend, the New York Times published a report revealing that O'Reilly had settled with an accuser for an astonishing $32 million shortly before the upstanding citizens at Fox News signed him to a $100 million contract extension in February\u2014a decision, one would presume, that it came to regret a few months later.\n\nO'Reilly, as usual, remains very, very mad about all of this. He continues to assert that no women complained about him during the entirety of his twenty-year tenure, and he punctuated his interview with the Times with things like \"This is horrible!\" and \"This is crap!\" and other normal things that well-balanced people say when they definitely didn't do the horrible things they've been accused of doing. On Monday, Megyn Kelly, a former O'Reilly colleague who left in January for NBC, went on the air to dispute his claims, reading from evidence obtained from a source she knows well: herself.\n\nKelly was one of the highest-profile alleged harassment victims of the late Roger Ailes, the former Fox News CEO who abruptly left the network in July 2016. (Sorry, keeping track of the men at Fox News who have resigned in disgrace amidst similar-sounding scandals is admittedly a challenging task.) During a November interview, a visibly incensed O'Reilly dismissed Kelly's accusations against Ailes by stating that he was \"not interested\" in \"litigating something... that makes my network look bad.\" In response, Kelly says she wrote to Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernathy, criticizing O'Reilly for \"shaming women into shutting the hell up on grounds that it will disgrace the company.\" Shine, Kelly reveals, called her and promised to \"deal\" with it.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-10-23%2520at%25202.25.15%2520PM.png", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-header.d739eb0c2af2cf500d0c7ebecd1d6597474e69aa.svg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-reverse.2fe772617ee3b7f2fc81c9f7237c17495b42eaee.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e5236b6d413fa363728/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-862911956.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-10-23%2520at%25202.25.15%2520PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jay Willis", "Jay Willi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts", "title": "Megyn Kelly Shares Her Complaints About Bill O'Reilly That Fox News Allegedly Ignored", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Jay Willis", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Megyn Kelly shared old complaints about Bill O'Reilly that she had sent to superiors at Fox News, who then allegedly ignored her.", "id": "59ee46a924789d7510df1e52", "keywords": "culture,megyn kelly,bill o'reilly,fox news,sexual harassment", "news_keywords": "culture,megyn kelly,bill o'reilly,fox news,sexual harassment", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59ee46a924789d7510df1e52", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Megyn Kelly shared old complaints about Bill O'Reilly that she had sent to superiors at Fox News, who then allegedly ignored her.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "She read from her old complaints about Bill O'Reilly on the air.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-10-23%2520at%25202.25.15%2520PM.png", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Megyn Kelly Offers Rare Look Into How Fox News Silences Alleged Victims of Sexual Harassment", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "She read from her old complaints about Bill O'Reilly on the air.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-10-23%2520at%25202.25.15%2520PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Megyn Kelly Offers Rare Look Into How Fox News Silences Alleged Victims of Sexual Harassment"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGGEefKbc4k"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
