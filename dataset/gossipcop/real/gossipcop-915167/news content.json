But to see people of all backgrounds wearing clothing that celebrates their heritage, taking pictures next to our posters with their friends and family, and sometimes dancing in the lobbies of theaters \u2014 often moved me and my wife to tears.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Black Panther' Will Hit $1 Billion at the Box Office - The Only Question Is When\n\nWith its record-obliterating $242 million President\u2019s Day opening weekend and $426 million global launch, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is all but guaranteed to surpass $1 billion at the worldwide box office.\n\nDown the road, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d could soon leave several major releases in the dust. A $100 million second weekend is a possible feat for this film, as this weekend\u2019s releases, \u201cGame Night\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation,\u201d aren\u2019t expected to open to more than $25 million. At that pace, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d could pass the domestic run for \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d as early as this coming Sunday and pass the domestic run for \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d the week after.\n\nAlso Read: 'Black Panther' Tops 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' With $242 Million 4-Day Opening\n\nAdditionally, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is all people have been talking about for weeks. The film holds a score of 96 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and has since received an A+ CinemaScore.\n\n\u201cBlack Panther\u201d stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya.\n\n\u201cThank you for giving our team of filmmakers the greatest gift,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe opportunity to share this film, that we poured our hearts and soul into, with you.\u201d\n\nRead Coogler\u2019s emotional letter below.", "images":
