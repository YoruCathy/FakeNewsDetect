Keys, who admitted to using natural deodorant, busted out an impressive tune about her husband, Swizz Beat's, less-than-enthusiastic response after borrowing the non-toxic stuff.\n\nAnd let's just say after hearing Legend's tongue-in-cheek jingle about an \"erection lasting four hours\", we know now that with wife Chrissy Teigen, he's cemented himself as one of the most entertaining stars in the biz. Legend and Teigen have proven their hilarity time and time again. Earlier this summer, Teigen joined her husband on stage during a concert and suffered a wardrobe malfunction that would have left anyone else red-faced and embarrassed \u2014 but not those two.", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/2017/08/16/john-legend-alicia-keys-carpool-karaoke-james-corden/", "title": "John Legend Sings About 4-Hour Long Erections on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "meta_data": {"description": "As James Corden puts it, John Legend could sing about anything and make it sound beautiful \u2014 and he did just that during the late-night host's famous Carpool Karaoke.Corden challenged John Legend and Alicia Keys to an improvised sing-along using goofy phrases like 'natural deodorant' and 'an [...]", "keywords": "Carpool Karaoke,John Legend,Alicia Keys, James Corden", "news_keywords": "Carpool Karaoke,John Legend,Alicia Keys, James Corden", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@PopCulture", "creator": "@PopCulture", "title": "John Legend Sings About 4-Hour Long Erections on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "description": "As James Corden puts it, John Legend could sing about anything and make it sound beautiful \u2014 and [...]", "image": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"}, "og": {"title": "John Legend Sings About 4-Hour Long Erections on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/2017/08/16/john-legend-alicia-keys-carpool-karaoke-james-corden/", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "As James Corden puts it, John Legend could sing about anything and make it sound beautiful \u2014 and [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tB-4fTz5DD8"], "publish_date": 1502812800.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
