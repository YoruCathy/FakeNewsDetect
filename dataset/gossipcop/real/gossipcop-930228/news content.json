The comedian showed off the latter, along with her flair for the dramatic, last night at the Time 100 Gala in an epic tribute to another Jones: Grace Jones, iconic supermodel known for envelope-pushing androgynous looks. Wearing a show-stopping white double-breasted tuxedo dress with a high hemline and even higher shoulder pads, Jones completed the transformation with black cat-eye sunglasses, navy lipstick, and the supermodel's signature flattop haircut.\n\nThe dress was a custom look created by Christian Siriano, who was one of the event's honorees. Siriano and Jones formed a close working relationship after the SNL cast member tweeted that no designers would dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters. Less than one day later, Siriano reached out and the duo began creating a custom, red, off-the-shoulder ballgown with major Vivian from Pretty Woman vibes. \"It takes a real designer to design for a real woman,\" Jones said at the time, adding, \"I feel amazing. Christian hooked me up! Christian Siriano hooked me up.\"\n\nJones seemed to know that her splashy tribute would be a hit. After the event, she took to Instagram to post her look. \"So did I pull it off or what??,\" she captioned a picture. \"'Pull up to the Bumper' bitches!! #gracejonesismyidol.\" She also posted a hilarious picture with Siriano at the event. \"Ok this was my favorite pic of the night!! Loved being your date So much fucking fun @csiriano! Congrats on becoming Time 100!!\" Jones also praised Jennifer Lopez and Shaun Mendes for their performances, but ultimately just wanted to pay tribute to her idol. \"And I got to look like Grace Jones!! I hope she saw it!!\"\n\nSee the full look, below.\n\nView photos Mark Sagliocco/WireImage/Getty Images More\n\nRead more about celebrities:\n\nNow, watch Lucy Hale try nine things she's never tried before:\n\nDon't forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tibj3Ma5O_EWKKuuRwROVQ--~B/aD0xMDkyO3c9MTUyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/8cda5752b5c8ca745e6d74560fde8fc4", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Qt2alyQQQK3h72l9Ug73NA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/8cda5752b5c8ca745e6d74560fde8fc4", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zD6E0JRkV_J7VIJlh6k6QQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/c2a5974cae5ac519832c0e0e54a809cf", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mO5aF7O.OCChsTRuoMf4Ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-08-05/32756470-5b59-11e6-adae-e73a6908a2d0_allure-a-100x100.png.cf.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/cv/api/default/20180328/PV_logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tibj3Ma5O_EWKKuuRwROVQ--~B/aD0xMDkyO3c9MTUyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/8cda5752b5c8ca745e6d74560fde8fc4", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647/https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/leslie-jones-paid-tribute-grace-192325308.html", "title": "Leslie Jones Paid Homage to Grace Jones With Her Hair and Makeup", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "referrer": "origin", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooLifestyle", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "At the Time 100 Gala, Leslie Jones wore a custom white Christian Siriano suit dress, styled her hair in a flattop, and wore a navy lip to pay tribute to iconic supermodel Grace Jones.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tibj3Ma5O_EWKKuuRwROVQ--~B/aD0xMDkyO3c9MTUyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/8cda5752b5c8ca745e6d74560fde8fc4", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tibj3Ma5O_EWKKuuRwROVQ--~B/aD0xMDkyO3c9MTUyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/8cda5752b5c8ca745e6d74560fde8fc4"}, "title": "Leslie Jones Paid Homage to Grace Jones With Her Hair and Makeup"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "Grace Jones, Leslie Jones, Christian Siriano", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=15cacf2d-3411-33b3-aca3-7c5b8574716a&src=web", "description": "At the Time 100 Gala, Leslie Jones wore a custom white Christian Siriano suit dress, styled her hair in a flattop, and wore a navy lip to pay tribute to iconic supermodel Grace Jones.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647im_/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tibj3Ma5O_EWKKuuRwROVQ--~B/aD0xMDkyO3c9MTUyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/allure_895/8cda5752b5c8ca745e6d74560fde8fc4", "description": "At the Time 100 Gala, Leslie Jones wore a custom white Christian Siriano suit dress, styled her hair in a flattop, and wore a navy lip to pay tribute to iconic supermodel Grace Jones.", "title": "Leslie Jones Paid Homage to Grace Jones With Her Hair and Makeup", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427060647/https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/leslie-jones-paid-tribute-grace-192325308.html"}, "fb": {"app_id": 90376669494}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=15cacf2d-3411-33b3-aca3-7c5b8574716a&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=15cacf2d-3411-33b3-aca3-7c5b8574716a&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524684205.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
