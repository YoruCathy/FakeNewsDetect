The sign read, \"No guns, weapons of any type.\" Tarek added text to the snap, writing \"or helicopters,\" tagging his estranged wife and topping it off with a middle finger emoji.\n\n\n\nWATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Exes Tarek v. Christina El Moussa: It's a Battle of the Revenge Bods!\n\nThe reality star has since deleted the pic, but judging by what Christina posted to her Instagram on Friday, we imagine she wasn't too happy when she saw it.\n\nThe blond beauty shared a photo of the Empire State Building with the quote, \"No time for bullshit when you're building an empire.\"\n\n\"True that,\" she captioned it. Only surround yourself with the best \u2764\"\n\nBut that's not all! Tarek even gave the post a \"like.\"\n\nA source close to Tarek later told TMZ that his post was supposed to be a joke, and he tagged Christina thinking she would find it funny. The middle finger emoji was reportedly directed at the incident, not his co-star.\n\nOn Friday, Tarek tried to clear the air with an Instagram post that read, \"#life is about having #fun and enjoying every #moment....people shouldn't take things so seriously especially JOKES that are meant to be playful and fun...\"\n\nMany of Tarek's fans took to social media to express their support, writing things like, \"Reading the comments people leave you makes me realize how many sadly have no sense of humor,\" \"The fact that you're able to joke about your past means that you've already moved on... I admire your personality,\" and \"The only way to get through life is with a little humor!! Keep doing great things!!\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Tarek and Christina El Moussa's Shocking Split: Everything We Know About the 'Flip or Flop' Couple\n\nLast December, the couple confirmed they were taking a step back from their marriage following an incident on May, 23 2016 that led to the police being called to their Orange County, California, home. At the time, Tarek allegedly had a handgun and the Sherriff's Department responded to a report of a \"suicidal male\" with a helicopter.\n\nMore on that in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-05/christinaclapback_1280_hulu.jpg?itok=zYa-TV1T", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAA=", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-05/christinaclapback_1280_hulu.jpg?itok=zYa-TV1T", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217416_christina_el_moussa_claps_back_at_tarek_el_moussa_for_poking_fun_at_their_explosive_fight", "title": "Christina El Moussa Claps Back at Tarek El Moussa for Joking About Their Explosive Fight a Year Ago", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Christina El Moussa Claps Back at Tarek El Moussa for Joking About Their Explosive Fight a Year Ago | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217416_christina_el_moussa_claps_back_at_tarek_el_moussa_for_poking_fun_at_their_explosive_fight", "title": "Christina El Moussa Claps Back at Tarek El Moussa for Joking About Their Explosive Fight a Year Ago", "description": "The 'Flip or Flop' stars were seemingly feuding over Instagram this week.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-05/christinaclapback_1280_hulu.jpg?itok=zYa-TV1T", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 'Flip or Flop' stars were seemingly feuding over Instagram this week.", "title": "Christina El Moussa Claps Back at Tarek El Moussa for Joking About Their Explosive Fight a Year Ago", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Desiree Murphy", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217416_christina_el_moussa_claps_back_at_tarek_el_moussa_for_poking_fun_at_their_explosive_fight", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-05/christinaclapback_1280_hulu.jpg?itok=zYa-TV1T"}, "description": "The 'Flip or Flop' stars were seemingly feuding over Instagram this week.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
