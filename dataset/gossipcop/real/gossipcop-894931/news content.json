But rather than revealing her rumored rekindled love on the red carpet, Gomez debuted a brand-new hairstyle instead: The 25-year-old singer has a chic, icy platinum lob now.\n\nWhether the stunning new blond 'do is a permanent change or a temporary look for the AMAs is unclear\u2014especially considering six hours prior, Gomez had dark hair and blunt bangs, per her Insta story. But her longtime stylist Marissa Marino's Instagram gives us some clues: apparently Nine Zero One colorist Nikki Lee is the one responsible for Gomez's new hair, meaning she very well could have just joined Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande in the \"real fake blondes\" club. And Gomez also posted a photo with the caption, \"so i am blonde now\" on Instagram right before the show.\n\nThat said, it wouldn't be the first time she went temporarily blond this year. For her Bad Liar music video, Gomez debuted a bright blond, Farrah Fawcett\u2013like wig.\n\nBeyond the blond, Gomez is set to perform her new song \"Wolves\" at the 2017 AMAs, making it her first performance since receiving a kidney transplant due to complications from her struggle with lupus. The performance marks a major milestone for Gomez, on a stage where she's made several: Crying over Justin Bieber during \"The Heart Wants What It Wants\" back in 2014, delivering an inspiring speech post-treatment in 2016, and now returning from her latest health scare. \"The AMAs have been a place where I\u2019ve shared some of my most intimate moments,\" she wrote on Instagram earlier in the week, while teasing her \"Wolves\" performance.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n-Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Were Just Seen Kissing in Public\n\n-The Coolest Platinum-Blond Hair Inspo That'll Have You Calling Your Colorist\n\n-Selena Gomez's $1.99 Nail Polish Has an Important Secret Message", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1475708212/glamour_9-times-we-wanted-someone-to-look-at-us-the-way-selena-gomez-looks-at-taylor-swift.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5e860bb47d31b6000840b504/master/h_180%2Cc_limit/Glamour-BA2020-Logo-blk_3034x1148%252520(1).png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a1218079951b31ef0cb8a6a/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-876396354.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lynsey Eidell", "Lynsey Eidel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/selena-gomez-blonde-bob-american-music-awards-2017", "title": "Selena Gomez Debuts Blond Hair at the American Music Awards 2017", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Lynsey Eidell", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Selena Gomez arrived at the red carpet for the 2017 American Music Awards debuting a new platinum blonde bob.", "id": "5a1212229951b31ef0cb8a62", "keywords": "celebrity beauty,selena gomez,amas,american music awards", "news_keywords": "celebrity beauty,selena gomez,amas,american music awards", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a1212229951b31ef0cb8a62", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Selena Gomez arrived at the red carpet for the 2017 American Music Awards debuting a new platinum blonde bob.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a121c5b95a2ed7694d9b3a9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/SELENA-GOMEZ.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a121c5b95a2ed7694d9b3a9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/SELENA-GOMEZ.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "It looks SO good.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Selena Gomez Just Went Platinum Blond!", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/selena-gomez-blonde-bob-american-music-awards-2017"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "It looks SO good.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Selena Gomez Just Went Platinum Blond!"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
