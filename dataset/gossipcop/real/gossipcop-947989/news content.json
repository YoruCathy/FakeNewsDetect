Though when you\u2019re the daughter of not one but two celebrity parents, the internet can be doubly grueling and sometimes, downright cruel.\n\nAoki Lee, the 15-year-old daughter of Russell Simmons and Kimora Lee Simmons, recently opened up about online trolls and dealing with anxiety over being what people considered \u201cnot as pretty\u201d as her 18-year-old sister, Ming Lee. The youngest Simmons made an emotional statement on her Instagram stories sharing how she felt insecure about her appearance.\n\n\u201cI used to be very picky about pictures and not really show my face and would often not post pictures of cool events or important moments because I didn\u2019t like my smile or I was standing next to my beautiful sister,\u201d she shared in the since expired message, as E! News reports. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get insecure when your sister and mom are models.\u201d\n\nNowadays, however, she just wants her pics to reflect the times where she\u2019s happy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with a lot of negativity on Instagram, comments saying I\u2019m not as pretty as my big sister (who is the best by the way),\u201d she added. \u201cWe all want to look nice in our photos but I\u2019ve tried to let all of that go and just post pictures where I look happy or was actually having a good time. I try not to worry who I\u2019m standing next to and just share good moments with you guys.\u201d\n\nMing, who recently graduated from high school, reposted her little sister\u2019s message, saying, \u201cI literally aspire to be my sister.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the Simmons sisters and their mom are living their best lives in Greece.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1530289094/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-29%20at%2012.17.29%20PM-900x600.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rgb-TAG-Registered-80px.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1530289094/Screen Shot 2018-06-29 at 12.17.29 PM.png?width=840&height=1120"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1530289094/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-29%20at%2012.17.29%20PM-900x600.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/russell-kimora-lee-simmons-aoki-lee-anxiety-online-trolls/", "title": "Russell And Kimora Lee Simmons\u2019 Daughter Aoki Lee Speaks Out About Anxiety And Online Trolls", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Aoki says comments\u00a0from trolls who says \"I'm not as pretty as my big sister\" make her self-conscious about sharing photos online.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "<p>Russell and Kimora Lee Simmons\u2019 Daughter Aoki Lee Speaks Out About Anxiety And Online Trolls</p>", "description": "Aoki says comments\u00a0from trolls who says \"I'm not as pretty as my big sister\" make her self-conscious about sharing photos online.", "url": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/russell-kimora-lee-simmons-aoki-lee-anxiety-online-trolls/", "site_name": "Essence", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1530289094/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-29%20at%2012.17.29%20PM-900x600.png", "secure_url": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1530289094/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-29%20at%2012.17.29%20PM-900x600.png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/essence"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2453509358209265}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Aoki says comments\u00a0from trolls who says \"I'm not as pretty as my big sister\" make her self-conscious about sharing photos online.", "title": "<p>Russell and Kimora Lee Simmons\u2019 Daughter Aoki Lee Speaks Out About Anxiety And Online Trolls</p>", "site": "@essence", "creator": "@essence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-essence-fav-icon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.essence.com", "summary": ""}
