Yeah, she will.\u201d And then, referencing an oft-quoted barb from Ice Cube\u2019s Friday movie:\n\n\u201cBye, Felicia.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779140/author/andrew-kirell-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1513268707/171214-omarosa-strahan-tease_yiysih", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1513268707/171214-omarosa-strahan-tease_yiysih", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1513268707/171214-omarosa-strahan-tease_yiysih", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Senior Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/good-morning-america-host-robin-roberts-disses-omarosa-bye-felicia", "title": "\u2018Good Morning America\u2019 Host Robin Roberts Disses Omarosa: \u2018Bye, Felicia\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "\u2018Good Morning America\u2019 Host Robin Roberts Disses Omarosa: \u2018Bye, Felicia\u2019", "keywords": "Donald J.
