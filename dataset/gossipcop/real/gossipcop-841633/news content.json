Check out the recaps of episodes 1 and 2 below!\n\nEpisode 1 \u2013 \u201cThe Long Game\u201d Recap from 3/11/2018\n\nIn the first episode of season 2, viewers are brought back to a seemingly happy Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) as she and her fianc\u00e9 Kyle West (Josh Henderson) attend their engagement party. Not all is as it seems though, as Megan continues to have flashbacks to her horrible time in the Institute. That\u2019s the Institute for the Higher Mind \u2013 you know, the place that Kyle\u2019s mentor Terence (Michael Vartan) founded.\n\nMegan\u2019s flashbacks and way of \u201cfaking it\u201d in all aspects of life have led to rifts in her relationships with Kyle and her agent Leslie (Autumn Reeser). Yet she continues her plan to take down the Institute, with the help of her friend Shaun (Carra Patterson) \u2013 because sometimes, the only way to take something down, is to take it over from the inside.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arrangment Episode 1 Photos\n\nEpisode 2 \u2013 \u201cSurface Tension\u201d Recap from 3/18/2018\n\nIn the second episode, there\u2019s another red carpet and even more drama as Megan collapses during the event. But who\u2019s \u2013 or what\u2019s \u2013 to blame? Kyle\u2019s insistent that it\u2019s not drugs; but Terence seems to be indifferent. Could he somehow be involved? It wouldn\u2019t be that far of a stretch considering the hold he already has over Kyle. I wonder if DeAnn (Lexa Doig) will ever draw a line between the two of them before it gets out of hand.\n\nKyle\u2019s movie on the other hand, has one kind of issue: his worries about being a first-time director. Kyle reveals to Megan that he\u2019s unsure of who he is as a director, since he\u2019s always been \u201chiding behind characters.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how to feel about being so exposed. So what will all this mean for \u2018Technicolor Highway?\u2019 Guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see!\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 2 Photos\n\nEpisode 3 \u2013 \u201cThe Sessions\u201d Recap from 3/25/18\n\nIn this episode, Megan (Christine Evangelista) and Terence (Michael Vartan) seem to grow closer during their one-on-one sessions. During their first meeting, they delve into their pasts. Well, actually Terence does most of the talking, while Megan\u2019s the one prying him with questions. She\u2019s pulling a \u201cTerence\u201d on Terence himself!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second meeting sees them acting way more casual, almost like they\u2019re friends or oddly close pals. These meetings are obviously limiting Megan\u2019s time with Kyle, and that can\u2019t be good given their track record this season alone. Megan\u2019s always with Terence, while Kyle takes his lead actor, Xavier (Ruffin Prentiss) under his wing.\n\nWe all know that Kyle just wants his first movie to be great, but how far will he go to make sure that happens? He seems to be very \u201con edge\u201d in this episode \u2013 which has led to yet another argument between he and Megan. Megan thinks Kyle\u2019s \u201cprojecting his fears\u201d onto her by not trusting her with this movie role; he thinks she\u2019s wrong. Never fear though, KyGan fans: they do make up. And Megan gave a killer performance her first day on set, I might add.\n\nOne relationship that\u2019s being further torn apart? Terence and DeAnn. Terence\u2019s time is being taken up by Megan and Shaun (Carra Patterson); while DeAnn (Lexa Doig) makes a decision regarding her affair with Mason (Garcelle Beauvais). But when DeAnn calls Mason to tell her the news, she receives some devastating news. But what exactly happened to Mason? Guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see!\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 3 Photos\n\nEpisode 4 \u2013 \u201cScene 23\u201d Recap from 4/1/18\n\nThere\u2019s tons of romance and revelations in this latest episode. You see Terence and DeAnn finally taking strides in their marriage as well as Kyle and Megan opening up to one another. Then it gets passionate as the vision Kyle has for \u201cTechnicolor Highway\u201d being brought to life. All while the ratings are starting to come in for his latest film, \u201cThe Kill Plan.\u201d Add in a new and old character and there you have episode 4 of \u201cThe Arrangement.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with Terence and DeAnn. They seem to be on the same page now in terms of what they want: a child! Can you believe it? Well, they sealed the deal, and they seem happy with their life right now. On the other side of things, DeAnn finally met her lover\u2019s son, Wes (played by newcomer Jacob Artist). Mason has unfortunately passed, and DeAnn has a hard time dealing with it. Wes comes into play to help her talk through it and be there for her. Things get a little weird though when he kisses DeAnn. Oops.\n\nKyle\u2019s got quite the duality going on right now: his latest film, \u201cThe Kill Plan\u201d is released to the fans, but critics aren\u2019t having it. It\u2019s sinking fast, and it causes Kyle to lose focus on his current project, \u201cTechnicolor Highway.\u201d Good thing Megan is there to help calm him. They finally get honest with each other on set and things seem better for them. Plus, Megan performs a killer scene for Kyle\u2019s movie, so it\u2019s a win-win!\n\nAs for the old character that comes back? Hope (Katharine Isabelle) \u2013 Megan\u2019s ex-friend. Megan asks Hope to meet with her because she believes Hope can get her more dirt on the Institute. Shaun doesn\u2019t approve, but Megan goes along with it anyway. Bad thing is, nothing pans out from Hope\u2019s tip. At least, not yet. Speaking of Shaun, she\u2019s been a bit preoccupied with Terence lately\u2026.well, his seminar, that is. Shaun strips down (literally and figuratively) and shows a side of herself viewers haven\u2019t seen before. Makes for an interesting scene \u2013 definitely a standout.\n\nSo will Megan finally get the dirt she needs to bring IHM down? And what about this Wes character? Will DeAnn have even more drama in her life? And what about Kyle\u2019s movie, will it keep running smoothly? Tune in next week to find out.\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 4 Photos\n\nEpisode 5 \u2013 \u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d Recap from 4/8/18\n\nThis episode has so many plots for each character or relationship, it\u2019s hard to keep track! First up: Kyle and Megan meet with Terence and DeAnn at a party, where all seems romantic for each couple. Although, according to DeAnn, \u201cmarriage is just temporary\u2026a negotiation.\u201d Megan and Kyle don\u2019t ever want to end up like that, but a rumor rocks their world and makes them question each other. Apparently, tabloids have reported that \u201cKygan\u201d is fake, and that Megan is in love with her co-star, Xavier. Both of which aren\u2019t true, but you know how it is in Hollywood. Causing even more tension for Kygan is the fact that Megan\u2019s been trying to convince Kyle that Terence has just been riding his coattails. Kyle still feels as though he owes Terence for making him what he is, so it\u2019s difficult for him to get out of Terence\u2019s control.\n\nSpeaking of control, Terence feels like he\u2019s losing it with DeAnn. You\u2019ve got DeAnn admitting her past with Mason (DeAnn\u2019s ex-girlfriend), which leaves Terence angry that DeAnn has such a love for her instead of him. Terence and DeAnn are hitting a wall, Terence is not able to get a handle on Megan, and Terence is losing grip on Kyle because of Megan. Sounds like things aren\u2019t good for Terence right now. One thing though that keeps coming around is Shaun. I don\u2019t know if their relationship is going to go past professional or not, but if it does, could Megan\u2019s plan for IHM\u2019s takedown be on the line? And what does Xavier supposedly being in love with Megan mean for Kyle\u2019s movie? Can Terence and DeAnn finally pull themselves together enough to bring a kid into the world?\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 5 Photos\n\nEpisode 6 \u2013 \u201cThe Break Up\u201d Recap from 4/15/18\n\nThis episode is special in a number of ways. First, you\u2019ve got the start of it with a flashback to Kyle\u2019s relationship with Lisbeth. Viewers see Kyle pacing back and forth, trying to get in contact with his then-girlfriend, only to find that she\u2019s left him because \u201cshe got lost in his world.\u201d Then we\u2019re brought back to the present day, where the flashback connects to Kyle talking about how his failed relationship relates to his parents\u2019 deaths (his mother from cancer and his father in a car accident). You\u2019ve got Kyle feeling on edge because of this interview he\u2019s conducting for IHM and because his movie isn\u2019t going as well as he\u2019d like. Terence isn\u2019t helping the situation by spewing his \u201cgive IHM energy and it\u2019ll give it back to you\u201d advice \u2013 and you can see that the relationship between he and Kyle is strained.\n\nMeanwhile, you\u2019ve got Kyle and Xavier in some weird competition to see who\u2019s the best, or who is right and wrong. This leads to Kyle and Megan fighting, as well as Kyle being jealous over Megan and Xavier spending time together. Viewers then get a look, presumably inside Kyle\u2019s head, as to why he feels this way: his arguments with Lisbeth over her last relationship with Gavin. You see a whole new side of Kyle that\u2019s dark and full of rage. We then cut to Megan\u2019s interview, where she seems to be all happy-go-lucky and sings the Institute\u2019s praises (as does her movie co-star, Xavier). Beneath the surface though, you can tell she wants to expose Terence, which is where Shaun came in to try and find info on the Institute. Yet there\u2019s no such animal (or so it seems), which leaves Megan internally frustrated.\n\nProbably one of the most jarring scenes is Kyle on his motorbike interspersed with flashbacks to his \u2013 surprise! \u2013 drug addiction. This ultimately led to a showdown between Kyle and Terence, that involved a gun. We see that Kyle was desperate and felt unloved, but Terence managed to talk him down. Another intense scene? A flashback from Terence\u2019s POV showed that he and Lisbeth were together \u2013 while she was still engaged to Kyle! They hooked up, and Terence even admitted to being in love with her for a long while. After their escapade, Terence goes to see Kyle and gets him to go to the Facility. What\u2019s crazy about this episode though is that during Kyle\u2019s interview about IHM, he sounds like a robot, repeating word for word what Terence told him about why he needed to go to the Facility. The episode closes with Kyle firing Xavier and Kyle thinking that he\u2019s got it all figured out. Little does he know, things haven\u2019t even begun to go down.\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 6 Photos\n\nEpisode 7 \u2013 \u201cOn Location\u201d Recap from 4/22/18\n\nWe start out with seeing the Kyle has in fact taken Xavier\u2019s part in \u201cTechnicolor Highway\u201d, alongside his fianc\u00e9 Megan. Then, Megan goes into an audition where she runs into her former agent, Leslie. Leslie tries to see through to Megan\u2019s real being, but she misses the mark when Megan puts up her \u201ceverything is fine\u201d wall. As for her audition? Megan didn\u2019t get the part, and it\u2019s all because the director didn\u2019t want IHM to bring drama to her set. In the first twist of the episode, the real reason Megan didn\u2019t get the part? Her team at Creative Partners pulled her out of the running! This revelation causes a huge fight between Megan and Kyle, because Kyle knew about the \u201cnon-compete\u201d agreement in the contract, but didn\u2019t inform Megan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey eventually make up by finally telling each other the truth about the contract\u2026. or so they thought. Turns out Kyle lied about the real reason behind the contract, per Terence\u2019s coaching. It\u2019s insane how much control he has over their whole relationship.\n\nAnother obstacle occurs when Kyle (along with half the crew) get food poisoning. Since he\u2019s unable to direct, it\u2019s up to DeAnn and Megan to make sure his vision stays alive. DeAnn even gets Leslie to help out since they\u2019re so short on camera assistants! DeAnn eventually listens to Leslie\u2019s advice, and it seems as though they finish the scene without any more disasters. A toast by the fireside and they (Leslie, DeAnn and Megan) leave all their issues behind.\n\nBack in LA, Shaun and Terence are still buddy-buddy, except for the fact that Terence is being sneaky with meetings and Shaun is lying to Zach about finding one of the victims of IHM\u2019s Facility. Terence is still trying to pitch this new idea of a \u201cmagic potion\u201d that supposedly gives this promise of immortality. He\u2019s even going the extra mile as to dig up dirt on investors in order to get them to sign off! The episode ends with Kyle and Megan truthfully making up when Megan spills that she wouldn\u2019t sign the contract if asked again. And Terence tells Shaun that he \u201cloves\u201d that she\u2019s completely herself\u2026. just as she breaks into the IHM database to find out where Julie Woolth (one of the IHM victims) is hiding. So, will Shaun be able to really help Megan? And what about Terence \u2013 will his reign over Kyle\u2019s life be broken down? Or will Kyle continue to follow his lead?\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 7 Photos\n\nEpisode 8 \u2013 \u201cPaso Robles\u201d Recap from 4/29/18\n\nThis episode is full of untold truths and so much drama. First, Kyle runs into Detective Gaffey \u2013 if you remember, he slept with her per Terence\u2019s convincing to keep things quiet regarding the IHM investigation \u2013 while Megan is right there. Talk about awkward. Also odd? The fact that Kyle then keeps having a recurring nightmare about someone trying to kill him. He seems to think it\u2019s related to Detective Gaffey, but Terence seems to think it\u2019s about \u201csomeone close betraying him.\u201d Which is it: a guilty conscience or a sign that something else is wrong?\n\nMeanwhile, Megan and Shaun go to Paso Robles, aka: \u201cwine country\u201d under the guise of her bachelorette party; when in reality, they\u2019re going to investigate Julie Woolth. When they meet her, she seems all too happy about her experience with IHM. But Megan doesn\u2019t seem to buy her story. Another story that might not be bought? Zach\u2019s reason for using a burner phone! Kyle caught him talking about \u201cJulie\u201d but Zach lies to him and Terence about who Julie is. Since Zach was really talking to Megan, she\u2019s freaking out because she assumes that Terence is going to find out the truth and ruin her.\n\nIn the biggest bombshell of the night, Julie\u2019s brother Aaron tells Megan the truth about IHM. Yes, the payments they got from Terence were hush money; but Kyle was the one who put Aaron in the wheelchair. He lost his ability to walk because Kyle lost out to a part in a movie. Terence covered it all up in his own twisted version of an \u201carrangement.\u201d What will this mean for Megan and Kyle? And what about Terence: will this be enough to finally take him down?\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 8 Photos\n\nEpisode 9 \u2013 \u201cTruth\u201d Recap from 5/6/18\n\nWe pick up right where we left off: Kyle comes clean about the night of Aaron\u2019s attack. Megan comes to the realization that the contract wasn\u2019t about her; it was about Kyle. As Kyle put it: \u201cSelf-preservation\u2026it\u2019s human nature.\u201d Megan finally told Kyle the truth about why she needed to find Julie: to ruin Terence. The new plan? To move Aaron and Julie into a new house to keep them away from Terence and IHM. Kyle finally comes to face to face with Aaron and ends up telling Megan that he\u2019ll always choose her. In a bombshell move, Kyle tells Terence and DeAnn (at the rehearsal dinner no less!) that he\u2019s leaving IHM.\n\nTerence gave a nice speech at the dinner, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make Kyle come crawling back. Or so Megan thought. Kyle really did get Zach out of the Facility; but Megan also thinks that Kyle was the one who told Terence where to find Julie and Aaron. Terence has made them disappear, but will Megan fall back into line like he wants? As for Kyle and Megan, they had a screaming match saying they can\u2019t trust each other anymore. Kyle tells Megan he had nothing to do with Aaron and Julie, but Megan\u2019s not buying it. Course, with each of them having lied so many times, how are they to know what the truth really is? What will that mean for the wedding?\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 9 Photos\n\nEpisode 10 (Season Finale) \u2013 \u201cSuite Revenge\u201d Recap from 5/13/18\n\nMegan wishes she could wake up in a different life\u2026.and her night with Xavier didn\u2019t make that happen. After talking with Xavier, she still doesn\u2019t know where she stands with everything. So when DeAnn reaches out saying she can \u201cget [Megan] out of this\u201d \u2013 Megan\u2019s all ears. Turns out, Leslie wasn\u2019t the one who got Megan that first audition with Kyle \u2013 DeAnn did. Megan goes through with the wedding \u2013 lovely gown and all \u2013 and becomes Mrs. Kyle West. Kyle and Megan share their first dance as a married couple and then run off together. It doesn\u2019t last long as Megan tells Kyle she only came back for the wedding, not for their relationship. She ends up escaping the limo and jetting off with Leslie. Talk about a runaway bride!\n\nThey come back together the next morning, although their relationship is still very strained by all the lies they\u2019ve told each other. To make matters worse, Terence and DeAnn have come up with a plan to make Megan disappear. And by disappear, they mean kill. Terence reiterates the plan to DeAnn, saying that they\u2019ll catch Megan as she comes into the hotel for a (fake) meeting and inject her, making everyone think she died of a drug overdose. The twist? DeAnn records Terence\u2019s admission and sends it to Megan.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle comes clean on who he really is. Oh, and as for getting blamed for moving Aaron and Julie? Not Kyle\u2019s fault. So, if not him, then who? Shaun. She confesses this to Megan, as well as the news that she\u2019s staying with IHM. The insane bombshell ending to this finale? Kyle finds out about Megan and Xavier, which leads him to come to a decision. He confronts Megan, telling her that she\u2019s going to follow the contract \u201cto the letter.\u201d As in, he has all the power now. Yeah, good luck with that. Megan has shown viewers that she can\u2019t be tamed.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping this show gets a season 3, because Kygan\u2019s got a lot more in store.\n\nThe Arrangement Episode 10 (Season Finale) Photos\n\nCheck back to this article for more recaps as the season continues.
