It is our responsibility to make moral decisions in difficult times and to give voice to inclusivity.\u201d\n\n\u2022 RELATED STORY: \u2018Hellboy\u2019 casting sparks \u2018whitewashing\u2019 storm: \u2018It just doesn\u2019t make sense\u2019\n\nFans and critics blasted the casting last week, saying it was another example of Hollywood \u201cwhitewashing\u201d a character that was originally intended to be Asian.\n\nAmong those critics was Guy Aoki, founding president of MANAA, the Media Action Network for Asian Americans \u2014 a media watchdog group based in Los Angeles.\n\nAoki appeared caught off guard by Skrein\u2019s swift about-face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleasantly surprised that Skrein volunteered to not do the role after understanding how much of an uproar it created in the Asian-American community. We want to thank him for that,\u201d Aoki said Monday. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a model for other [non-Asian] actors to follow. If you get offered a role that was supposed to be an Asian role, you might want to politely decline and suggest that they get someone who\u2019s more appropriate for it.\u201d\n\nMatt Donnelly, senior film reporter at Hollywood business website TheWrap.com, also praised the actor\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt makes Ed Skrein look really thoughtful and responsible, and sort of committed to making sure that diversity and people of different ethnic backgrounds are represented the right way in film,\u201d Donnelly said.\n\nProducers of \u201cHellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen\u201d suddenly found themselves off the hook after facing intense criticism over the casting, and thanked the actor.\n\n\u201cEd came to us and felt very strongly about this. We fully support his unselfish decision,\u201d producers Larry Gordon, Lloyd Levin, Millennium Films and Lionsgate said in a joint statement issued to the Southern California News Group. \u201cIt was not our intent to be insensitive to issues of authenticity and ethnicity, and we will look to recast the part with an actor more consistent with the character in the source material.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Hollywood has come under fire for hiring a non-Asian actor to play an Asian character. Among the other controversial castings were Emma Stone as a part-Hawaiian, part-Chinese woman in 2015\u2019s \u201cAloha\u201d and Scarlett Johansson as a cyborg in \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a 2017 remake of a Japanese anime film.\n\nEach of those castings ignited a firestorm of criticism on social media as well, and the films underperformed at the box office. While executives brushed off those previous controversies, Donnelly called the lightning-speed \u201cHellboy\u201d development a possible game-changer in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get to a point where this doesn\u2019t happen in the first place, the casting never goes down where you hire the white guy who\u2019s supposed to play an Asian character,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think the fact that it\u2019s been addressed so quickly is really promising.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ladn-no-margin.svg", "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/201708/NEWS_170829523_AR_0_ZZUDJKGRZRND.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/37bd654020f336322dbfbb8541bf35a5?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/201708/NEWS_170829523_AR_0_ZZUDJKGRZRND.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anita Bennett", "Matthew Carey", "Senior Editor", "Anita Bennett Is Senior Editor For The Los Angeles Daily News."], "canonical_link": "https://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20170828/ed-skrein-drops-out-of-hellboy-reboot-after-whitewashing-backlash", "title": "Ed Skrein drops out of \u2018Hellboy\u2019 reboot after \u2018whitewashing\u2019 backlash", "meta_data": {"application-name": "dailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "fb": {"pages": 55107646487}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ed Skrein drops out of \u2018Hellboy\u2019 reboot after \u2018whitewashing\u2019 backlash", "url": "https://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20170828/ed-skrein-drops-out-of-hellboy-reboot-after-whitewashing-backlash", "description": "A week after his casting in the upcoming \u201cHellboy\u201d film sparked a \u201cwhitewashing\u201d uproar, British actor Ed Skrein has decided to exit the project.\u201cI accepted the r\u2026", "site_name": "Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/201708/NEWS_170829523_AR_0_ZZUDJKGRZRND.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "width": 1024, "height": 670}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-29T00:08:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-01T15:41:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ladailynews", "text": {"title": "Ed Skrein drops out of \u2018Hellboy\u2019 reboot after \u2018whitewashing\u2019 backlash"}, "image": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/201708/NEWS_170829523_AR_0_ZZUDJKGRZRND.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/site-icon-ladn.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503849600.0, "source": "https://www.dailynews.com", "summary": ""}
