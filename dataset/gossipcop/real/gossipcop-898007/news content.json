News \u2014 and the \u201cLip Sync Battle\u201d personality apparently isn\u2019t too happy with her more loose-lipped friends either.\n\nTeigen fired up her Twitter wrath on Tuesday, calling out E! News for a report on her supposed \u201cpregnancy cravings.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring on the food! Chrissy Teigen\u2019s pregnancy cravings include cheeseburgers, fries, and anything spicy,\u201d E! News tweeted early Tuesday, with a link to a story bearing the title \u201cChrissy Teigen\u2019s Pregnancy Cravings Will Have You Begging for Junk Food.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Chrissy Teigen Apologizes for Nip-Slip: 'I Have Nipples. It's Not Something I'm Proud of' (Video)\n\nTeigen apparently found the story hard to swallow, and said as much in a reply to E! News.\n\n\u201cYou guys should do a service to all the celebs who give you hourly content and say who your sources are so we can get rid of the sh\u2013ty \u2018friends\u2019 in our lives who sell you stories,\u201d Teigen responded.\n\nTeigen has done battle with the media via Twitter in the past. In March, after Fox News published a story about her reaction to a story about story about United Airlines barring girls from flying because their leggings didn\u2019t comply with the airline\u2019s dress code for company benefit travel, Teigen pointedly asked them to refrain from tagging her on Twitter in the future.\n\nAlso Read: Chrissy Teigen Tells In Touch Magazine to 'Go F-- Yourselves' Over John Legend Breakup Report\n\n\u201cI respectfully ask you please don\u2019t ever tag me in anything, ever. Words cannot explain how much I detest you,\u201d Teigen, who has also had some choice words for In Touch in the past, wrote.\n\nFollowing Teigen\u2019s call-out to E! News, one Twitter user suggested that she use a bit of trickery to weed out her blabbermouth associates.\n\n\u201cYou better Tyrion Lannister these \u2018friends\u2019 and tell them all different stuff and see what leaks,\u201d a tweet suggested.\n\nAlso Read: Chrissy Teigen Steals Her Husband's Show With Onstage Nip-Slip (Video)\n\n\u201cI cannot lie without laughing. I\u2019m a very obvious liar,\u201d Teigen responded.\n\nClearly, Teigen is equally unable to mask her contempt for personal leaks.\n\nRead the exchange below.\n\nYou guys should do a service to all the celebs who give you hourly content and say who your sources are so we can get rid of the shitty \u201cfriends\u201d in our lives who sell you stories. https://t.co/3tb7fWtYyv \u2013 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 5, 2017\n\nI cannot lie without laughing.
