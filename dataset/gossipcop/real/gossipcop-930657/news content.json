One month before, in January, Teigen confirmed that the couple conceived their second child through IVF after she previously said \u201ca little boy is next.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Luna has a concept of exactly what it means to have a little sibling yet,\u201d Legend recently told PEOPLE of their eldest child becoming a sibling. \u201cShe\u2019ll figure it out sooner or later, and she\u2019ll probably have some moments where she regrets it! But we\u2019re excited.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nImage zoom\n\nMeanwhile, the baby shower came days after Legend and West\u2019s conversation that the rapper shared publicly amid the backlash to West\u2019s public support of Trump.\n\nDuring West\u2019s Twitter spree on Wednesday, Legend tweeted a cryptic message after West proclaimed his love for Trump, calling him \u201cmy brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cI imagine there\u2019s some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present,\u201d penned Legend. \u201cThinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn\u2019t exist. If history is erased, we don\u2019t have to deal with its consequences. However\u2026Far too many people don\u2019t have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can\u2019t act like what they see and know doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nHowever, at the shower, West and Legend appeared to enjoy each other\u2019s company as West shared a selfie from the shower along with the caption, \u201cWe got love.
