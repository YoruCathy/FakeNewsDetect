And just like Kate Middleton before her, she was given a royal title on the day of her nuptials\u2014as was Prince Harry.\n\nKensington Palace tweeted Saturday morning that the Queen was \u201cpleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s new title is His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and after marriage, Meghan Markle\u2019s title is Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.\n\nShe is the first woman to be known as the Duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry is the second Duke of Sussex. Prince Augustus Frederick, who campaigned against slavery, was the only other person to hold the title.\n\nJust like Prince William was given the title of Duke of Cambridge on his wedding day, it was expected that Queen Elizabeth would also bestow a dukedom on Prince Harry to commemorate his nuptials. It was previously speculated that the vacant Dukedom of Sussex had been reserved for Harry, who will also retain the title of Prince Henry of Wales.\n\nWhen Kate married Prince William on April 29, 2011, she received the title of Duchess of Cambridge to go along with the dukedom William was granted by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nBut after the royal wedding, there are still other ways to refer to Meghan Markle. Here\u2019s what we know about how and why the royals end up with certain names and titles.\n\nPrince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady\u2014PA Wire\n\nWhat is Prince Harry\u2019s last name?\n\nBefore we talk about Meghan, let\u2019s first get to the bottom of what exactly Prince Harry\u2019s last name is.\n\nHenry Charles Albert David, familiarly known as Prince Harry, was born to Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, on Sept. 15, 1984. Harry was born into the House of Windsor and his last name is technically Mountbatten-Windsor\u2014as is the case for all royals who are descended from Queen Elizabeth II through the male line.\n\nHowever, last names are typically only used by members of the royal family without titles, meaning Mountbatten-Windsor is pretty much never tacked onto Harry\u2019s name.\n\nDuring his time at school and in the military, Prince Harry was known simply as Harry Wales, a surname that derived from his father\u2019s official title. Today, he is typically referred to as Prince Harry, or more formally, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.\n\nWhat is Meghan Markle\u2019s new title after marrying Prince Harry?\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s marriage to Prince Harry does not make her a princess, as only women that are born into the royal family, like Princess Charlotte, hold that title. Instead, Meghan is now a duchess since Harry, as is tradition, was granted a dukedom on their wedding day.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that Meghan\u2019s official title is Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex and she will never be a princess in her own right, she may still be referred to by the royal title in reference to her husband, i.e., HRH Princess Henry of Wales.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, (left) arrives with his best man Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in Windsor, on May 19, 2018.

However, considering royals tend to be known only by their first names, it\u2019s not likely you\u2019ll see her addressed by that name very often.\n\nJust as Kate Middleton is mainly referred to by her maiden name or the title she was given by Queen Elizabeth at her wedding to Prince William, Duchess of Cambridge, Markle will likely only add Duchess of Sussex\u2014the dukedom Prince Harry has been granted\u2014to her current moniker.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018.

Unless Queen Elizabeth issues a Letters Patent declaring otherwise, Harry and Meghan\u2019s children will be lords and ladies.\n\nThis is due to a 1917 Letters Patent issued by King George V, that limited the titles of a sovereign\u2019s grandchildren. It read as follows: \u201c\u2026the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.\u201d\n\nBasically, Prince William\u2019s oldest son, Prince George, was the only grandchild that was ever guaranteed the title of prince. However, when Kate was pregnant with Charlotte, the Queen issued a new Letters Patent stating that all of the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales would receive the title of prince or princess.\n\nShe could very well do the same for Harry and Meghan\u2019s children.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the royal family use a last name?\n\nThe royal family\u2019s naming practice may seem complicated, but the reason behind it is relatively simple: The royals are typically so well known that they don\u2019t need a last name to be recognized.\n\n\u201cMembers of the Royal Family can be known both by the name of the Royal house, and by a surname, which are not always the same,\u201d the official royal website reads. \u201cAnd often they do not use a surname at all.\u201d\n\nWhat do we call Kate Middleton?\n\nKate Middleton officially became Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge when Prince William was granted the Dukedom of Cambridge on their wedding day. She can also be referred to as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and HRH Princess William of Wales, as well as the more casual Catherine Cambridge or Catherine Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nIn addition, William and Kate hold the titles of Earl and Countess of Strathearn in Scotland and Baron and Baroness of Carrickfergus in Ireland.\n\nGet The Brief.
