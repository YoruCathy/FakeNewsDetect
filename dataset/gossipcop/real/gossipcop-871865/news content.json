Look \u2013 they get engaged in the trailer!\n\nChris says he knew she was 'The One' immediately. But annoyingly she was married to actor Ben Indra at the time.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to marry her pretty soon [after I met her,]\u201d he told PEOPLE. \u201cIt took a while for me to admit it, because it would be crazy to be like, \u2018I want to marry you\u2019 the first day I met her. But I could have!\u201d\n\nChris and Anna in 2008 Getty Images\n\nHe added in an interview with Elle, \"We were friends first, but she left her husband at the end of the movie, and we started dating when we were back in LA. So we were friends, and I was there for her. And we had just played love interests, so we had this tight bond spending so much time and spending nights in Phoenix, but we never crossed the line. But we were, I think, developing feelings for each other at the time, you know? The day that she told me she was leaving her husband, I knew that I was going to marry her.\"\n\nAnna and Ben split at the end of 2007, and are officially divorced in 2008.\n\nAnna and Ben Getty Images\n\n2008: Later on in 2008, the couple get engaged, and before they\u2019re even married, they start wearing wedding rings. Chris said, \u201cI just kind of wanted one. She got one and I was like, \u2018I want one!\u2019\u201d\n\n2009: Parks And Recreation's first episode airs, and everyone falls in love with Chris' character Andy.\n\n9th July 2009: The couple tie the knot in a beautiful ceremony in Bali.\n\nMay 2012: Chris and Anna announce that they are expecting their first child.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAugust 2012: They welcome their son Jack.

He says, \u201cFrom his seventh month to his 13th month, I saw him twice. It\u2019s tough. Anna told me his first sentence was \u2018Dada\u2019s working.\u201d\u2019 Pause. \u201cI wonder how old he\u2019s going to be when his sentence is \u2018Dada needs to get a job.\u201d\u2019\n\n2015: Anna opens up for the first time about rumours of Chris\u2019 infidelity. She says, \"I had always kind of believed that part of the rumours of celebrity couples were sort of true because they had never been part of my life. I was like, 'Oh, maybe there's a kernel of truth to that.' It's been a little devastating because for us, it's like, 'What the heck?'\n\n\u201cThis has been blindsiding to us. We have an incredible relationship. It has been weirdly stinging.\u201d\n\n2016: Chris talks about the couple struggling with the jealousy they both feel when the other one films a sex scene.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cWe have an understanding of what we do for a living, and I think that if I was married to somebody who was, like a schoolteacher or a different job, maybe it\u2019d be a little harder for them to comprehend what exactly goes down and the sacrifices you have to make.\"\n\nThe same year, Anna opens up again about how she is affected by rumours that Chris has cheated on her.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel incredibly insecure,' she told Isla Fisher on her own podcast, Anna Faris Is Unqualified. \u201cChris and I, we talk about this a lot. We grapple with a lot of the ideas of being a public couple.\u201d\n\nShe says they were tested about a year ago when \"there were some tabloid rumours about strain in our relationship.\"\n\nShe tried to ignore it, but said, \"I just remember feeling so hurt in a way that bothered me, because I didn't want to think of myself as somebody who could be affected by tabloid shit.\"\n\nWhen Isla asks her what hurt the most and made her feel the most vulnerable, Anna explains that \"it was a combination of things.\n\n\"I take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris, but having said that, of course, in this crazy world where he's off doing movies and I'm in LA. raising our child, of course I'm going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would.\"\n\n19th January 2017: Chris stars alongside Anna in her show Mom.\n\nLet the countdown begin!!!

We watched each other grow, and he still cracks me up all the time. And I think I crack him up\u2014unless he\u2019s a really good actor and great at faking laughter.\"\n\nShe also saw the internet's reaction to the breakup and gets it: \"It\u2019s understandable that people seemed so invested in our happiness together,\" she said. \"All I can say about that is, it\u2019s all true, that we truly adore each other, and we love each other, I think it still comes through.\"\n\n2nd December 2017: Chris officially files for divorce from Anna, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nTMZ reveals that Anna filed her response to the divorce at the same time, with both parents requesting joint custody of their five-year-old son Jack.\n\n\n\nDivorce documents list the date of split as 13th July, nearly a month before the couple publicly announced their split with a statement on 6th August.\n\n18th April 2018: Chris opens up about the couple's divorce for the first time.\n\n\"Divorce sucks,\" Chris told Entertainment Weekly. \"But at the end of the day, we've got a great kid who's got two parents who love him very much.\n\n\n\n\"And we're finding a way to navigate this while still remaining friends and still being kind to one another.
