I\u2019m not buying it,\u201d Rippon said.\n\nAfter reading the story online, Pence\u2019s press secretary quickly shot back, sending USA TODAY SPORTS a rebuttal to Rippon\u2019s comments:\n\n\u201cThe vice president is proud to lead the U.S. delegation to the Olympics and support America\u2019s incredible athletes,\u201d press secretary Alyssa Farah said. \u201cThis accusation is totally false and has no basis in fact. Despite these misinformed claims, the vice president will be enthusiastically supporting all the U.S. athletes competing next month in Pyeongchang.\u201d\n\nBut that was not the end of it. Pence apparently was so concerned about Rippon\u2019s comments that he then set in motion the attempt to speak with him. Farah did not reply to an email earlier this week seeking comment, but after the story was published, Jarrod Agen, Pence's deputy chief of staff and communications director, issued a statement.\n\n\"The vice president\u2019s office did not reach out to set up a conversation with Mr. Rippon. As we\u2019ve said before, the Vice President is supporting all the U.S. athletes in the Olympics and is hoping they all win medals.\"\n\nOn Jan. 30, nearly two weeks after the dust-up, Rippon said that he was focusing solely on training for the upcoming Olympics. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to pick a fight with the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nRippon has said several times that he would consider meeting with Pence sometime later.\n\n\u201cIf I had the chance to meet him afterwards, after I\u2019m finished competing, there might be a possibility to have an open conversation,\u201d Rippon said in the interview last month. \u201cHe seems more mild-mannered than Donald Trump. \u2026 But I don\u2019t think the current administration represents the values that I was taught growing up. Mike Pence doesn\u2019t stand for anything that I really believe in.\u201d\n\nThe comments from Rippon about gay conversion therapy that so riled Pence come from a widespread belief stemming from a statement Pence made in 2000 on his congressional campaign website: \u201cResources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\u201d\n\nWhile Pence didn\u2019t explicitly mention gay conversion therapy, leaders in the LGBT community have said they believe that\u2019s exactly what Pence meant in light of his long-standing opposition to gay rights. In November 2016, the New York Times reported that Pence's spokesman at the time, Marc Lotter, denied that Pence supports the practice.\n\nI emailed Farah on Jan. 17 asking what the website statement was referring to, if not gay conversion therapy. She did not send an on-the-record reply.\n\nRippon, 28, the 2016 U.S. men\u2019s figure skating champion who is one of the first openly gay U.S. Winter Olympians, was selected to his first Olympic team in early January after finishing fourth at the U.S. national championships.\n\nHe said he would prefer not to meet Pence during the traditional meet-and-greet between the official delegation and U.S. athletes in the hours leading to the opening ceremony. It\u2019s possible Rippon will have to miss that event anyway to be part of the team figure skating competition.\n\n\u201cIf it were before my event, I would absolutely not go out of my way to meet somebody who I felt has gone out of their way to not only show that they aren\u2019t a friend of a gay person but that they think that they\u2019re sick,\u201d Rippon said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to meet somebody like that.\"\n\nRippon, who said he was bullied and teased as a boy growing up in Scranton, Pa., came out publicly as being gay in an October 2015 story in Skating magazine. He often talks about how he hopes his story can help others, especially young people who might be struggling with their sexuality.\n\nAlways outspoken, Rippon said recently he will not go to the White House for a post-Olympic celebration hosted by President Trump: \u201cI said no.\u201d Legendary skier Lindsey Vonn has also said she will not attend.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5721613879001_5721609726001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e2cf45ea44560d1d11ee93f75600ba33d6160cc/c=0-564-1992-1690/local/-/media/2018/02/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636535621827839316-cxx-Adam-Rippon-18.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/190a6e9e3803d396bb5deb5b90b55836331323f7/c=35-271-1925-2791/local/-/media/2018/02/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636535621827839316-cxx-Adam-Rippon-18.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e2cf45ea44560d1d11ee93f75600ba33d6160cc/c=0-564-1992-1690/local/-/media/2018/02/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636535621827839316-cxx-Adam-Rippon-18.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2018/02/07/2018-winter-olympics-vice-president-mike-pence-adam-rippon-south-korea-gay-rights/314167002/", "title": "Openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined chance to speak with Vice President Pence", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined chance to speak with Vice President Pence", "description": "Pence\u2019s staff requested the conversation with the openly gay Rippon after reading the skater\u2019s derogatory remarks about him in a USA TODAY Sports.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2018/02/07/2018-winter-olympics-vice-president-mike-pence-adam-rippon-south-korea-gay-rights/314167002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e2cf45ea44560d1d11ee93f75600ba33d6160cc/c=0-564-1992-1690/local/-/media/2018/02/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636535621827839316-cxx-Adam-Rippon-18.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1992, "height": 1126}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Christine Brennan", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Pence\u2019s staff requested the conversation with the openly gay Rippon after reading the skater\u2019s derogatory remarks about him in a USA TODAY Sports.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e2cf45ea44560d1d11ee93f75600ba33d6160cc/c=0-564-1992-1690/local/-/media/2018/02/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636535621827839316-cxx-Adam-Rippon-18.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Openly gay figure skater Adam Rippon declined chance to speak with Vice President Pence", "description": "Pence\u2019s staff requested the conversation with the openly gay Rippon after reading the skater\u2019s derogatory remarks about him in a USA TODAY Sports."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517932800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
