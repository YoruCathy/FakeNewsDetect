Much like The Room itself, these conversations spiraled in many directions \u2014 enough, it turns out, to create an entire oral history of the project. (Unlike The Room, no one mentioned breast cancer.) Below, director/star James Franco, and actors Dave Franco, Ari Graynor, and Josh Hutcherson discuss how they brought the story behind the 21st century\u2019s biggest cult film to life, while the real Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero also pop in to give their thoughts. If you don\u2019t like it, leave your stupid comments in your pocket.\n\nInspiration\n\nIn which James Franco decides to become Tommy Wiseau.\n\nJames Franco (Tommy Wiseau/Johnny): I had not seen The Room before deciding to make The Disaster Artist, which is crazy. I lived in L.A. when The Room came out and I saw the very strange, slightly scary billboard with Tommy\u2019s phone number on it, but I had no idea what it was. I drove by it all the time and I must\u2019ve thought it was like \u2026 in L.A. we have this woman named Angelyne, this blonde woman that drives around in a pink Corvette. She had some billboards that said, \u201cAngelyne\u201d and there was a phone number. I think I might\u2019ve thought it was like that. Like, If you want Angelyne, the woman who drives the Barbie car in your movie, call that number, and if you want this scary-looking guy with long black hair and a lazy eyelid in your movie, call this number.\n\nThe infamous Room billboard.\n\nJonah Hill and Paul Rudd and Michael Cera and all those people were going to screenings. It was a thing. I never got invited or, I don\u2019t know, it just never penetrated into my consciousness. But then The Disaster Artist came out on The New York Times Book Review and I read the book, and before I was halfway done, I just knew that this was the story for me.\n\nI didn\u2019t write the script and the movie didn\u2019t come fully baked in my brain, but there were a few things I knew right away. I knew that I wanted to direct it. I had to play Tommy Wiseau. My brother would be perfect for Greg. We had the right dynamic for those characters. My brother\u2019s seven years younger than I am. The way I perceived him growing up was this easy-go-lucky kinda guy, had a lot of friends. I was the firstborn and I always felt like I was the brooding one. And then, even more than that, I had done a lot of what my brother considers strange things, made weird choices artistically.\n\nMy brother and I hadn\u2019t done that much together as actors, but we had done this series of short videos for Funny or Die where I played this wacky acting teacher who gave him ridiculous, inane advice. That was on my mind when I was reading the book. That\u2019s sort of the seed of the dynamic between Tommy and Greg.\n\nDave Franco (Greg Sestero/Mark): In both cases I am looking at him like he\u2019s a crazy person. It worked out pretty well.\n\nJF: I also knew that it had to be the story of an artist. Not a project that spoofed Tommy. We had to treat him like we would any other artist. Whether he intended The Room to be a comedy or not, it doesn\u2019t really matter. The thing is made. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s this undeniably magical, fascinating, multi-layered thing that people have been watching for 14 years. It\u2019s got something. I came around to really regard him as some sort of strange outsider artist.\n\nTommy Wiseau: One thing I noticed from the beginning, what James did \u2014 his craft, his approach \u2014 is not a parody. He approaches it in a respectful way.\n\nJF: With Tommy, I really think underneath everything, he wanted two things, and they overlap: He wanted to express himself as an artist, and he wanted a family. He wanted friends. He wanted acceptance. That drive to make a movie, be an artist and have a family, in a strange way, is sort of parallel to James Dean. When James Dean was young, his mom died and his father sent him away to live with his aunt and uncle. Hollywood movies were the things he thought would bring him the love that would fill that hole.\n\nMaking The Room was an incredibly meaningful endeavor for Tommy. It was gonna save his life. I think Tommy was really depressed before he wrote The Room, and you can see him channeling all of that rejection and betrayal into The Room. This all-American guy Johnny, the guy that Tommy\u2019s trying to be all his life, is betrayed by his best friend and his girlfriend, then he commits suicide. Tommy was expressing all the rejection that he felt his whole life and then instead of committing suicide in real life, he channeled it into his movie! That\u2019s the definition of an artist!\n\nPreparation\n\nFranco begins to assemble the cast. His brother Dave comes onboard to play Sestero, while Josh Hutcherson and Ari Graynor sign on to play The Room\u2019s other stars.\n\nJames Franco in The Disaster Artist. Photo: Justina Mintz/A24\n\nJosh Hutcherson (Philip Haldiman/Denny): My biggest trepidation before doing the movie was, I had zero desire to make fun of anybody. I\u2019m not into bullying, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool. These people, this whole crew and cast, they set out to make a movie. It\u2019s a very hard endeavor, and they did it.\n\nDF: I wanted to talk to Greg as much as possible. I was very curious about whether, during the production of The Room, Greg ever believed that The Room could be a good movie. He claims that he did not ever think that The Room had a chance at being of quality. But I don\u2019t fully believe him. When you\u2019re a young actor, getting onto a movie set is the most exciting thing in the world. Whatever you\u2019re working on, you almost have to believe that it could be good. I have been on movie sets where everyone involved is hyping the movie to the point that they were talking about potential awards. And then the movie would come out, and not only was it not good, it was a piece of shit.\n\nJF: There were two people I considered for the Juliette Danielle role. The other person I considered for a second was Britney Spears, because Juliette the actress sorta has a Britney Spears thing going on. Britney\u2019s a great performer, but I knew that Ari Graynor was such a solid actress.\n\nAri Graynor (Juliette Danielle/Lisa): I got a text from James Franco that said, \u201cHey, this is James Franco.\u201d I had a new phone and I thought it was a joke. He said, \u201cWatch The Room, I want you to play Lisa.\u201d I watched The Room alone in my apartment, which is 1,000 percent not the way you want to watch The Room for the first time. But my jaw was on the floor. I instantly felt like it would be the greatest honor of my career to play Lisa.\n\nFranco, too, had to figure out how to embody Tommy Wiseau.\n\nJF: For Tommy\u2019s voice, basically I did exactly what I did with James Dean. I would drive around in my car and listen to interviews or the audio of his movies. I had something even better with Tommy because Tommy used to record every single phone conversation he ever had. Like in The Room, that\u2019s based on what Tommy actually did! And not only would he record phone conversations, he would drive around in his car talking to himself and record it. Greg had taken some of these tapes and digitized them, and he gave me those recordings. Tommy knows now; it\u2019s not completely unethical. I have Tommy 20 years ago, before The Room, driving around Los Angeles talking about his acting classes. Even then he had the seeds of making his own movie. [In Tommy voice] \u201cNobody understand me. The teacher don\u2019t understand me. I think he intimidated by my power.\u201d I remember one of his recordings being like, \u201cMaybe I just do my own movie or maybe I do rock and roll album. I don\u2019t know, one or the other.\u201d It was such an amazing glimpse into his private thoughts.\n\nProduction\n\nThe cast and crew begin the task of painstakingly re-creating all of The Room\u2019s idiosyncrasies.\n\nSeth Rogen and James Franco in \u201cBound 3.\u201d Photo: Seth Rogan and James Franco\n\nJF: I had a sense that re-creating scenes from The Room would be a part of our movie, obviously. Around the time I was reading the book, Seth Rogen and I had done a shot-for-shot re-creation of Kanye\u2019s \u201cBound 2\u201d video with Kim Kardashian on the set of The Interview. And we learned, when you\u2019re doing that, you look at each shot and the DP lights it as it was, and the costume designer will make sure that looks right, and then the actors just watch, and get all the movements down, and practice it almost like a dance or a song. That was our dry run.\n\nTommy gave Chris Spellman, the production designer, the blueprints for the set. He built them exactly to the blueprint. He matched all the bad sets and the props and the picture frames in the back. Our DP Brandon Trost spent as much time re-creating the bad lighting in The Room as he did doing his good lighting for the rest of the movie. There\u2019s a lot of weird shit, like shadows all over the fuckin\u2019 place. I remember Brandon obsessing over some horrible shadow from a lamp in the middle of the frame, or a shadow going across the actor\u2019s face. He was baffled. Like, How would you even get it that bad?\n\nGreg Sestero: I went one of the times they re-created The Room set. I got to go back and sit inside the room. It was an out-of-body experience. I couldn\u2019t speak for about ten minutes.\n\nJF: Brenda Abbandandolo, the costume designer, went out and tried to match all the things exactly, the right flowered dress and all that stuff. She did an incredible job, not only in the Room costumes, but also creating this insane wardrobe for me to wear as Tommy in the scenes outside The Room. It would take me 20 or 30 minutes just to get dressed because of all the belts. It was like four belts or five belts a day and they were all connected by different straps. It was a whole ordeal to just go to the bathroom.\n\nEarly in the process, Tommy was still sort of skeptical of the whole thing. He offered to loan us like, a door, a lamp, or a chair from the original set, but it would cost like three grand for each item. There was something about that idea that sounded great \u2014 like, you know, some sort of spiritual connection to the original set. But it was highway robbery. And we had the blueprints, so \u2026\n\nGreg Sestero\u2019s beard, a plot point in both The Room and The Disaster Artist, was an area of particular focus.\n\nDF: I have difficulty growing a full beard, which is unfortunate. I spent two and a half months growing out my beard in an effort to make it as real as possible. Unfortunately, I can only grow a strong goatee. We shot the film completely out of order, so at a certain point they had to shave the goatee, and we had to go full, full fake beard. I would not put a fake beard on my worst enemies. You\u2019re literally putting glue on your face. It was extremely uncomfortable and I hope I never have to do it ever again.\n\nGS: I have no idea why I grew the beard. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever done it. I\u2019m sorry that I had to make Dave go through that.\n\nJames Franco on the set of The Disaster Artist. Photo: Justina Mintz/A24\n\nBesides nailing the look of the movie, the actors labored intensely to mirror the performances.\n\nJF: We were doing the words like we were singing a song. We had this song of the dialogue as the original people had said it and we would try to sing it like they sang it. Then we had the dance of their movements, so we\u2019d choreograph our movements like they did it. How do we get this song and dance down as closely to the original as we can? It was really a matter of watching. You\u2019re looking for every little twitch of the mouth, if the hand was cocked at a certain angle. We\u2019d have these iPads with the scenes and watch them over and over again together.\n\nDF: We really tried to match it beat for beat, even down to the details of what angles their heads were turning. Every physical movement, every angle, every breath, every pause. We did our best.\n\nGS: It\u2019s unfair how good of a job they did. It\u2019s so dead-on, it\u2019s scary.\n\nSome scenes took more effort than others.\n\nJF: One of the reasons that I was drawn to Tommy is that his heroes were my heroes! We had different exteriors, we had different life paths, but underneath there\u2019s some weird similarities. I played James Dean and I just love the connection that happened when I knew I was gonna do the \u201cYou\u2019re tearing me apart, Lisa!\u201d scene. Tommy was inspired by James Dean, I had played James Dean, and now I\u2019m playing Tommy. It was like this weird triangulation of influences, each one of us trying to play the other, level upon level.\n\nAG: The first thing I shot for The Disaster Artist was the \u201cthree\u2019s a crowd\u201d scene with Denny and Lisa. And so there I am in that red dress with James and Josh, and Josh is in that ridiculous mushroom wig and the three of us are in this bed on the set of The Room that is exactly like the real set, having the world\u2019s most uncomfortable pillow fight. There is no way to describe how quiet that room feels when you\u2019re doing it, how totally bizarre it is. There\u2019s so many pauses. You only realize how many weird pauses there are in that movie when you start doing it.\n\nJH: I remember I wanted to nail the apple bite correctly. When Denny is downstairs, he turns and then takes a bite while looking up. The specificity of that moment, I really wanted to get that right. There\u2019s a certain pacing: He walks over, steps on the mark awkwardly, looks up awkwardly, takes a bite, a few chews, and then without really having a decision of moving, he walks out of frame. It\u2019s very strange when they say \u201ccut\u201d and you know you did a bad job acting.\n\nDF: It\u2019s funny bouncing back and forth between Greg and Mark. When I\u2019m playing Greg, I\u2019m hoping it comes across very natural and real. When I\u2019m playing Mark, I\u2019m supposed to be acting poorly. But I didn\u2019t want to overdo it, because Greg was an actor who I\u2019m sure was really giving it his best.\n\nJames Franco and Ari Graynor in The Disaster Artist. Photo: Justina Mintz/Courtesy of A24\n\nIn The Disaster Artist, production on the movie\u2019s infamous sex scene occurs during a tense moment in production, just as in real life.\n\nJF: We realized it would be even more powerful if we showed how Tommy and Greg\u2019s personal lives had an influence on the making of the movie. So in our film right before he goes into the scene where he\u2019s directing the love scene and walking around set in nothing but a cock sock \u2014 which I was told he did \u2014 Tommy and Greg have a rift in their relationship. Suddenly it becomes about more than Tommy trying to direct the best sex scene possible. It becomes about his anger. It\u2019s potentially really tricky material, you know? On any movie that I\u2019ve been on, that behavior just would not fly. That was the hardest scene to score. You couldn\u2019t go comedic \u2019cause it would just make it silly, and we couldn\u2019t go creepy beyond redemption. But I think it works in the context of the movie. There\u2019s so many levels happening at once: It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s disturbing, it\u2019s a guy having a breakdown, it\u2019s the first break with the crew \u2014 and it\u2019s all because he\u2019s losing his best friend, Greg!\n\nAG: It\u2019s easy to stay present when James Franco is running around with a Tommy voice and that hair and only a cock sock. You are pretty in the moment.\n\nJF: I had learned a lot on The Deuce about how to portray the shooting of gratuitous sex scenes. The scene could be a critique of a guy being completely inappropriate while directing a sex scene, but that we ourselves would not be inappropriate in any way while making it. Tommy might have thought he needed his butt to sell his movie but we don\u2019t need breasts to sell our movie.\n\nAG: What\u2019s hilarious about remaking any of the scenes of The Room is that every beat of it goes against your instincts. It\u2019s like a kind of jazz you\u2019ve never heard before. When you try to do them, it\u2019s so deliciously uncomfortable because you\u2019re doing things in ways that feel totally unnatural. In the sex scene, it was really trying to be as meticulous about the details as possible: \u201cMove the hand slightly more like this and the finger looks more like this on the back.\u201d It was like a bizarre kind of surgery \u2014 really silly surgery.\n\nJF: The cast that was playing the actors in The Room and re-creating the scenes with me, they were so into it. There is nothing like re-creating bad acting but doing it with the same amount of dedication and meticulousness that you would use for good acting. It\u2019s almost like an excuse to play. And Ari just got it. Having her and Jackie Weaver and Josh Hutcherson as bad actors gives those renditions an extra bit of electricity. They\u2019re doing it almost exactly, but there\u2019s a little more pathos or something underneath. It\u2019s like getting Brando to go do a kid\u2019s birthday party. You\u2019ve got too much talent being funneled into something that is just like a smaller container than the talent. The talent is overflowing out of the container.\n\nRe-creating the movie\u2019s football-in-tuxedos scene was a particular pleasure.\n\nTW: [Why are they wearing tuxedos?] Good question, but at the same time it\u2019s a lousy question. Sorry, I won\u2019t indulge you.\n\nJF: It feels like this weird, kind of innocent thing. Tommy wants to be this kind of all-American guy that plays all-American sports with his buddies, but that\u2019s not his history really. That\u2019s not really his roots. It\u2019s sort of this creation.\n\nJH: That was something I was excited to do because it\u2019s such an iconic scene. The throwing of the football was so awkward and weird and they were really close to each other, physically.\n\nDF: None of us could keep a straight face.\n\nJH: Fortunately, they weren\u2019t, like, throwing 20-yard bombs, or doing anything that was actually like good football-throwing.\n\nDF: Greg actually has pretty good form when it comes to throwing a football so it wasn\u2019t too hard for me to match. As opposed to my brother, who was trying to match Tommy\u2019s extremely awkward football-throwing form.\n\nTW: Johnny or Tommy does not throw the football the way he threw the football. It should be much more manhood, you know what I\u2019m saying?\n\nGS: I\u2019ll give Tommy credit: He can actually throw a decent spiral now. When I first met him, it was a little bit rough. I think he forgets.\n\nThe filmmakers were so impressed by the job they\u2019d done that they added a montage over the credits, where scenes from The Room play alongside their re-creations. The effect is uncanny.\n\nJF: It was sort of a tricky thing to figure out which Room scenes to include. Originally we were strictly going to use them for the premiere scene at the end of our movie. But because we were so happy with our work, we were like, We should flaunt how well we did this and put it in the credits! And that\u2019s a whole story. In the original contract, Tommy\u2019s main stipulation was that, in addition to being paid for his life rights, he would have a scene in the movie. He kept insisting that he have a scene opposite me.\n\nIn the initial cut we watched Tommy\u2019s scene and we were like, There\u2019s no way that scene\u2019s gonna go in the movie. But then, when we realized we wanted to do the side-by-side because we were so happy with our re-creations, we had to renegotiate with Tommy because we hadn\u2019t negotiated for footage from The Room. During that renegotiation he had asked somebody, \u201cHow my scene in the movie?\u201d and they told him it\u2019s not in there. So to get The Room footage for the side-by-sides, we had to put the scene back in. At first, we were like, Oh man. What are we gonna do? And then we realized, Oh, we can put Tommy\u2019s scene at the end of the credits like a Marvel tag. It worked out perfectly.\n\nReception\n\nWiseau premiered his film at a two-week, Oscar-qualifying run at two theaters in Los Angeles. Franco\u2019s premiered at South by Southwest, an experience that was no less nerve-racking.\n\nDave Franco and James Franco in The Disaster Artist. Photo: Justina Mintz/A24\n\nJF: We offered to show Tommy the movie. He didn\u2019t wanna watch it until we premiered it in front of an audience as South by Southwest. We were nervous. Fortunately it was the best screening of my life. We kept looking out over at Tommy down the row to gauge his reactions. He wasn\u2019t really laughing. He was kinda whispering to Greg every once in a while; I learned later he was saying to Greg, \u201cDid that happen? That really happened?\u201d\n\nTW: I remember The Room like I did yesterday. If you talk to Greg, he will tell you the same thing.\n\nJF: Afterwards I asked him, \u201cWhat do you think, Tommy? And he was like, \u201cI approve. 99.9 percent.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the .1 percent?\u201d He goes, \u201cI think you should look at the lighting in the beginning of your film, a little bit off.\u201d I told that story to a couple outlets and he must have read it, because by the time TIFF came around he\u2019s like, \u201cYou know that story you tell, I never say the lighting.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cTommy, come on! I didn\u2019t make that up.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI disagree. I never say that.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, what\u2019s the .1 percent? And he said, \u201cThe way you throw a football, that not how I throw football.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cBecause you\u2019re an all-American boy, you were raised throwing a football and you know how to throw it.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, exactly.\u201d So \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\n\nTW: Overall he did a good job. I\u2019m not here to criticize him. I don\u2019t want to praise him.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d7d/7f7/37ef5ad3e9a03923b749a4f58688034126-29-bound-3.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd0/be8/bd5b864721d33c38bede0727864b919502-21-disaster-artist-oral-history-feature.w1600.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/21/21-disaster-artist-oral-history-feature.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cc2/c22/b901b0694266043071ee9c1c20063189f2-27-disaster-artist-lede.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0eb/fcb/83d052dcb3293cd3ca75d0d2b593f3086a-29-the-room-billboard.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f94/272/3c95c87c29ebd642c08092ed027b6335e0-29-the-disaster-artist-bts.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f5a/601/f53aeca21ad3bd2569fe952eab1162f50c-27-francos-the-disaster-artist.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4f7/39f/741f59fc43badf600eda378e5619213989-29-the-disaster-artist-bts-2.rhorizontal.w710.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/21/21-disaster-artist-oral-history-feature.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-disaster-artist-an-oral-history.html", "title": "\u2018The Disaster Artist:\u2019 An Oral History", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Disaster Artist: An Oral History", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-disaster-artist-an-oral-history.html", "description": "How James Franco and friends brought the story behind the 21st century\u2019s biggest cult film to life.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/21/21-disaster-artist-oral-history-feature.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Disaster Artist: An Oral History", "description": "How James Franco and friends brought the story behind the 21st century\u2019s biggest cult film to life.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/21/21-disaster-artist-oral-history-feature.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-01T09:00:02.726-05:00", "tag": "oral history, oral histories, the room, the disaster artist, movies, james franco, tommy wiseau, dave franco, josh hutcherson, ari graynor, greg sestero, vulture homepage lede", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "How James Franco and friends turned the story behind \u201cThe Room,\u201d the 21st-century\u2019s biggest cult film, to life.", "sailthru.tags": "oral history, oral histories, the room, the disaster artist, movies, james franco, tommy wiseau, dave franco, josh hutcherson, ari graynor, greg sestero, vulture homepage lede", "author": "Nate Jones", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512136802.726, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
