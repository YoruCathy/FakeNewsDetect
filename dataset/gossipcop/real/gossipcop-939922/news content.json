She retweeted fans who portrayed her as the victim of a liberal media double standard. All told, she posted more than 100 times.\n\nLater in the day, President Trump joined her on Twitter. His first public reaction to the show's cancellation was a tweet criticizing Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nRelated: Trump breaks silence on Roseanne Barr scandal\n\nTrump and Barr have been prominent supporters of each other. They both delight in attacking Democrats.\n\nIn this case, Barr was fired for her Tuesday tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett. But she kept it up on Wednesday, retweeting photos of Jarrett side by side with an ape.\n\nIt was Barr's earlier tweet about Jarrett that caused outrage and ultimately led to the show's cancellation. In a response to a comment about Jarrett, Barr had said: \"Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\"\n\nBarr still claims she was just joking when she compared Jarrett to \"Planet of the Apes\" and the Muslim Brotherhood in a tweet on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn a reply to one of her fans, she said \"I honestly thought she was Jewish and Persian-ignorant of me for sure, but...i did.\"\n\nShe also said she had been on Ambien, a medication used to treat insomnia, at the time.\n\nShe tweeted, \"guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting -- it was memorial day too -- i went 2 far & do not want it defended -- it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please.\"\n\nShe cited Ambien again in a later tweet, saying, \"Not giving excuses for what I did(tweeted) but I've done weird stuff while on ambien -- cracked eggs on the wall at 2am etc.\"\n\nOddly, she later deleted all of her references to the medication. Nevertheless, Ambien became the #1 trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday morning, leading to Sanofi's public rebuke. Barr's explanation was deemed laughable.\n\n\"I have only taken Ambien once ... but I don't remember one of the side-effects being racism,\" CNN's John Berman tweeted.\n\nRelated: The inside story of how ABC fired Roseanne Barr\n\nIn one of her other deleted tweets, Barr said \"I'm sorry 4 my tweet, AND I will also defend myself as well as talk to my followers. so, go away if u don't like it. I will handle my sadness the way I want to. I'm tired of being attacked & belittled more than other comedians who have said worse.\"\n\nSome of her replies to fans clearly expressed how she feels. At one point she said she believes she was fired because of fears over a potential boycott of the show's advertisers. She also lashed out at co-stars Michael Fishman and Sara Gilbert.\n\n\"You throw me under the bus. nice!\" she said in a tweet directed at Fishman.\n\nHer Twitter account had a manic feel throughout the morning. Through her selection of retweets, Barr implied that she was fired over her support for President Trump. One of the posts she shared said, inexplicably, \"they brought the show back so they could inevitably cancel the show when she said something they didn't like.\"\n\nBut then she deleted her retweet of that post.\n\nAnother retweet, still up as of 7 a.m. ET, quoted Herman Cain on Fox saying \"I believe they were looking for a reason to cancel #Roseanne and here's why. Even though the show was a ratings success, forces within ABC didn't like the fact that her conservative defense of certain things was so popular.\"\n\ni honestly thought she was Jewish and Persian-ignorant of me for sure, but...i did. \u2014 Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\nBarr also continued to tweet about George Soros, a liberal donor who has been painted as the villain in many right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nOne message she re-tweeted on Wednesday falsely accused the Hungary-born Jewish billionaire of collaborating with the Nazis.\n\nBarr also said her firing \"worked out\" because she \"would leave when they started to try to censor me.\"\n\ni think i know what really happened. It has made me mad, but as I told u-i would leave when they started to try to censor me, so it all worked out \u2014 Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\nAfter a head-spinning 24 hours, there are several outstanding questions:\n\n-- What will ABC schedule Tuesdays at 8 p.m. this fall in place of \"Roseanne?\"\n\n-- Is there any possibility of a \"Roseanne\" sitcom without Barr? A way to keep the cast and crew together in some way?\n\n-- Will there be any measurable backlash from her fans?\n\n-- Will President Trump comment at all?\n\n-- What will Barr do next?\n\nTom Werner, her longtime producing partner, told Deadline.com that he supported ABC's decision.\n\nHe said he hoped \"Roseanne seeks the help she so clearly needs.\"", "images": ["https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnn.svg", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180529193640-roseanne-barr-780x439.jpg", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180529153443-abc-cancels-roseanne-after-stars-racist-twitter-rant-1024x576.jpeg", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/newsletters/reliable_sources/rs-with-button_large1x1.jpg", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif", "https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnnbusiness.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif"], "top_img": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180529193640-roseanne-barr-780x439.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Stelter", "Ivana Kottasov\u00e1"], "canonical_link": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/30/media/roseanne-barr-tweets/index.html", "title": "Roseanne Barr blames Ambien: 'I'm not a racist, just an idiot'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140", "date": "2018-05-30 06:38:06", "title": "Roseanne Barr blames Ambien: 'I'm not a racist, just an idiot'", "description": "The sitcom star unleashed a stream of messages in the early hours of Wednesday after ABC canceled \"Roseanne\" over her racist tweet.", "author": "Brian Stelter and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1", "section": "media", "og": {"title": "Roseanne Barr blames Ambien: 'I'm not a racist, just an idiot'", "type": "article", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/30/media/roseanne-barr-tweets/index.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180529193640-roseanne-barr-780x439.jpg", "width": 780, "height": 439}, "site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "The sitcom star unleashed a stream of messages in the early hours of Wednesday after ABC canceled \"Roseanne\" over her racist tweet."}, "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNMoney", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/30/media/roseanne-barr-tweets/index.html", "title": "Roseanne Barr blames Ambien: 'I'm not a racist, just an idiot'", "description": "The sitcom star unleashed a stream of messages in the early hours of Wednesday after ABC canceled \"Roseanne\" over her racist tweet.", "image": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180529193640-roseanne-barr-540x304.jpg"}, "DC.date.issued": "2018-05-30T06:38:06"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527609600.0, "source": "https://money.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
