Both the wound and the underbelly are skillfully dissected in USA Network\u2019s Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., which debuts February 27, and the results are truly drop-the-mic for what maybe one of the best new shows of the year so far, as I say in my video review above.\n\nWeaving together the tale of the two legendary rappers \u2014 played note-perfect by Marcc Rose and Wavvy Jonez \u2014 with LAPD investigations of the case over the decades, the 10-part limited series created and written by Kyle Long and mainly directed by Anthony Hemingway is a big swing in a new direction for USA, the home of Suits and last year\u2019s The Sinner.\n\nWith strong performances from Westworld\u2019s Jimmi Simpson as a detective trying to get to the bottom of what really went down when Tupac was shot in Las Vegas in 1996 and Biggie was gunned down in Los Angeles in 1997, and Josh Duhamel as a task force cop in the same pursuit, Unsolved puts the needle down on all the right grooves. It\u2019s an accomplishment unto itself for a tale you may already know how it ends (or doesn\u2019t end), and even more so when you see how Long and Hemingway use the cold case as a Trojan horse to break into a way bigger picture.\n\nAmong various cultural rising tides, true crime and hip hop took hold of the collective conscious in the early 1990s and have only increased their influence since. Which is why it is kind of amazing, despite all the other projects on the big and small screen, it has taken so long for the era of Peak TV to definitively take on the defining generational moments that the deaths of Tupac and Biggie were. To really give a big up to Unsolved is the fact that even if Tupac and Biggie mean nothing to you, or how well you might or might not know the real players, the series reveals its subversive hand and never fails to deliver the goods as real life blends with myth and myth-making to create a whole new POV \u2014 or two.\n\nIn that vein, look out for brawny turns by Bokeem Woodbine as the LAPD partner to Duhamel\u2019s Detective Greg Kading; The Wire alum Wendell Pierce; the always compelling Aisha Hinds as Biggie\u2019s relentless mother, who took the LAPD to task; and Underground vet Amirah Vann as an FBI agent on the case.\n\nClick on my video review above to see more of my mix on Unsolved, and get ready for it to get heavy next Tuesday.
