Her blockbuster \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d which has grossed a staggering $821 million worldwide since it opened in the summer, has become a rallying call for women everywhere and a beacon of empowerment in a Donald Trump-led world. Beyond all the Instagram posts of little girls decked out in \u201cWW\u201d regalia while seeing the film and an endorsement from Hillary Clinton, Jenkins recently cracked another glass ceiling. She\u2019ll be directing \u201cWonder Woman 2\u201d for a reported $7 million to $9 million, a record salary for a female filmmaker.\n\nAs she negotiated the terms of her contract with Warner Bros. over several months, Jenkins was conscious of what earning a big paycheck would mean. \u201cYou\u2019re of course aware of the money,\u201d says Jenkins on a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been more aware of a duty than I was in this deal. I was extremely aware that I had to make sure I was being paid what the male equivalent would be.\u201d\n\nArt Streiber for Variety\n\nAccording to recent studies, women only earn roughly 80 cents to every dollar that men get. The pay gap is evident in all corners of society, even Hollywood, where A-list actresses such as Jennifer Lawrence and Charlize Theron have had to fight to be compensated the same as their male peers. But until now, there\u2019s never been an A-list female director with as much clout as Jenkins. Other women behind big live-action tentpoles, such as Catherine Hardwicke (\u201cTwilight\u201d) and Sam Taylor-Johnson (\u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d), didn\u2019t return for second installments, and the studios quickly replaced them with male directors.\n\n\u201cWomen who have not been in a system that allows them to build up the same level of pay as men are not able to be paid the same as men forever if that\u2019s the way it continues,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cYou have to ask for it to happen, and you have to ask when you\u2019re the appropriate person.\u201d She points to Theron, who starred in her 2003 independent film \u201cMonster\u201d and won an Oscar for the role. \u201cI knew when Charlize had to do it on \u2018Snow White and the Huntsman,\u2019 and I felt that it was my job to do it here.\u201d\n\nGal Gadot, the star of \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d was cheering Jenkins on. \u201cShe is definitely paving the way for so many other female directors,\u201d Gadot says. \u201cI think it was very important that she fought to get the best deal. You got to walk the walk and talk the talk.\u201d\n\nDespite the results of the presidential election and women\u2019s marches throughout the country, Jenkins never imagined that \u201cWonder Woman\u201d would touch such a nerve. \u201cI didn\u2019t really start to make the connection about the lightning rod it was going to hit until it had opened,\u201d says Jenkins, who gets stopped by strangers who profess how much the movie has meant to them. \u201cI assumed that it would be seen just as a superhero film.\u201d She\u2019s in awe of all the high-profile groupies that she\u2019s collected along the way. \u201cWhen you hear about people like Hillary Clinton or Dwayne Johnson talking about you in the press, it\u2019s like, \u2018What!\u2019 It\u2019s so crazy and lovely.\u201d\n\nPatty Jenkins and Gal Gadot share a moment on the set of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Warner Bros/Clay Enos\n\nAs Wonder Woman has resurfaced as a cultural icon, Jenkins has been the brains behind the movement. \u201cI\u2019ve become more well-known than I ever thought I would,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be getting this much attention.\u201d Acting as an ambassador for the disenfranchised is a responsibility that Jenkins doesn\u2019t take lightly. \u201cI think the legacy of \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 is a different kind of hero, one that hits the same marks but also really is about love and empowerment in a slightly different way,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I love that people wear her outfit. People who are struggling in some sort of way or don\u2019t identify with the world they live in can often find themselves in Wonder Woman.\u201d\n\nAlthough some critics have read \u201cWonder Woman\u201d as a feminist manifesto \u2014 when our hero meets her love interest, Steve (Chris Pine), she keeps her clothes on, while he\u2019s naked \u2014 Jenkins didn\u2019t think about it in those terms. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is the success of feminism. I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where you\u2019re so feminist, you\u2019re not thinking about it at all. Where you\u2019re like, \u2018Of course this superhero is the greatest superhero of all time. Oh, she\u2019s a woman? I wasn\u2019t even thinking about that!\u2019\u201d\n\nNot everybody has been a fan of \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d After James Cameron publicly bashed the movie with a misogynistic shrug, Jenkins shot back with her own statement on social media. \u201cI actually was not upset at all,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cEverybody is entitled to their own opinion. But if you\u2019re going to debate something in a public way, I have to reply that I think it\u2019s incorrect.\u201d Did Cameron ever reach out to apologize? \u201cNo,\u201d she says.\n\nJenkins worked in Hollywood as a focus puller and a camera operator in her 20s. She was among the small group of women doing a man\u2019s job, but she wasn\u2019t so aware of it. \u201cI never thought about the fact that I was the only woman,\u201d she says. Even so, she thinks it\u2019s important to mentor other women as they try to climb the industry ladder. \u201cI definitely do,\u201d says Jenkins. \u201cBut also, I feel a real obligation to be open to help everyone. I really think that \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 is a loving character to all.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about why 14 years elapsed between her first film and \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d Jenkins says that it was mostly her decision, because she wanted to be at home at night with her son and her husband. And it\u2019s not as if she wasn\u2019t working. She took on TV projects like directing the pilot of \u201cThe Killing.\u201d \u201cWhen you have a little baby, directing a feature where you\u2019re gone every few years is not the easiest thing to sync up,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI know people who have done it. It wasn\u2019t something I chose to do.\u201d\n\nI have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where you\u2019re so feminist, you\u2019re not thinking about it at all.\u201d\n\nPATTY JENKINS\n\nAll the speculation about her career is understandable. The industry still has a dismal record when hiring women directors in the movies: Only 7% of the top 250 films of 2016 were directed by women, and that number gets smaller when you look at blockbusters. Next spring, Disney will release Ava DuVernay\u2019s adaptation of \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d which has a budget north of $100 million. But the list of directors attached to the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise is all-male, even with a female producer (Kathleen Kennedy) in charge. \u201cIt would depend on the project,\u201d Jenkins says when asked if she\u2019d want to direct a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie.\n\nIn the Oscars race, not a single woman director has been nominated since Kathryn Bigelow became the first to win in the category in 2010. Warner Bros. is campaigning Jenkins as part of a robust Oscar push for \u201cWonder Woman\u201d \u2014 if she\u2019s nominated, she\u2019ll be the first director of a comic-book movie to be recognized. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t be considered,\u201d she says of the Academy embracing comic-book adaptations. At least there\u2019s been some progress: This is the first time in recent memory that there\u2019s more than one woman \u2014 including Dee Rees (\u201cMudbound\u201d) and Greta Gerwig (\u201cLady Bird\u201d) \u2014 with a real chance of being nominated for best director.\n\nJenkins was able to negotiate her groundbreaking deal with Warner Bros. because the studio didn\u2019t lock her down to multiple chapters. She had been in talks for \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d but the studio offered the job to another filmmaker. After Michelle MacLaren exited due to creative differences, Jenkins signed on, without committing to a sequel. \u201cThey could have tied me up earlier,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d Even though she wasn\u2019t on board for a second movie, she kept envisioning it while making the first. (She\u2019s been working on a treatment with DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns.) \u201cI think she has a really clear and fun and compelling place that she\u2019s taking the story,\u201d says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chief Toby Emmerich.\n\nJenkins directs a scene in the 2003 film \u201cMonster.\u201d Charlize Theron, who played serial killer Aileen Wuornos, won an Oscar for the lead role.\n\nSnap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOne of the mantras associated with Wonder Woman \u2014 \u201cLife is tough but so am I\u201d \u2014 could easily apply to Jenkins\u2019 own upbringing. Her father, William T. Jenkins, was an Air Force captain. He fought in Vietnam and later ran maneuvers out of a military base in England; his family joined him on all his adventures overseas. In interviews, Jenkins has talked a lot about how the heroism of her dad shaped \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d She even has a dedication to him in the film\u2019s closing credits.\n\nBut what she doesn\u2019t talk about much is that he died, at 31, when she was only 7. \u201cHe passed away after taking off from a runway exactly like the one that Steve takes off on,\u201d Jenkins says, referring to Wonder Woman\u2019s boyfriend. \u201cHe crashed in the ocean.\u201d She\u2019s still not sure exactly what happened. \u201cNobody knows. He was in the middle of a NATO mock dogfight. They crash a lot. You\u2019re doing a tricky maneuver.\u201d\n\nHer father\u2019s spirit was on the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d set, even if she didn\u2019t always reference him directly. Gadot says she thought of Jenkins\u2019 dad when she saw the film for the first time, especially during the climactic scene where Steve makes the ultimate sacrifice for the woman he loves. \u201cI think that even in the short time that he was present in her life, he had a lot of effect on who she became,\u201d Gadot says.\n\nThe death of her father framed Jenkins\u2019 outlook in many ways. \u201cIt\u2019s part of why I think I wanted to make movies,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to experience wonder somewhere. I didn\u2019t think I would experience it in real life.\u201d\n\nA few months after her dad passed away, Jenkins remembers a cross-country road trip from Kansas to San Francisco in a VW bug. \u201cMy mom\u201d \u2014 who would put herself through school to become an environmental scientist \u2014 \u201cdropped my sister and I at the movie theater to wait out this snowstorm,\u201d Jenkins says. They watched the original \u201cSuperman,\u201d starring Christopher Reeve. \u201cI remember everything about the experience of seeing it,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt really hit me in that way of exactly what I think superheroes were designed to do \u2014 to inspire you to metaphorically imagine the superhero within.\u201d\n\nThat movie gave a grieving young girl some hope. It also provided her with a clear goal. \u201cSeriously, that\u2019s the part I can\u2019t believe,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI always thought, because of \u2018Superman,\u2019 one day I want to make a movie that makes other people feel like that movie made me feel. The fact that that\u2019s come true is so stunning.\u201d\n\nWatch a behind-the-scenes video of Jenkins\u2019 Power of Women L.A. cover shoot.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/patty-jenkins-bts-monster-2003.jpg", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ffilm%2Ffeatures%2Fpatty-jenkins-wonder-woman-hollywood-sexism-equal-pay-james-cameron-1202583237%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202583237&comment_count=25", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/patty-jenkins-power-of-women-variety.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wonder-woman-bts.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/patty-jenkins-power-of-women-variety.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ramin Setoodeh"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/features/patty-jenkins-wonder-woman-hollywood-sexism-equal-pay-james-cameron-1202583237/", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Director Patty Jenkins on Equal Pay, Hollywood Sexism and James Cameron\u2019s Nasty Words", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "How the director of \"Wonder Woman' became a beacon of inspiration in an industry dominated by men.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202583237, "author": "Ramin Setoodeh", "pmc-category": "Features,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-10-10T06:00:14"}, "pmc-tag": "Patty Jenkins,Power Of Women,Wonder Woman", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Director Patty Jenkins on Equal Pay, Hollywood Sexism and James Cameron\u2019s Nasty Words", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film", "pmc-primary-category": "Features", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Director Patty Jenkins on Equal Pay, Hollywood Sexism and James Cameron\u2019s Nasty Words", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/features/patty-jenkins-wonder-woman-hollywood-sexism-equal-pay-james-cameron-1202583237/", "description": "Much like a certain Amazon goddess with a lasso, there are no heights that director Patty Jenkins can\u2019t scale.

At least there\u2019s been some progress: This is the first time in recent memory that there\u2019s more than one woman \u2014 including Dee Rees (\u201cMudbound\u201d) and Greta Gerwig (\u201cLady Bird\u201d) \u2014 with a real chance of being nominated for best director.\r\n\r\nJenkins was able to negotiate her groundbreaking deal with Warner Bros. because the studio didn\u2019t lock her down to multiple chapters. She had been in talks for \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d but the studio offered the job to another filmmaker. After Michelle MacLaren exited due to creative differences, Jenkins signed on, without committing to a sequel. \u201cThey could have tied me up earlier,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d Even though she wasn\u2019t on board for a second movie, she kept envisioning it while making the first. (She\u2019s been working on a treatment with DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns.) \u201cI think she has a really clear and fun and compelling place that she\u2019s taking the story,\u201d says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chief Toby Emmerich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJenkins directs a scene in the 2003 film \u201cMonster.\u201d Charlize Theron, who played serial killer Aileen Wuornos, won an Oscar for the lead role.\r\nSnap Stills/REX/Shutterstock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the mantras associated with Wonder Woman \u2014 \u201cLife is tough but so am I\u201d \u2014 could easily apply to Jenkins\u2019 own upbringing. Her father, William T. Jenkins, was an Air Force captain. He fought in Vietnam and later ran maneuvers out of a military base in England; his family joined him on all his adventures overseas. In interviews, Jenkins has talked a lot about how the heroism of her dad shaped \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d She even has a dedication to him in the film\u2019s closing credits.\r\n\r\nBut what she doesn\u2019t talk about much is that he died, at 31, when she was only 7. \u201cHe passed away after taking off from a runway exactly like the one that Steve takes off on,\u201d Jenkins says, referring to Wonder Woman\u2019s boyfriend. \u201cHe crashed in the ocean.\u201d She\u2019s still not sure exactly what happened. \u201cNobody knows. He was in the middle of a NATO mock dogfight. They crash a lot. You\u2019re doing a tricky maneuver.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer father\u2019s spirit was on the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d set, even if she didn\u2019t always reference him directly. Gadot says she thought of Jenkins\u2019 dad when she saw the film for the first time, especially during the climactic scene where Steve makes the ultimate sacrifice for the woman he loves. \u201cI think that even in the short time that he was present in her life, he had a lot of effect on who she became,\u201d Gadot says.\r\n\r\nThe death of her father framed Jenkins\u2019 outlook in many ways. \u201cIt\u2019s part of why I think I wanted to make movies,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to experience wonder somewhere. I didn\u2019t think I would experience it in real life.\u201d\r\n\r\nA few months after her dad passed away, Jenkins remembers a cross-country road trip from Kansas to San Francisco in a VW bug. \u201cMy mom\u201d \u2014 who would put herself through school to become an environmental scientist \u2014 \u201cdropped my sister and I at the movie theater to wait out this snowstorm,\u201d Jenkins says. They watched the original \u201cSuperman,\u201d starring Christopher Reeve. \u201cI remember everything about the experience of seeing it,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt really hit me in that way of exactly what I think superheroes were designed to do \u2014 to inspire you to metaphorically imagine the superhero within.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat movie gave a grieving young girl some hope. It also provided her with a clear goal. \u201cSeriously, that\u2019s the part I can\u2019t believe,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI always thought, because of \u2018Superman,\u2019 one day I want to make a movie that makes other people feel like that movie made me feel. The fact that that\u2019s come true is so stunning.\u201d\r\n\r\nWatch a behind-the-scenes video of Jenkins\u2019 Power of Women L.A. cover shoot.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTs0Fw2RkdA&feature=youtu.be", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTs0Fw2RkdA?version=3&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://pmcvariety.wordpress.com&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1507640414.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
