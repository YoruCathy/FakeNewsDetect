(The show at the Troxy featured Rupaul\u2019s Drag Race alums Violet Chachki, Kim Chi, Shea Coulee, Shangela, Detox, and Sasha Velor, and was hosted by Drag Race panelist Michelle Visage.)\n\nThe 33-year-old Amazing Spider-Man star was enjoying the show from the audience when he suddenly hopped onstage during a segment called \u201cWig in a Box,\u201d in which he and three other members of the audience were called up to don wigs representing iconic singers and compete in a lip-sync battle. Garfield selected Whitney Houston, while the other three contestants pulled Cher, Dolly Parton, and Katy Perry.\n\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight that the Hollywood stud looked like he was having a blast as he rocked out with the curly brunette wig, dancing and lip-syncing his heart out to the 1992 hit. At one point, Garfield even did a back flip onstage, much to the delight of the audience.\n\nAfter the show, Visage tracked down the actor and shared a photo of herself sandwiched between him and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox.\n\n\u201cAndrew Garfield, you are my new friend, I am SO proud of you for not just lip syncing Whitney tonight in a wig no less, but for opening your mind and heart to all it has to offer,\u201d she captioned the image.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Garfield has dressed in drag, however.
