Tu tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito\" -- which translates to \"You treat me like a princess and give me what I ask. You have the bat and the strength I need,\" teasing her relationship with boyfriend and baseball legend Alex Rodriguez.\n\nAfter sharing the song's cover art on Instagram earlier Thursday, this is the first time J.Lo has released new music since her collaboration on the Skrillex and Poo Bear-produced track \"Us,\" which dropped in February, and it's her first Spanish-language single of the year.\n\nThe performance showcased Lopez's versatile style, with Bohemian-inspired vibes mixed with a touch of urban. She incorporated several dancers and finished off by asking, \"El anillo pa cuando?\" translating to \"When is the ring coming?\"\n\nWatch her performance below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?4863e69cb9d656c61185", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Machin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8390274/jennifer-lopez-el-anillo-billboard-latin-music-awards-performance", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres 'El Anillo' at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-04-27T12:07:08-04:00", "published_time": "2018-04-26T21:20:15-04:00"}, "description": "Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her performance of her never-before-heard song \"El Anillo.\"", "og": {"description": "Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her performance of her never-before-heard song \"El Anillo.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres 'El Anillo' at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8390274/jennifer-lopez-el-anillo-billboard-latin-music-awards-performance", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres 'El Anillo' at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her performance of her never-before-heard song \"El Anillo.\"", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres 'El Anillo' at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524792015.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
