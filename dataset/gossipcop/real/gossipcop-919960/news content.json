You\u2019ve tried special toothpastes, whitening gums, whitening strips, using mouthwash, and even brushing with baking soda every now and again. With the exception of taking a trip down to your dentist\u2019s office and demanding a pricey whitening treatment, you\u2019ve basically tried it all. Everything except turmeric.\n\nIn a recent interview with E! News, 29-year-old actress Julianne Hough admitted that turmeric is to thank for her unforgettably white smile.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think it would be the opposite and it\u2019d stain your teeth, but it actually makes them whiter,\u201d she said, \u201cTurmeric is the bomb. Y\u2019all should try it.\u201d\n\nTurmeric is most commonly known as the kitchen spice that gives curry its signature colour, but despite its orange-yellow tint, turmeric is a spice that is valued in and outside of the kitchen in many areas of the world.\n\nHealth-wise, what makes the spice so beneficial is curcumin, a natural antibiotic, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory found in turmeric that helps to repair damage and clear away bacteria. Turmeric also contains natural brightening properties, which in theory makes it the perfect natural teeth whitener and gum cleanser.\n\nTEETH WHITENING: Coconut Oil & Turmeric.

The jury is divided on this one. According to many social media beauty gurus like Farah Dhukai and bloggers like Aliee Chan, it totally does! Though it is worth noting that some doctors like Shereene Idriss, M.D., advise that while turmeric may have the potential of whitening your smile overtime, you could also be at risk of staining your teeth if you don\u2019t rinse your mouth thoroughly enough. And you should be mindful that turmeric does not have the same effect on your sink and toothbrush as it does on your teeth\u2013so proceed on your journey to whiter teeth with caution!\n\nIf you\u2019re apprehensive to the idea of using turmeric as a teeth whitener, you\u2019ll be happy to know that turmeric\u2019s superpowers don\u2019t just stop there. Its lightening properties and fine texture make for a cleansing and exfoliating mask great for targeting dark spots and acne. Turmeric has also been linked to improved brain health, weight loss and more. Does it actually work? Well, at the very least, it won\u2019t hurt your wallet to try.", "images": ["https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/bell_logo.gif", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Facebook_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/icon_close_share.png", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_facebook_aqua.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Julianne-Hough-uses-this-3-spice-to-whiten-her-teeth.jpg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_navigation.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Pinterest_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/CTVLife.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_navigation_on.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_twitter_aqua.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Email_icon.svg", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=00fd23e76b23ff54d34a7b3fd2fd570a3c", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_pinterest_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/ym.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Twitter_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_pinterest_aqua.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/marilyn.svg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6485645&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/sponsors/bell-aliant-logo.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=417766778714379&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_pinterest_Dgrey.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_search_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_twitter_Dgrey.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/WhatsApp_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_facebook_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_twitter_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/logo_desktop.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/thesocial.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Linkedin_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/FR_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_facebook_Dgrey.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_mail.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/etalk.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/logo_horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Julianne-Hough-uses-this-3-spice-to-whiten-her-teeth.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne James", "Brianne James -"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theloop.ca/julianne-hough-uses-3-spice-whiten-teeth", "title": "Julianne Hough uses this $3 spice to whiten her teeth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Goodbye expensive whitening treatments.", "google-site-verification": "SVTb1Z_Uvzk18cAGAhUb6C2qPS-UZH6Zuiei5ZXMr38", "datePublished": "2018-03-13T15:32:53+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 118691728090, "app_id": 384569415349244}, "twitter": {"site": "@theloopca", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Julianne Hough uses this $3 spice to whiten her teeth", "description": "Goodbye expensive whitening treatments."}, "og": {"title": "Julianne Hough uses this $3 spice to whiten her teeth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theloop.ca/julianne-hough-uses-3-spice-whiten-teeth/", "description": "Goodbye expensive whitening treatments.", "site_name": "The Loop", "image": "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Julianne-Hough-uses-this-3-spice-to-whiten-her-teeth.jpg"}, "author": "Brianne James"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.theloop.ca", "summary": ""}
