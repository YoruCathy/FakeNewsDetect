Vianney Le Caer/Associated Press\n\nDon't let the headlines fool you. They may have been \"spotted\" together at one point or another, but Harry never seriously dated the singer Natalie Imbruglia or the actress Emma Watson.\n\nHe was, however, seen with the pop star Ellie Goulding at the 2016 Audi Polo Challenge, with eyewitnesses telling The Telegraph that the two \"spent a lot of time sitting together under blankets.\"\n\nDuring a 2016 interview with \"The Project TV,\" Goulding was asked whether she planned to have a baby with Harry anytime soon. A mortified Goulding said no and called her interviewers out for being \"naughty, naughty people.\"\n\nHarry has also been turned down for dates. Earlier this year, the actress Katie Cassidy told Entertainment Tonight she had randomly met Harry in 2014 while on vacation with friends in Miami.\n\nShe said Harry and his friends, who appeared to be part of a bachelor party, invited Cassidy and her friends out with them. The group of women thanked them for their offer but said no.\n\nCassidy said she saw Harry the next day at the pool, recalling that he was understanding and respectful about the declined offer.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5af32a9e18ad411b008b47af?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5af3290a18ad411c008b47cd?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5af32a0b805e8923008b46b7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5af3283118ad411b008b47a3?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5af32a75a9f88a68028b47a5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-ex-girlfriends-2018-5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5af328806bc6e62e008b47e5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5af3283118ad411b008b47a3?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5af32a9e18ad411b008b47af?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Taylor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-ex-girlfriends-2018-5", "title": "A guide to Prince Harry's ex-girlfriends", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "A guide to Prince Harry's ex-girlfriends", "date": "2018-05-13", "news_keywords": "Features, BI-freelancer, Prince Harry, Royal Wedding, Meghan Markle, Meghan and Harry, BIStrategy, Heather Taylor", "description": "Before Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's highest-profile relationships were with Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas.
