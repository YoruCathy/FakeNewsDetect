Sources say that the move comes after Strahan got upset over the addition of future baseball Hall-Of-Famer Alex Rodriguez as a GMA contributor.\n\n\u201cTell your friends, tell your family, tell the whole town, shout it from the rooftops,\u201d Strahan tweeted. \u201cStarting September 10th @sarahaines and I will be hosting the 3rd hour of @GMA! #gmaday #gma\u201d\n\nStrahan has been a popular part of the morning news show since he left his job as co-host of Live! with Kelly Ripa in 2016. But recently, when the network hired Rodriguez without his input, he was not happy and felt threatened by the move.\n\nWe\u2019re so excited to announce that @michaelstrahan and @sarahaines will be co-hosts of #GMADay \u2013 our new third hour, premiering Sept. 10 at 1pm ET / 12pm C/P! https://t.co/W5KClVZvJP pic.twitter.com/z9GkaM5irv \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) July 23, 2018\n\nInstead of battling Rodriguez for airtime \u2013 or being worried about the former baseball player taking his place \u2013 Strahan made the move to the spinoff, and his future co-host is excited about the new show.\n\nOn Instagram, Haines wrote that she couldn\u2019t find the words to adequately express her excitement about sitting next to Strahan on this new journey. She added that it has been a dream of hers for a long time, but it is bittersweet to leave The View.\n\nGMA Day will premiere on Monday, September 10th, and air at 1 p.m. in the east and noon in the central and pacific time zones. It will be replacing The Chew, which ABC canceled after the sexual misconduct and rape allegations against star chef Mario Batali.\n\nAs for Rodriguez, Good Morning America has been giving him a ton of airtime, and insiders say it feels like he is starting to overshadow the six-foot-five Strahan. The sources add that A-Rod\u2019s goal is to overtake Strahan as television\u2019s \u201ctop jock.\u201d In addition to his gig on GMA, Rodriguez is also the lead MLB analyst for FOX Sports, and he has been a guest judge on Shark Tank.\n\nAfter his steroid scandal in 2014, Rodriguez has been attempting to rebuild his image. He comes across as quite the train wreck compared to the squeaky-clean Strahan. But ABC is willing to take the gamble, and Rodriguez will reportedly climb over anyone to achieve his goal.\n\nHis high-profile relationship with Jennifer Lopez also helps.\n\nInsiders say that both Strahan and Rodriguez have \u201cmassive egos,\u201d and Rodriguez joining GMA has caused Strahan to get jealous.\n\nBut, as Radar Online reports, Strahan is no stranger to how cutthroat TV can be. He shocked Ripa when he told her he was leaving her show for GMA just minutes before they went on the air.\n\nHowever, insiders say that Strahan doesn\u2019t believe Rodriguez deserves another chance, and he can\u2019t believe his image renovation.\n\nIf there is any truth to the rumors that Strahan feels threatened by Rodriguez, though, many fans find it hard to believe. In addition to GMA, Strahan is also the host of the $100,000 Pyramid, and he co-hosts FOXs NFL pregame show during football season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems like we will get multiple opportunities to see both Alex Rodriguez and Michael Strahan on television in the future.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/michelle_williams-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Phaedra-Parks-Sons-Piano-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BeyoncC3A9_16_9_1584091346-300x166.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennier-Lopez-SevenStarsWorld.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Alex-Rodriguez-Is-Reportedly-Gunning-To-Replace-Michael-Strahan-At-GMA.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Michael-Strahans-Sues-For-Custody-Of-Kids-After-Accusing-Ex-Wife-Of-Abuse-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rs_600x600-181115140701-600-p-diddy-somber-me-11518-300x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/media-15-276x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-alex-rodriguez-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Alex-Rodriguez-Is-Reportedly-Gunning-To-Replace-Michael-Strahan-At-GMA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/alex-rodriguez-is-reportedly-gunning-to-replace-michael-strahan-at-gma-173104/", "title": "Alex Rodriguez Is Reportedly Gunning To Replace Michael Strahan At \u2018GMA\u2019", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "alex rodriguez, gma, michael strahan,", "keywords": "celebrity news, alex rodriguez, gma, michael strahan,", "description": "ABC has announced that Michael Strahan is leaving Good Morning America and will team up with The View co-host Sara Haines to host a new third hour of", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Alex Rodriguez Is Reportedly Gunning To Replace Michael Strahan At \u2018GMA\u2019", "description": "ABC has announced that Michael Strahan is leaving Good Morning America and will team up with The View co-host Sara Haines to host a new third hour of", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/alex-rodriguez-is-reportedly-gunning-to-replace-michael-strahan-at-gma-173104/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Alex-Rodriguez-Is-Reportedly-Gunning-To-Replace-Michael-Strahan-At-GMA.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-26", "modified_time": "2018-07-26", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/suzykerr/", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "michael strahan"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532534400.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
