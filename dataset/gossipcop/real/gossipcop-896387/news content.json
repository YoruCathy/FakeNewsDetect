Kelly & Vicki's Nasty Feud Ends In Screaming & Tears At Reunion Dodd said she will quit the show if Gunvalson isn't fired over shocking drug claim.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County reunion part one caused some serious damage \u2014 weeks after it was shot!\n\nAs RadarOnline.com readers know, Vicki Gunvalson and Kelly Dodd\u2018s friendship crumbled at the beginning of season 13, when Vicki, 56, set up Kelly\u2019s ex-husband Michael on a date with one of their mutual girlfriends \u2014 behind Kelly\u2019s back.\n\nPart one started off with Andy Cohen breaking the ice by telling Vicki that he was admiring her new face.\n\nMeanwhile, Shannon Beador dropped the first bombshell by telling Andy, 50, that she\u2019d lost 32 pounds since last season.\n\nAfter Vicki talked about having a life insurance policy on her ex-husband Donn Gunvalson, Tamra Judge said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could do that.\u201d\n\nVicki replied, \u201cWell you have a life insurance out on Eddie.\u201d As Radar previously reported, Eddie Judge recently underwent his fifth heart procedure and it seemed to have been a success!\n\nAndy then asked Shannon, 54, \u201cYou said that Vicki told you this season that Brooks was her soulmate,\u201d referring to her cancer-faking ex, Brooks Ayers. He then asked about Vicki\u2019s current boyfriend, Steve Lodge.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting was Steve trying to keep a lid on her behavior because Steve told her to behave,\u201d said Shannon.\n\nTamra, 51, jumped in, telling the cast that she approved of Steve. But they all voiced how they didn\u2019t like how he controlled her party-girl behavior!\n\nAfter a long discussion on the matter, the entire cast agreed that Steve was overbearing on Vicki, at which point the star herself revealed that couple\u2019s therapy was looking necessary.\n\n\u201cWho thinks that Vicki and Steve are getting married?\u201d asked Andy.\n\nVicki raised her hand, \u201cSeason 14!\u201d she screamed.\n\nThe next topic of conversation was new cast member Gina Kirschenheiter\u2018s mysterious divorce from husband and baby-daddy, Matt Kirschenheiter.\n\n\u201cDid you start the show knowing that your marriage was over,\u201d Andy asked Gina, 34.\n\n\u201cI started the show knowing that Matt and I were in a horrible down. But I didn\u2019t know that down was going to cause me to pull the trigger,\u201d she admitted.\n\n\u201cMatt couldn\u2019t film because he would have lost his job,\u201d Gina said, adding that she had not told their kids yet and that she and Matt stopped having sex.\n\n\u201cI feel bad. No matter what happens, I really want to have a good relationship with him because it is forever,\u201d Gina added, while crying her eyes out.\n\nAndy then went into Kelly Dodd, 43, and Vicki \u2014 who went from friends to mortal enemies.\n\n\u201cIs Michael still dating the woman that you set her up with?\u201d Andy asked Vicki, clearly fueling the fire.\n\n\u201cNo. He is dating someone new. We met her in July. They went to the Huntington Beach Parade and we met her,\u201d Vicki told Andy.\n\nAndy asked a question from a viewer that was on everyone\u2019s minds. \u201cKelly do you have a problem with Michael hanging out with Vicki and Steve?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an issue with Michael hanging out with Vicki and Steve. I was freshly divorced. I didn\u2019t know that she had hooked them up. I had to find out from someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cIf she would have told me I would be fine. It was a girl that we were both friends with. I am not friends with her anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to say anything. They only went on three dates and Michael didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d said Kelly, defending her decision to betray Vicki.\n\nThen came the bombshell of all bombshells! Vicki started the confrontation by calling Kelly a \u201cloud mouth.\u201d\n\nKelly fired back, \u201cBig a** mouth. Turn around and look at yourself in the mirror.\u201d\n\nVicki then dropped the mother bomb, telling Kelly, \u201cI don\u2019t do cocaine!\u201d\n\nKelly responded, \u201cI don\u2019t do cocaine either.\u201d\n\nVicki revealed that Michael was the one who told her that Kelly did cocaine and that he was \u201cmiserable\u201d their entire marriage.\n\nAnd after Bravo leaked the shocking clip last week, Kelly said that if Vicki doesn\u2019t get fired she is going to quit!\n\nThe reunion part one ended with Kelly acting hysterical on the phone with Michael.\n\nTune in to The Real Housewives of Orange County reunion part 2, next Sunday at 9/8 Central only on Bravo!\n\nDo you think that Kelly Dodd will quit?
