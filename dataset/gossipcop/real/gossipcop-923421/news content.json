I cannot have one. I have to have, like, 10. They\u2019re so tiny\u2026. It\u2019s a guilty pleasure.\u201d\n\nKFC CANADA DEBUTS 'WAFFLE DOUBLE DOWN' SANDWICH\n\nThe shocking news seemingly contradicts everything about the former Victoria Secret superstar\u2019s much-buzzed about 80 percent vegetable diet that forbids white sugar, white flour, MSG, caffeine, fungus, and dairy that she follows alongside her husband, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nEven still, the mother of two further divulged that she became a Munchkin enthusiast in the most family-friendly way possible. According to People, B\u00fcndchen was won over after Brady suggested they bring boxes of Munchkins to their 8-year-old son Benjamin\u2019s hockey practice.\n\nWAITER FIRED FOR BEING 'AGGRESSIVE' CLAIMS IT IS HIS FRENCH PERSONALITY\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a thing that we bring it,\u201d she said.\n\nThough it may seem unbelievable that the ultra health-conscious clan actually eats Munchkins, WSJ\u2019s Jason Gay says it must be true.\n\n\u201cReader, I need you to trust my judgment,\u201d he writes in the interview.\n\n\u201cI am a Massachusetts kid \u2014 my bloodstream is still one-third Dunkaccino. And I am here, on a winter morning at the woodsy, snow-covered B\u00fcndchen-Brady home outside Boston, nestled on a couch, looking directly into the blue eyes of one of the world\u2019s most recognizable women, and I believe with all of my heart that she is telling me the truth.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/fox-news-lifestyle_fox-news-lifestyle.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/tiger-cow-2-Jam-Press.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/fashion-nova.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Tunnel2Towers-on-2020-04-15-at-10.21.00_05_58_13.Still001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/gisele-munchkins.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gisele-munchkins.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/blockdown-photo-504027.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gisele-munchkins.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
