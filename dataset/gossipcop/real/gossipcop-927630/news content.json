The stunning gown, designed by Sandi Spika, caused quite a stir when she first wore it because of its revealing sheer neckline.\n\n\"Sandi Spika made it in 1993. I wore it to sing 'Does He Love You' with Linda Davis 25 years ago,\" McEntire told ET's Nancy O'Dell backstage. \"I didn\u2019t tell Sandi I was going to bring it back and wear it tonight. I saw her reaction, I saw her in the audience, she was crying.\"\n\n\"It fit, really pleased,\" she added.\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nFollowing the awards ceremony, Clarkson, who is married to McEntire's former stepson, Brandon Blackstock, couldn\u2019t help but gush about her mother-in-law.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" Clarkson told ET about their performance. \"I was telling my husband, my team that's with me today, no matter how long I've known her, no matter that we're even family now, it's still that 10-year-old kid [that] gets giddy,\" Clarkson expressed. \"And especially, she came out in that dress. The red dress, I was like, 'Oh, OK.' Rocking that dress, I can't.\"\n\nFor more on McEntire and her throwback fashions, watch below.\n\nWatch Reba McEntire Hilariously React to Her Throwback Fashions!
