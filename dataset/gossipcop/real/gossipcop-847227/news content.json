Otherwise, hold on to your crimson bedsheets: it\u2019s about to get explicitly spoilery in here. Don\u2019t say Czernobog didn\u2019t warn you.\n\nPartway through the first episode of American Gods, creators Bryan Fuller and Michael Green let audiences know exactly __what to expect, sexual content-wise, from Starz\u2019s latest foray into the world of fantasy prestige TV. Putting the much-ballyhooed sexual gymnastics of Westeros to shame, American Gods presents a feast for the eyes in the shape of Yetide Badaki\u2019s goddess character, Bilquis, devouring her helpless, worshipful sexual partner in the midst of their first assignation. And, no, she doesn\u2019t use her mouth to do it. That scene is even crazier in the book by Neil Gaiman, but Fuller and Green pulled out all manner of technical trickery to make it play so well on TV.\n\nThe scene comes early enough in the season to signal viewers what they might expect in the future of American Gods. (This certainly isn\u2019t the last artfully shot, jaw-dropping sexual encounter of Season 1.) But the Bilquis scene comes even earlier in the book\u2014before the end of the first chapter, in fact. Instead of being a poor, duped victim of Internet dating gone awry, as he is on the show, Bilquis\u2019s victim in the book is a crude \u201cJohn\u201d\u2014and she, in the parlance of the novel, is a \u201chooker.\u201d You have much less sympathy for the book victim when she gulps him down.\n\nAlmost everything else goes similarly in both novel and show. Bilquis asks to be worshipped; her partner obliges, and chants phrases that no John (or poor Internet Dater) could possibly know. And then:", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59067d7c4654fa68050e36bf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ag-spoiler-czernobog.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bd896df8260a3f190f2c0f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/american-gods-first-look-orlando-jones.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59022a71a9f28a122a3c28c3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-04-28-ashley.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c427210a144505fae9ea0e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/american-gods-episode-1-review.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59022a6b2efecd23d0f29d79/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-04-28-jennifer.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56aa5153e4cf2b8d14c3880e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ricky-whittle-american-gods.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59022a752efecd23d0f29d7d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-04-28-gigi.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57930c76ce6d3bca38637541/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bilquis.gif"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/american-gods-sex-scene-bilquis-special-effects-book-yetide-badaki", "title": "That Insane American Gods Sex Scene Is Even Crazier in the Book", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Plus how TV series pulled it all off.", "id": "59067b3616b60656d95fa9d3", "keywords": "television,american gods", "news_keywords": "television,american gods", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59067b3616b60656d95fa9d3", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Plus how TV series pulled it all off.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Plus how TV series pulled it all off.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "That Insane American Gods Sex Scene Is Even Crazier in the Book", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/american-gods-sex-scene-bilquis-special-effects-book-yetide-badaki"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Plus how TV series pulled it all off.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57891fab814b54392dde94e3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-bilquis-starz-vf.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "That Insane American Gods Sex Scene Is Even Crazier in the Book"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
