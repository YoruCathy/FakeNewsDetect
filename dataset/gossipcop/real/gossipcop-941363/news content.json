For ABC, this is a big win. In 2013, Sean Lowe was nicknamed the \u201cVirgin Bachelor\u201d after the tabloids reported he was a \u201cborn again virgin,\u201d although the show itself avoided the topic. So can you imagine how excited the producers are for a \u201cBachelor\u201d star who will actually talk about it? (\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I took pride in on both seasons, is just being true to where I am,\u201d Colton told Michael Strahan on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Tuesday.) The potential story lines are endless.\n\nAD\n\nABC executive Robert Mills made the Sean comparison in a recent E! interview, saying that Colton \u201ccertainly has a lot of the attributes that you love in a Bachelor. There\u2019s a little bit of that Sean Lowe . . . he\u2019s also a guy who is surprisingly funny and charismatic. Colton could be a very interesting Bachelor.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, plenty of viewers feel otherwise. Last week, blogger Reality Steve leaked the news early. \u201cI\u2019m hearing that they will be announcing the next \u2018Bachelor\u2019 soon and it will be Colton,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMy thoughts are Sean Lowe has been their only successful Bachelor. They must feel Colton is the closest thing they\u2019ll get to Sean. Character, morals, no shady past, etc. Sean 2.0. Here we go. Let the freaking out begin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSure enough, the responses poured in, and they were almost uniformly negative. The most common reaction was that while Colton may be a nice guy, he\u2019s extremely boring \u2014 a deadly ingredient in any reality show. Many clamored for a more charming, interesting and mature choice, such as his fellow runners-up Blake Horstmann, Jason Tartick or Wills Reid. Or even fan favorite Joe Amabile, known as Grocery Store Joe.\n\nOthers scoffed about how Colton bounced from \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d (where he appeared heartbroken when Becca broke up with him) to \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d (where he had an emotional on-and-off relationship with Tia) to \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d with remarkable speed. Raven Gates, Tia\u2019s best friend and former \u201cBachelor\u201d contestant, appeared on \u201cParadise\u201d to warn her pal that Colton may not be there for the right reasons \u2014 and that perhaps he was only interested in dating \u201cIt Girls.\u201d (Before \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise, Colton dated Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman.)\n\nSome felt that his casting cheapens the already questionable premise of the show. \u201cEven if we\u2019re being generous and calling Colton\u2019s brief time with Becca and Tia \u2018relationships,\u2019 we\u2019re still dealing with an anxious, 26-year-old virgin whose dating history does not indicate he\u2019s ready to put a ring on it,\u201d wrote Entertainment Weekly TV critic Kristen Baldwin, a longtime \u201cBachelor\u201d recapper. \u201cWhat about that says \u2018perfect Bachelor material\u2019 to anyone?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmid the outrage, creator Mike Fleiss issued a vague tweet over the weekend: \u201cYou all know what the Bible says about passing judgment on others\u2026 It\u2019s against it. #TheBachelor.\u201d\n\n\u201c1) the Bible has nothing to do with The Bachelor. 2) simply not wanting bachelor Colton isn\u2019t a sin,\u201d one fan tweeted in reply. \u201c3) maybe you should actually listen to who the fans want for once, we\u2019re the reason the show\u2019s still running & without us you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nOf course, the producers care about only one thing: drama. Colton has already had plenty of it. During \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d this summer, he told Becca that he and Tia had briefly dated a few months earlier. (He contacted her after seeing her on \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d) This was awkward for Becca, given that Tia was one of her closest friends when they competed on Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Later, Tia made a guest appearance to confess to Becca that she still had feelings for Colton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat, combined with Colton\u2019s virgin revelation (although Becca was more concerned with the fact that he had only been in one serious relationship), basically sealed his fate. Even though Colton told Becca he was falling in love with her, she sent him home after he made the final four. A couple of weeks later, Colton had a heated confrontation on the \u201cMen Tell All\u201d episode when another contestant mocked his virginity.\n\nThen, on \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d last month, Colton and Tia both joined as cast members and hooked up again; their coupling was a big story line. Alas, on Monday, Colton took Tia aside and confessed that he really wanted things to work, but his feelings just weren\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cYou deserve somebody who\u2019s going to be crazy about you every single day,\u201d Colton said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut can you honestly say that you, like, tried?\u201d Tia asked tearfully.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI could look at you with 100 percent certainty and say that I tried here. I gave it my all,\u201d Colton responded gravely. Tia broke down in sobs.\n\nImmediately, viewers started speculating about the authenticity of Colton and Tia\u2019s breakup, as it was conveniently timed to be just before the \u201cBachelor\u201d announcement the next morning.\n\nThey came to Colton and said: Your puppy-loving charity-running, Twitter-posting self has met the minimum qualifications to be the Bachelor. Dramatically break things off with Tia, but cry REALLY hard so we can use it as the intro to the next season. #BachelorInParadise pic.twitter.com/HAWwd8PTzh \u2014 Emily Ann\u2698 (@IamEmily_Ann) September 4, 2018\n\n\u201cI know Colton is a great guy.\" The #BachelorInParadise editors are even making brokenhearted Tia endorse Colton for Bachelor. \u2014 Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) September 4, 2018\n\nColton last week when he didn't know if he booked the bachelor gig: I'm ready to date tia.\n\nColton this week when he found out he booked the bachelor gig: nvm #BachelorInParadise \u2014 Bachelor Fanatic (@bachfanatic93) September 4, 2018\n\nThe Tia/Colton storyline \u2014 the early Bachelorette group date awkwardness, Tia's post-hometowns revelation, the silly #BachelorInParadise back-and-forth, tonight's breakup and apparently beyond \u2014 may go down as the most embarrassing, contrived, and misguided in the show's history. \u2014 Rosecast Pod (@RosecastES) September 4, 2018\n\nHowever, with his new \u201cBachelor\u201d gig official, Colton insisted that his former \u201cBachelor\u201d relationships are in the past.\n\n\u201cObviously you can tell how it was all so emotional for me,\u201d Colton told People magazine. \u201cBut it was also good for me. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Becca and enough good things about Tia. They\u2019ve helped me grow and discover who I am and what I\u2019m looking for in a wife.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VUwZk8VtHP9aE2d_HONLNvK6kIs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTGI3X4LQU3O7J2KH4EV4HVZBY.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTGI3X4LQU3O7J2KH4EV4HVZBY.jpg&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VUwZk8VtHP9aE2d_HONLNvK6kIs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTGI3X4LQU3O7J2KH4EV4HVZBY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2018/09/04/colton-underwood-is-the-new-bachelor-heres-why-some-viewers-arent-happy/", "title": "Colton Underwood is the new \u2018Bachelor.\u2019 Here\u2019s why some viewers aren\u2019t happy.", "meta_data": {"description": "Colton, the former football player whose main story line is that he\u2019s a 26-year-old virgin, wasn\u2019t the first choice for many fans.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2018/09/04/colton-underwood-is-the-new-bachelor-heres-why-some-viewers-arent-happy/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VUwZk8VtHP9aE2d_HONLNvK6kIs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTGI3X4LQU3O7J2KH4EV4HVZBY.jpg", "title": "Colton Underwood is the new \u2018Bachelor.\u2019 Here\u2019s why some viewers aren\u2019t happy.", "description": "Colton, the former football player whose main story line is that he\u2019s a 26-year-old virgin, wasn\u2019t the first choice for many fans."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Colton Underwood is the new \u2018Bachelor.\u2019 Here\u2019s why some viewers aren\u2019t happy.", "description": "Colton, the former football player whose main story line is that he\u2019s a 26-year-old virgin, wasn\u2019t the first choice for many fans."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-03-31T17:12:57.667Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535990400.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
