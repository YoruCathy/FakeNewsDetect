The Fifth Harmony singer has improved week after week, but the fierce schedule and routines have definitely taken their toll on her body. Previously, Kordei opened up about the strain on her back, which was affecting her movements. Chmerkovskiy told DWTS viewers that injuries at this point in the competition are completely normal, so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\nUnfortunately, Kordei has suffered another injury and this time, it\u2019s a twisted ankle. In a clip from the show, Kordei talked about last week\u2019s live episode, saying:\n\nLast week we had one of our most challenging dances. The judges saw a stumble \u2026 it just shows anything can set me back. Any little thing can be the reason why I don\u2019t get the mirrorball.\n\nKordei stresses that any little error can definitely impact your performance. In addition, E! reports that when it comes to her ankle injury, she says that:\n\nAll of my body weight came down on it really hard and it just \u2026\n\nPartner Chmerkovskiy then chimed in that:\n\nThis couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time. I just feel terrible. This is a week that\u2019s already really intense and she\u2019s never going to admit that she\u2019s hurt.\n\nDespite her injury, Kordei says she can \u201cpush through anything.\u201d She said she knows her injury looked bad, but that she\u2019s doing better. We\u2019ll just have to see how Kordei does in her finale performances tonight. For her Redemption routine, she and Chmerkovskiy are dancing a Quickstep, which could definitely hurt a twisted ankle. They are doing this routine to \u201cCheck It Out\u2019 by Oh the Larceny. In addition, Kordei is performing a Freestyle dance to \u201cWhat the World Needs Now is Love\u201d by Andra Day.\n\nBe sure to cast your votes if you hope to see Kordei win this season. Tonight\u2019s part 1 of the finale airs from 8 \u2013 9 p.m. ET/PT time delay and tomorrow night\u2019s grand finale runs from 8:30 \u2013 11 p.m. ET/PT time delay on the ABC network.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20567959cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/146689_dsc_68651.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d892c01bf62335cf957945b053c2d52d?s=71&d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D71&r=PG", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/fifth-harmony-5.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=lfktn1QolK10vg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/146689_dsc_68651.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780&h=520", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/amber-rose-5.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/146689_dsc_68651.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Weigle"], "canonical_link": "https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/05/normani-kordei-dancing-with-the-stars-will-her-twisted-ankle-injury-dwts-injured-val-chmerkovskiy/", "title": "Normani Kordei, Dancing With the Stars: Will Twisted Ankle Injury Affect DWTS", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "nfPVut3DNEWv3BaV0stQ8yOV3TeBg_TWFdQzQYaG8Qs", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 360, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#121212", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Will Normani Kordei's twisted ankly injury affect her performances on the finale episodes of \"Dancing With the Stars\"?
