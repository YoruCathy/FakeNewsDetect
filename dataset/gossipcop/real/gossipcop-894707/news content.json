The word's actual meaning is supposed to be 'nice', 'fresh', 'desirable,' or 'cool'.

Later in the movie, she repeated it after their performance in Winter Talent Show, putting off Regina.\n\nModern Day\n\nThe slang became extremely popular with the Mean Girls' fandom and to this day, after 14 years as of 2018, people all over the world are still trying to make 'fetch' a real thing.\n\nAlong with 'You go, Glen Coco!', 'fetch' is by far the most memorable term from the franchise.\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201c Regina: [referring to Cady's bracelet] I love it!\n\nGretchen: So Fetch!\n\nRegina: What is fetch?\n\nGretchen: Oh, it's like slang, from...
