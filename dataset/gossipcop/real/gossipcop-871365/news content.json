Another shelter is at Grant Park South, located at 325 South Michigan Avenue between East Jackson Boulevard and East Van Buren. Another shelter is at the Millennium Lakeside garage located at 5 South Columbus Drive, between East Monroe and East Randolph streets.There are signs to direct people to these locations. Safety officials will be available to give directions.More than 170 performers will hit eight stages at this year's four-day music fest. Wiz Kalifa, Lorde, Muse and Cage the Elephant were a few of Thursday's headliners.

But, you know, it falls to pieces and you really see whoever sounds good,\" said Blake Shreves, who arrived early for the music festival.\"The storms? Actually, I look forward to the storms. All the dirt on the inside turns into a mudslide. It's one big party. Love it,\" said Gavin Humfleet, who also arrived early for Lolla.Parking will be available, but public transportation is probably the best to get to Grant Park. Lollapalooza organizers arranged shuttles from several different suburban locations.
