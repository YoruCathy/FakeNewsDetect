We want to reiterate that Derick\u2019s personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cTLC is proud to share the story of Jazz jennings and her family and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nThe decision from the network comes after Dillard spoke for a second time about Jennings, arguing that he doesn\u2019t believe that one can change their gender identity and refused to use feminine pronouns when discussing Jennings.\n\n\u201cI pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It\u2019s sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what\u2019s on tv these days,\u201d he wrote in response to another commenter who brought up his older comments about Jennings.\n\nAs previously reported, Dillard, who came to fame alongside his wife Jill Duggar on TLC, previously took issue with Jennings saying that gender is \u201cordained by God.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an oxymoron\u2026 a 'reality' show which follows a non-reality. 'Transgender' is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it\u2019s ordained by God.\u201d\n\nJennings, who hasn\u2019t directly responded to Dillard\u2019s latest comments, said at the time:\n\n\u201cEvery day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different.\u201d\n\nDillard continued to respond to his latest statements, saying that he\u2019s just trying to have a mature discussion about his concerns as a Christian. He also speculated as to the capability of a child to make decisions about their gender identity. However, people on Twitter were mostly unimpressed with his justification, and it was enough to prompt the network to completely sever ties with him.", "images":
