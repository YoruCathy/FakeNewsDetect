There\u2019s a power dynamic that feels impossible to overcome \u2014 James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames) October 12, 2017\n\nWhat Weinstein is being accused of is criminal. What he\u2019s admitted to is unacceptable - in any industry. I applaud everybody speaking out. \u2014 James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames) October 12, 2017\n\n\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star Terry Crews shared a similar story on Tuesday, recounting when a \u201chigh level\u201d executive \u201cgroped my privates.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t speak out at the time for fear of losing job opportunities.\n\n\u201c240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho\u201d would be the headline the next day. (5/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nThe actors\u2019 allegations follow damning reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker detailing decades of Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct. More than a dozen women have come forward, including three who have accused him of rape. The now-disgraced Hollywood titan has received widespread condemnation, including from former President Barack Obama. On Sunday, Weinstein was fired from his namesake company.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59df1b8120000009340865fe.jpeg?cache=zev9fiq0qu&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ddd477140000a6234942ee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563a070f1800001700303c63.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59df1b8120000009340865fe.jpeg?cache=zev9fiq0qu&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-van-der-beek-sexual-harassment_n_59df1a83e4b0eb18af063d84", "title": "James Van Der Beek Reveals He's Been Sexually Harassed By 'Older, Powerful Men'", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I've had them corner me in inappropriate sexual conversations,\" he tweeted.", "keywords": "U.S. News,Celebrities,Sex Crimes,harvey weinstein,James Van Der Beek", "og": {"title": "James Van Der Beek Reveals He's Been Sexually Harassed By 'Older, Powerful Men'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59df1b8120000009340865fe.jpeg?cache=zev9fiq0qu&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59df1b8120000009340865fe.jpeg?cache=zev9fiq0qu&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/james-van-der-beek-sexual-harassment_n_59df1a83e4b0eb18af063d84", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"I've had them corner me in inappropriate sexual conversations,\" he tweeted."}, "article": {"tag": "U.S. News,Celebrities,Sex Crimes,harvey weinstein,James Van Der Beek", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/willa.frej", "published_time": "2017-10-12 04:19:44 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-10-12 15:51:49 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "James Van Der Beek Reveals He's Been Sexually Harassed By 'Older, Powerful Men'", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59df1b8120000009340865fe.jpeg?cache=zev9fiq0qu&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"I've had them corner me in inappropriate sexual conversations,\" he tweeted.", "creator": "willafrej"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59df1a83e4b0eb18af063d84", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507796384.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
