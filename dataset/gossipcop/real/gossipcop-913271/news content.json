CBS, which won the demo last year, slipped to third place but remained on top in total viewers (9.7 million) for the ninth straight season.\n\nIn addition to two NFL packages (Sunday Night Football and Thursday Night Football) and The Voice, NBC got additional help this year from This Is Us, the breakout freshman hit that finished as the season\u2019s No. 2 broadcast entertainment series in the 18-49 demo.\n\nFox jumped up a spot to second place in the demo (1.9) on the strength of the Super Bowl, which drew 111.3 million viewers, and its seven-game World Series, in which the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Game 7 win over the Cleveland Indians was the most-watched World Series game in 25 years.\n\nCBS, last year\u2019s demo king, may have slipped, but at last week\u2019s upfront event, CEO Leslie Moonves\u2014who on Monday extended his CBS deal through 2021\u2014told buyers \u201cthat old idea of just one coveted demo is so dated. You know, like American Idol.\u201d Of course, a year earlier, he was all too eager to tout CBS\u2019 win in the demo (along with total viewers).\n\nABC was again in fourth place in the demo (1.6) and hopes its upcoming American Idol revival, which its broadcast competitors spent all of upfront week taking shots at, will keep it from a three-peat next season. The CW followed with a 0.7 demo rating.\n\nNBC was second in total viewers with 8.1 million, followed by ABC (6.2 million), Fox (5.8 million) and The CW (1.8 million).\n\n\u201cIt feels really great to win a season with no added help,\u201d NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt told Adweek earlier this month. \u201cWe love having sports in our schedule, and we have some of the best franchises in the world. But when you take sports out of the equation, we\u2019re still the No. 1 network with just entertainment programming, which wasn\u2019t the case a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\nThis is the first season in 13 years that NBC won the season in the demo in entertainment programs only (excluding sports and news) since Friends and Frasier ended in the 2003-04 season.\n\nAnd with both the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics locked in for February, Greenblatt said, \u201cNext season is kind of in the bag, I hate to say, given the heft of the sporting events.\u201d\n\nThe year\u2019s most-watched broadcast series in both total viewers and the 18-49 demo was NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football, with 20.1 million total viewers and a 6.9 demo rating. The No. 1 comedy in the demo was The Big Bang Theory (4.9), and the No. 1 drama was This Is Us (4.6).\n\nHowever, AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead once again bested all broadcast shows with an 8.0 rating in the demo this season.\n\nThe most-watched comedy in total viewers was The Big Bang Theory (18.5 million viewers), while NCIS led all dramas with 18.3 million viewers.\n\n(All ratings reflect Nielsen\u2019s \u201cmost current\u201d ratings, which is live-plus-7 for the entire season except for the last two weeks, which are live-plus-same-day.)\n\nDespite NBC and Fox\u2019s demo gains this year, both networks were flat compared with last season. CBS fell 22 percent in the demo without the Super Bowl, ABC dropped 11 percent and The CW was down 13 percent.", "images":
