I apologize to everyone who planned to travel to Las Vegas to see my show. I know how disappointing this is, and I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nThe announcement said concerts scheduled from March 27 to April 18 at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace have been canceled. It goes on to offer details for ticket refunds.\n\nThe concerts will resume as scheduled on May 22.\n\nThe Facebook announcement goes on to explain the reason: \"C\u00e9line has been dealing with a condition in her middle ear known as Patulous Eustachian tube, which causes hearing irregularities, and makes it extremely difficult to sing.\"\n\nAccording to the message, the singer has been experiencing the condition for more than a year. Ear drop medications that had successfully treated the condition stopped working recently, leading to the surgery decision.\n\nAlthough Dion had to cancel two January shows, she did have a special guest fan at one of her performances: Adele.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3df38dd248282e606e380e13951d4673c2eabf99/c=0-189-3712-2286/local/-/media/2018/03/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636572587535578495-AFP-AFP-QA4XM-92149413.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3df38dd248282e606e380e13951d4673c2eabf99/c=0-189-3712-2286/local/-/media/2018/03/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636572587535578495-AFP-AFP-QA4XM-92149413.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3df38dd248282e606e380e13951d4673c2eabf99/c=0-189-3712-2286/local/-/media/2018/03/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636572587535578495-AFP-AFP-QA4XM-92149413.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/03/21/celine-dion-facing-ear-surgery-cancels-las-vegas-concerts/447812002/", "title": "Celine Dion, facing ear surgery, cancels Las Vegas concerts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Celine Dion, facing ear surgery, cancels Las Vegas concerts", "description": "Superstar Celine Dion tells fans she is canceling Caesars Palace dates to have  a procedure to fix a condition that causes hearing irregularities.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/03/21/celine-dion-facing-ear-surgery-cancels-las-vegas-concerts/447812002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3df38dd248282e606e380e13951d4673c2eabf99/c=0-189-3712-2286/local/-/media/2018/03/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636572587535578495-AFP-AFP-QA4XM-92149413.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bill Keveney", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Superstar Celine Dion tells fans she is canceling Caesars Palace dates to have  a procedure to fix a condition that causes hearing irregularities.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3df38dd248282e606e380e13951d4673c2eabf99/c=0-189-3712-2286/local/-/media/2018/03/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636572587535578495-AFP-AFP-QA4XM-92149413.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Celine Dion, facing ear surgery, cancels Las Vegas concerts", "description": "Superstar Celine Dion tells fans she is canceling Caesars Palace dates to have  a procedure to fix a condition that causes hearing irregularities."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521561600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
