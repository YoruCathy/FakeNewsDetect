It\u2019s just a difficult discussion. I\u2019d rather respectfully not enter it today.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Dylan Farrow \u2013 who is one of the star\u2019s three children with ex Mia Farrow \u2013 publicly claimed that Allen molested her as a child. Allen adamantly denied Dylan\u2019s claims at the time. His son Ronan Farrow also penned an explosive column for the Hollywood Reporter, which addressed the sexual abuse claims and condemned the media for not asking Allen about the allegations and stars for working with him. In response, Allen told The Guardian, \u201cI have no interest in all of that. I find that all tabloid stupidity.\u201d\n\nThe controversy surrounding the director is making headlines again after the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment accusations rocked Hollywood.\n\nImage zoom Jessica Miglio/Amazon Studios\n\nWinslet in Wonder Wheel\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kate Winslet Says Not Thanking Harvey Weinstein for Her Oscar was \u2018Absolutely Deliberate\u2019\n\nWinslet recently garnered controversy of her own when she briefly defended working with the director in an interview for the New York Times. In it, the actress said she ultimately decided to take the role after realizing that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow anything, really, and whether any of it is true or false.\u201d\n\nAsked about the criticism she faced on social media for the interview, Winslet said, \u201cI don\u2019t read how people respond to things. We\u2019re always as actors going to say the wrong thing. I think it\u2019s better to respectfully step away from the discussion.\u201d\n\nWonder Wheel opens today.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-845477624-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkate-winslet-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-845477624-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-845477624-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ale Russian"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/kate-winslet-sidesteps-questions-about-woody-allen-in-new-interview-its-just-a-difficult-discussion/", "title": "Kate Winslet Sidesteps Questions About Woody Allen: 'It\u2019s Just a Difficult Discussion'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kate Winslet,Movie Celebrities,News,Woody Allen", "news_keywords": "Kate Winslet,Movie Celebrities,News,Woody Allen", "description": "The Oscar winner stays\u00a0away from the controversy surrounding Woody Allen in new interview", "og": {"title": "Kate Winslet Sidesteps Questions About Woody Allen: 'It\u2019s Just a Difficult Discussion'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/kate-winslet-sidesteps-questions-about-woody-allen-in-new-interview-its-just-a-difficult-discussion/", "description": "Woody Allen is the one topic Kate Winslet won\u2019t speak out on.
