Although she is the only person to accuse Allen of sexual assault, Farrow draws comparisons with men like producer Harvey Weinstein, who\u2019ve been banished from the industry following allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt is a testament to Allen\u2019s public relations team and his lawyers that few know these simple facts,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cIt also speaks to the forces that have historically protected men like Allen: the money and power deployed to make the simple complicated, to massage the story.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIn this deliberately created fog, A-list actors agree to appear in Allen\u2019s films and journalists tend to avoid the subject.\u201d Winslet has come under fire during her press tour for \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d Allen\u2019s latest film. In a series of increasingly troubling interviews, she praised the director\u2019s ability to \u201cunderstand the female characters he creates\u201d and defended working with him despite the allegations.\n\nDavid McGough via Getty Images Woody Allen and Mia Farrow with children Satchel and Dylan.\n\nDylan Farrow \u2015 one of three children adopted by Allen and actress Mia Farrow \u2015 said Allen sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old. The claim prompted multiple investigations, which determined no abuse had occurred.\n\nFarrow, however, disputes the conclusions in her op-ed, noting a judge\u2019s decision to revoke Allen\u2019s custody of her during a contentious legal battle in 1993.\n\n\u201cIn the final legal disposition of the matter, a judge denied him custody of me, writing that \u2018measures must be taken to protect\u2019 me and that there was \u2018no credible evidence\u2019 that my mother, Mia Farrow, coached me in any way,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cA prosecutor took the unusual step of announcing that he had probable cause to charge Allen but declined in order to spare me, a \u2018child victim,\u2019 from an exhausting trial.\u201d\n\nIn a piece for The New York Times in 2014, Allen emphatically denied Farrow\u2019s version of events, which he says were influenced by his \u201cacrimonious\u201d breakup with Mia Farrow. He cited an expert report to police investigating the claim that declared: \u201cIt is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually abused by Mr. Allen.\u201d\n\nA representative for Allen said in a statement to HuffPost, in response to the op-ed, that Dylan Farrow\u2019s claims were false.\n\n\u201cDylan Farrow\u2019s allegations against Woody Allen, which she first made 25 years ago, have been thoroughly examined by law enforcement officials and child welfare investigators,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe investigators concluded unambiguously that Dylan Farrow was not sexually abused. No charges were ever filed, and the reason is simple: because Woody Allen is innocent.\u201d\n\nGeorge Pimentel via Getty Images Corey Stoll, Blake Lively, Woody Allen, Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg attend a screening of \"Cafe Society\" at the 69th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nDespite Allen\u2019s continued success, Farrow said she\u2019s heartened that actresses like Ellen Page and Jessica Chastain have come forward to either apologize for working with Allen or to pledge never to do so in the future.\n\nShe concluded her op-ed by pointing the finger at those she says are complicit in protecting Allen.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just power that allows men accused of sexual abuse to keep their careers and their secrets,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is also our collective choice to see simple situations as complicated and obvious conclusions as a matter of \u2018who can say\u2019? The system worked for Harvey Weinstein for decades. It works for Woody Allen still.\u201d Read Farrow\u2019s full op-ed in the Los Angeles Times.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32ae1b1600004700c4ffba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2aaf851e000027000c2cdd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ab140190000be35035464.jpeg?cache=lbsjbkeiij&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2aa4111900002500cca2a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc855a6240000090c524d4f.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ab140190000be35035464.jpeg?cache=lbsjbkeiij&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dylan-farrow-kate-winslet-blake-lively-woody-allen_n_5a29baebe4b073789f686c40", "title": "Dylan Farrow Calls Out Blake Lively, Kate Winslet For Working With Woody Allen", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Farrow asks in an op-ed why the #MeToo movement has spared the longtime filmmaker.", "keywords": "Celebrities,Sex Crimes,Music,child abuse,Blake Lively,Woody Allen,Kate Winslet,ronan farrow,mia farrow,Dylan Farrow,MR ALLEN", "og": {"title": "Dylan Farrow Calls Out Blake Lively, Kate Winslet For Working With Woody Allen", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ab140190000be35035464.jpeg?cache=lbsjbkeiij&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ab140190000be35035464.jpeg?cache=lbsjbkeiij&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dylan-farrow-kate-winslet-blake-lively-woody-allen_n_5a29baebe4b073789f686c40", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Farrow asks in an op-ed why the #MeToo movement has spared the longtime filmmaker."}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,Sex Crimes,Music,child abuse,Blake Lively,Woody Allen,Kate Winslet,ronan farrow,mia farrow,Dylan Farrow,MR ALLEN", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-12-08 11:21:25 -0500", "modified_time": "2017-12-08 14:21:38 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Dylan Farrow Calls Out Blake Lively, Kate Winslet For Working With Woody Allen", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ab140190000be35035464.jpeg?cache=lbsjbkeiij&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "Farrow asks in an op-ed why the #MeToo movement has spared the longtime filmmaker.", "creator": "cdelbyck"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a29baebe4b073789f686c40", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512750085.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
