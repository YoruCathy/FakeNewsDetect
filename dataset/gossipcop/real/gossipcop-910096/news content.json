{"url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/reviews/rose-mcgowan-citizen-rose-e-documentary-review-1202680951/", "text": "There\u2019s a moment midway through \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d that encapsulates what the documentary does well.\n\nRose McGowan is getting ready for Thanksgiving at a relative\u2019s house where the dinner party will include many people she\u2019s never met. As she looks in the mirror, she talks about the fact that everyone there will already know a lot about her. She\u2019ll be meeting her brother\u2019s girlfriend for the first time, and though that is exciting to her, she\u2019s nervous too, given that, even at the best of times, Thanksgiving dinners can be fraught.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine being the person whom many families \u2014 not just your own \u2014 were discussing over the holidays. But the Great Reckoning that has begun to wash across the country has made McGowan much more famous than she was before. As this realization hits her \u2014 the certainty that everyone at the gathering will have made assumptions about her \u2014 McGowan closes her eyes and leans on the bathroom sink.\n\nIs she attempting to comfort herself? Is she simply acknowledging the contradictory emotions of the moment? Maybe she\u2019s fashioning some kind of emotional armor. It\u2019s not clear, because the moment isn\u2019t. There\u2019s no precise label for what she\u2019s going through.\n\nAt the dinner, McGowan seems to be in good spirits, but \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d scratches at the edges of that word: \u201cseems.\u201d What did it cost her to interact calmly with family members and strangers, or to give a speech in front of thousands of women, weeks after the identity of her alleged rapist was revealed? After years of private struggle and public dismissal, what was it like to finally watch the world confront the legacy of \u201cthe monster\u201d whom she says assaulted her 20 years ago? What will the industry \u2014 and the world \u2014 do in response to not just her story, but the stories of other men and women who have been assaulted, abused and harassed?\n\nThere\u2019s no easy answer to any of those questions, and being truthful about that is \u201cCitizen Rose\u2019s\u201d primary accomplishment. The two-hour film depicts the kind of complicated messiness that accompanies any story of trauma. There is no ending to the process; the kind of tidy catharsis that Hollywood loves is missing.\n\nIn its first hour, \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d is especially jagged as it bounces around between McGowan\u2019s past and present, but the rawness and even the occasional sense of chaos feels right for this story, which is far from over. McGowan herself is many people in the film: The truth-teller who talks to the camera while sitting fully clothed in her empty bathtub; the organizer who leads a retreat focused on the mission of her \u201cRose Army\u201d; the friend who just wants her pal, Amber Tamblyn, to hang out with her a bit longer; the open, energetic woman who talks to a stranger in a Detroit parking lot about the profile of her published that day in the New York Times.\n\nThere are echoes of the \u201cbad girl\u201d image that Hollywood crafted for her many years ago; in the E! program, McGowan longs for \u201cmore middle fingers\u201d to raise to those who would ignore her or shut her down. But McGowan, who is an executive producer of \u201cCitizen Rose,\u201d includes many revealing moments that even a reasonably good magazine profile would not be able to fully capture.\n\nShe talks to her mother about how difficult she was in the past, when she had psychologically shut down after her assault. For both women, the discussion is clearly painful \u2014 and unfinished. When she finds out that representatives for Harvey Weinstein \u2014 a man she does not name in the film \u2014 got a copy of her memoir in advance, she\u2019s silent and pale. It\u2019s another violation, another loss of control and autonomy to grapple with. Wearing a Taco Bell sweatshirt, scrunched up in a chair, she\u2019s not just anxious: She looks tired. It never ends.\n\nThe debut of \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d is to be followed in the spring by four additional episodes, and the first installment does have some structure: It roughly follows the dislocating timeline of last fall\u2019s revelations about Weinstein and many other high-profile men. On the day the first devastating report about Weinstein was published, McGowan is seen attending an anti-domestic violence rally and talking with survivors. As more bombshells drop, McGowan gives a speech to the Women\u2019s Convention, talks with reporters and visits her father\u2019s grave.\n\nSeveral times, McGowan opens up about her difficult relationship with her late father, who dealt with bipolar disorder before he died. The fact that she grew up in a cult with a documented history of inappropriate conduct relating to children receives some attention. But \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d flits from subject to subject and event to event fairly quickly, and there are some topics that are interesting and knotty enough to merit further exploration.\n\nPerhaps some subjects \u2014 notably how her parents ended up in the Children of God movement and McGowan\u2019s own entry into what she calls the cult of Hollywood \u2014 will get more attention in upcoming episodes. But as it stands now, as jittery as it is, the initial episode will likely be fascinating and even moving to those who have been closely following the #MeToo movement.\n\nIt\u2019s not slick; clips from a film McGowan directed are placed alongside cellphone videos of her being pulled over by a cop; there\u2019s footage of her heading into a magistrate\u2019s office in order to deal with an outstanding warrant; at one point, she walks along a city street, filming a nighttime snowfall with her phone. It\u2019s a collage of angry moments, impressionistic images and inspirational ideas, and McGowan\u2019s attempt to tell her past and present stories and express herself as an artist sometimes collide rather than commingle. But the sincerity that drives her campaign to make the world (and herself) \u201c10% more awake\u201d is readily apparent.\n\nThe touchstone of \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d is McGowan\u2019s own prickly, vulnerable yet charismatic presence, and that is enough to unify it and transmit the message that all survivors are unique and do not experience trauma and recovery in the same ways. For many, the initial injury is the first in a string of wounds, and the effectiveness of different methods of healing can change from one moment to the next, and from one person to the next. Survival is a choppy, not-quite-linear experience, but so is confronting the costs of fame.\n\nOne can feel McGowan\u2019s relief, and even glee, at finding yet another way to reclaim the narrative of her life. Having been seen through the lens of filmmakers, screenwriters, and reporters for so long, now she (and people working for her) wield the camera. She challenges and mocks her image as a \u201ckook,\u201d even as she effectively hypes her forthcoming book, \u201cBrave.\u201d She attacks the smooth branding of the Times Up movement even as she shares ambiguous feelings about how she\u2019s expressed herself at certain moments. And it\u2019s worth noting that \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d is, among other things, a canny piece of marketing. That\u2019s not a criticism, by the way; if someone is going to tell McGowan\u2019s story and leverage her fame in this surreal moment, it might as well be her.\n\nAll things considered, there\u2019s a core of truthfulness about the processing of pain and the search for connection that gives a solid foundation to the many splintered, whirling parts of \u201cCitizen Rose.\u201d The most fascinating moments allow the viewer to be a fly on the wall as McGowan meets with others who\u2019ve traveled similar paths. Her conversations with Ronan Farrow, who\u2019s written several blockbuster pieces about Weinstein, and with a group of women who talked to reporters about their treatment by men like Louis C.K., John Hockenberry and others, could have gone on even longer.\n\nAt one point, McGowan has a gripping one-on-one conversation with Asia Argento, another alleged victim of Weinstein. The word \u201cvictim\u201d is one that McGowan sometimes chooses to use; she has a conversation with Argento about whether that appellation, or \u201csurvivor,\u201d is more appropriate.\n\nThe women don\u2019t come to a neat conclusion, but their conversation \u2014 drawing as it does on a shared experience that they don\u2019t have to explain to each other \u2014 vibrates with recognition. It\u2019s as if long-lost sisters have met for the first time; that\u2019s how much barely suppressed emotion fills the room. There\u2019s no name for this kind of reunion, but it doesn\u2019t need a word to be powerful.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Freviews%2Frose-mcgowan-citizen-rose-e-documentary-review-1202680951%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202680951&comment_count=14", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rose-mcgowan-tca.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rose-mcgowan-tca.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maureen Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/reviews/rose-mcgowan-citizen-rose-e-documentary-review-1202680951/", "title": "TV Review: Rose McGowan in \u2018Citizen Rose\u2019 on E!", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The core of \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d is McGowan\u2019s own prickly, charismatic presence &amp; that is enough to unify the impressionistic docu series.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202680951, "author": "Maureen Ryan", "pmc-category": "Reviews", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-01-29T17:02:30"}, "pmc-tag": "Citizen Rose,Rose Mcgowan", "title": "TV Review: Rose McGowan in \u2018Citizen Rose\u2019 on E!", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "Reviews", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TV Review: Rose McGowan in \u2018Citizen Rose\u2019 on E!", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/reviews/rose-mcgowan-citizen-rose-e-documentary-review-1202680951/", "description": "There\u2019s a moment midway through \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d that encapsulates what the documentary does well.
