But she won\u2019t let go of Jamie.\u201d\n\nFoxx, 50, sparked breakup rumors earlier this month when he was spotted partying in Miami with multiple women, while Holmes, 39, was in Paris for Fashion Week. Foxx also was seen getting close to his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis on July 4 when they watched fireworks together in Malibu. On top of that, the \u201cRay\u201d actor was hit with allegations that he got rough with a woman during a sexual encounter in Las Vegas 2002 and tried to force her to have oral sex with him.\n\nWhile TMZ reported that Foxx won\u2019t face charges in that case because the statute of limitations had run out, Holmes is reportedly unhappy with his other behavior around women, Us magazine reported.\n\nNonetheless, Holmes is not ready to give up on the relationship, because she\u2019s \u201cabsolutely smitten\u201d with him, the insider told Us.\n\nPage Six reported that Holmes was heard declaring her love for the \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d actor after she boarded a flight to Paris. Suri, her 12-year-old daughter with Cruise, was with her, as was a friend and their nanny.\n\n\u201cKatie was FaceTiming Jamie after they boarded,\u201d a source told Page Six. \u201cShe said she loves him and asked if he wanted \u2018cookies from Paris.'\u201d\n\nHolmes and Foxx reportedly began dating in 2013 after Holmes divorced Cruise in 2012, but Holmes and Foxx went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret. That\u2019s because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.\n\nThey still have never publicly confirmed that they are a couple, though they did the next best thing in September 2017 by being photographed together, walking on a beach in Malibu holding hands.\n\nThen again, when RadarOnline reported in late June that the couple had split, Holmes representative went on the record to call the story \u201c100 percent untrue.\u201d Many outlets took the on-the-record denial as an official confirmation that there is \u2014 or was \u2014 a relationship.\n\nUs magazine said there are other challenges to the relationship, notably the fact that Holmes lives in New York City and Foxx is based in Los Angeles. But they see each other \u201cmore than people would think,\u201d a source said.\n\nThe key to Foxx\u2019s hold on Holmes is that he\u2019s \u201cmesmerizing,\u201d \u201centertaining\u201d and can always make her laugh, the source told Us. So, somehow it works for her \u2014 for now.\n\n\u201cShe has fun with him when they are together,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship that works for her.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babydriver_4.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/met_4.jpg?w=1024&h=785", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/met_4.jpg?w=1024&h=785", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
