The 42-year-old actor \u2014 who was being honored for her peformance in the new Woody Allen movie Wonder Wheel \u2014 began her speech by praising the creativity in the room before singling out Allison Janney as someone she greatly admired.\n\n\u201cAllison Janney is in this room. Allison, I know I don\u2019t really know you, but I just want to be you,\u201d she said. \u201cOr just stroke you, or something. I mean, we could always kiss, maybe? Maybe?\u201d\n\nThis was followed by Janney making her way to the stage for a quick smooch with Winslet much to their fellow stars\u2019 delight. \u201cOh, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Winslet exclaimed as the audience laughed. \u201cThis is an exciting moment, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nWatch the clip below.\n\nGet The Brief.
