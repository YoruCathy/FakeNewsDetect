In those seven years, Amber has shared all of the very high highs and very low lows of her life, and has had one of the most tumultuous journeys out of all the young women on the series. Then in 2014, Amber put out her first memoir \u201cNever Too Late\u201d and it became apparent that not everything was shared with the MTV cameras. So, go behind-the-scenes, and find 15 of the most shocking things about Amber, her life and filming that you never knew!\n\n15. Early Life\n\nAmber\u2019s story on 16 & Pregnant jumps right into her pregnancy with Leah, but her book gives fans a better idea just who Amber was before becoming pregnant at a young age. Amber goes into detail about her childhood, which started off with normal and happy family memories, but everything changed when her younger sister Candace, died at only two weeks old of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). \u201cAfter Candace died, my family started to deteriorate. That was the start of the bad times that turned everything into a blur in my memory,\u201d she wrote in the book and went on to reveal how both her parents developed drinking problems, but her dad\u2019s alcoholism turned her parent\u2019s relationship into nothing but screaming matches.", "images": ["https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/06/12739074.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/484044_10153756991595114_2102945264_n-150x150.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/06/Teen-Mom-2-Season-7.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2018/09/GettyImages-1020457050.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/10/12677907.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2019/11/Chelsea-and-Cole1.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/close.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2019/02/shutterstock_278054789-1.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2013/09/Leah-Remini.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/03/Jenelle-Evans-MTV.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/22670791-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2013/11/Holly-Madison.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop/qool-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/01/Teen-Mom-2.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/04/Teen-Mom-2-Cast.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_480,$w_895/f10/2016/09/Amber-Portwood-Never-Too-Late.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/03/04887721.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2016/09/Maci-Bookout1.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2015/10/Corey-and-Leah.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/12/Teen-Mom-2-Season-8-List.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2019/11/Chelsea-and-Cole1.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/01/09097457-1.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Amber-Portwood-Never-Too-Late-630x1024.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/12/shutterstock_76661803.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/10/Terra-Jole-2.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2015/10/09815477.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2018/03/18322821.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/JPI_Episode13832_0001864744-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2018/09/GettyImages-1020457050.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/hamburger.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FEB10fame10logo-web-1.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/03/Ellen-DeGeneres-Finger-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/08/09562406.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2017/06/12739074.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Amber-Portwood-Never-Too-Late-630x1024.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/teen-mom-15-shocking-revelations-from-amber-portwoods-never-too-late/", "title": "Teen Mom: 15 Shocking Revelations From Amber Portwood\u2019s \u2018Never Too Late\u2019", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Teen Mom: 15 Shocking Revelations From Amber Portwood\u2019s \u2018Never Too Late\u2019", "description": "Back in June of 2009, MTV fans were introduced to Amber Portwood with her episode of 16 & Pregnant, and for the subsequent seven years, she has continued to share her story as one of the four women picked for the hugely popular spin-off series, Teen Mom.
