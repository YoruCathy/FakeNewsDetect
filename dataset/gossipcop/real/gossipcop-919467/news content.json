I asked him to leave the house and he knocked me unconscious. He ran away from the police. THAT\u2019S the truth.\"\n\nNot so, said Anderson on Thursday, who also shares son Dylan, 20, with her ex-husband, to whom she was married from 1995 to1998.\n\nIn a post titled \"Alcoholism is the devil,\" Anderson, who is currently in France, wrote that Brandon had been putting together an intervention for his father. \"He just wants him to get sober,\" she said, adding that Brandon acted out of self-defense and \"punched him in the nose for all of us who he has hurt.\"\n\nMore:Tommy Lee claims 21-year-old son Brandon Lee assaulted him\n\n\"I pray Tommy gets the help he needs,\" she wrote. \"His actions are desperate and humiliating \u2014 he is a disaster spinning out of control. and he is not acting like a father.\n\nBut this is nothing new. My sons have made every attempt to help him in recent months - staying with him to make sure he\u2019s OK. Just by being present with him they were hoping he\u2019d feel loved and act differently. I feared things might escalate.\"\n\nBrandon confirmed he'd been trying to plan an intervention in a statement issued via his rep Teal Cannaday to USA TODAY early Thursday.\n\n\"I wanted my dad\u2019s hopeful sobriety and recovery to be a private family matter but, as a result of his accusations on social media, I feel forced to speak out,\" he said. \"I have and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as needed. I love my father and just want to see him sober, happy and healthy.\u201d\n\nAnderson called Lee the \"definition of narcissist/sociopath \u2014 his fianc\u00e9 keeps him drunk \u2014 this is what he wants \u2014 someone to behave badly with. It\u2019s terrible.\"\n\nThe former Baywatch star says she has blocked Lee's recent attempts to contact her. \"I will never talk to Tommy again before he is sober and in his right mind,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Though he\u2019s made attempts to contact me. I have blocked him. \"It is impossible to reason with crazy.\"\n\nAnderson added that Brandon doesn't want his father to go to jail. But \"him blaming his son or us for anything is delusional.\" Read her post here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5747284628001_5747280809001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c6d9142c570aa55de492d901066deec5d8bae90/c=0-85-2120-2911/local/-/media/2018/03/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636561271658270515-GettyImages-509506716.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89172bf39c12e95a7e441895ec69d6358fcee223/c=0-171-2120-1369/local/-/media/2018/03/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636561271658270515-GettyImages-509506716.jpg?width=2120&height=1198&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89172bf39c12e95a7e441895ec69d6358fcee223/c=0-171-2120-1369/local/-/media/2018/03/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636561271658270515-GettyImages-509506716.jpg?width=2120&height=1198&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/03/08/pamela-anderson-calls-tommy-lee-disaster-after-fight-son/408645002/", "title": "Pamela Anderson calls Tommy Lee 'a disaster' after fight with son", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Pamela Anderson calls Tommy Lee 'a disaster' after fight with son", "description": "Lee's ex-wife says his drinking is out of control and that their son Brandon \"punched him in the nose for all of us who he has hurt.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/03/08/pamela-anderson-calls-tommy-lee-disaster-after-fight-son/408645002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89172bf39c12e95a7e441895ec69d6358fcee223/c=0-171-2120-1369/local/-/media/2018/03/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636561271658270515-GettyImages-509506716.jpg?width=2120&height=1198&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2120, "height": 1198}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Andrea Mandell", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Lee's ex-wife says his drinking is out of control and that their son Brandon \"punched him in the nose for all of us who he has hurt.\"", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89172bf39c12e95a7e441895ec69d6358fcee223/c=0-171-2120-1369/local/-/media/2018/03/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/636561271658270515-GettyImages-509506716.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Pamela Anderson calls Tommy Lee 'a disaster' after fight with son", "description": "Lee's ex-wife says his drinking is out of control and that their son Brandon \"punched him in the nose for all of us who he has hurt.\""}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520438400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
