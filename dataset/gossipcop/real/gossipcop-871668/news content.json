Luke even got to wrap up the segment with Menzel, all by himself.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sing it like that,\u201d Menzel told the girls on the stage. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try tomorrow, I\u2019m so inspired.\u201d\n\nLuke told news station WFAA 8 that he\u2019d never received a standing ovation before, but he\u2019s already ready for his next performance.\n\n\u201cI know boys don\u2019t like \u2018Let It Go\u2019 because it\u2019s a \u2018girls\u2019 song,\u2019\u201d Luke said, rolling his eyes. \u201cBut I mean, songs are for everyone. It\u2019s music, it\u2019s art.\u201d\n\nWatch Luke\u2019s entire stint with Menzel below:", "images": ["https://media.virascoop.com/images/2017/03/27131511/Logo-reg.png",
