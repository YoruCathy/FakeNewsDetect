But like, it should be for $9.4 million, right? Wowza.\n\nThe Agency has the listing for the sprawling property, which contains 4 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, and 5,564 square feet on over an acre of land. It's set behind gates, so it's extra private and exclusive, and has the chef's kitchen of our dreams, with state-of-the-art appliances, marble countertops, and is open to the backyard, where you'll find a zero-edge pool, grill, and gazebo.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the house where Demi Lovato lived in California was put up for sale for 9.5 million dollars. In 2016, Demi bought the house for 8.3 million dollars. pic.twitter.com/4kiFAMEkUw \u2014 Demi Lovato Team (@DemiTeamTR) September 4, 2018\n\nThe home also has an insanely cool \"upper club level,\" with a bar, media room, and huge sky terrace. It's minutes from the Sunset Strip and set right above the Chateau Marmont, so the location is seriously choice.\n\nOur favorite part, though, is hands-down the panoramic city views from the living rooms floor-to-ceiling windows and the sky terrace. You can see all the way from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean, and it's giving us all the La La Land feels.\n\nSee the full listing at The Agency.\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sienna Livermore", "Commerce Editor", "Sienna Livermore Is A Commerce Editor At Hearst Covering Best-Selling Products", "Home Items", "Fashion", "Beauty", "Things You Just Can'T Live Without."], "canonical_link": "https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/real-estate/a22996176/demi-lovato-house-for-sale/", "title": "We're Freaking Out Over The Inside Of Demi Lovato's House", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "House Beautiful", "title": "We're Freaking Out Over The Inside Of Demi Lovato's House", "description": "Give our hearts a break.", "url": "https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/real-estate/a22996176/demi-lovato-house-for-sale/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 172224906175070, "pages": 29574925479}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HouseBeautiful", "modified_time": "2018-09-06 04:33:20", "published_time": "2018-09-05 10:44:00", "section": "Real Estate", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HouseBeautiful", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/demi-lovato-v01-1536187377.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "Sa3JJ4QuBXOmJXJfaWslZWwYXtlHijGPqZqp18aMldk", "title": "Demi Lovato's House is For Sale for $9.5 Million - See Inside Demi Lovato's Home", "description": "Demi Lovato's house just hit the market, and the inside is so gorgeous.
