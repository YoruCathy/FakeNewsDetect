{"url": "http://time.com/4990102/taylor-swift-gorgeous-listen/", "text": "As the clock struck midnight Thursday, a legion of Taylor Swift fans made a quick escape to their computers and smartphones to listen to the singer\u2019s brand-new song off upcoming album Reputation, \u201cGorgeous.\u201d\n\nTeased earlier in the day with a trio of hot-pink Instagram posts and an intriguingly vague snippet featuring a child\u2019s voice, \u201cGorgeous\u201d is the third single Swift has shared off of her Nov. 10 album, following the late-summer smash success of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d and follow-up anthem \u201c\u2026Ready For It.\u201d Both of those songs have charted well for Swift in the ensuing months, and \u2014 based purely on the undying strength of her fanbase \u2014 it would be a surprise if \u201cGorgeous\u201d didn\u2019t follow in their footsteps.\n\nFor this album, Swift has been experimenting with beat-forward electro-pop, steering clear of her previous country roots and eschewing her past detours into lite dubstep drops. Instead, her music references \u201980s and \u201990s sounds in its own style of minimalist rock-pop: a little bit punk, a little bit rap-sung, and plenty of catchy melody for good measure. And the lyrics? As ever, Swift stays personal, as past lyrics have alluded to the headlines and personalities that have influenced her path through stardom.\n\nSome super-fans have already listened to Reputation at private sessions hosted by Swift in London and her home in Rhode Island. But the rest will have to replay \u201cGorgeous\u201d for three more weeks. You can listen to \u201cGorgeous\u201d now, above.\n\nGet The Brief.
