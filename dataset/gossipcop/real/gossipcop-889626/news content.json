It was also the high point of just about every X-Men film. When his run finally ended with this year\u2019s Logan, many of us held out some hope to see him dawn the classic blue and yellow costume from the comics.\n\nJust like his close friend Deadpool\u2019s Ryan Reynolds, Jackman is known to jump on Twitter to have some fun with fans. Yesterday morning, Jackman went on Twitter to tease fans about what he\u2019s going to wear for Halloween this year.\n\nJust maybe I will finally wear blue and yellow spandex for my #halloweencostume #tootall pic.twitter.com/0IwL6GoHzZ \u2014 Hugh Jackman (@RealHughJackman) October 26, 2017\n\nThat\u2019s right, Hugh Jackman might finally be in the classic Wolverine costume. But not how we would have wanted to see.\n\nLogan Director James Mangold spoke with Screenrant.com about the issue with the yellow costume months ago and why it didn\u2019t work to put it in the movie.\n\nI always feel a certain contingent of fans who are yearning for it. But the biggest block I\u2019ve had \u2013 I\u2019m willing to take the heat for it \u2013 is that, I can never get past, being a writer for these movies as well, that Logan is the least narcissistic of all the superheroes, any kind I can think of \u2013 Marvel, DC or anywhere else. What I mean by that is, who puts a special branded outfit on when they do good deeds? And why? The only reason you do it is so you can have some sort of trademarked claim and get credit for what you did. Nothing seems less Wolverine-like than the desire to put on a trademarked outfit , particularly canary yellow, and kind of prance about doing good deeds and have people go, \u201cOh my God! It\u2019s The Wolverine!\u201d At least the Wolverine, as I see him, that\u2019s a real struggle for me and always has been. I somehow feel that if somehow we ever put Hugh [Jackman] into one of those outfits, people would not be happy. Essentially, it\u2019s something that lives on the page and I\u2019m not sure could live anywhere else.\n\nPersonally, I would have loved to see him run around in a big old yellow costume ripping people up. Unless you\u2019re going to trick or treat with the Aussie actor you won\u2019t get to see him in his full yellow glory.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping a photo of Jackman with the costume on makes it online!\n\n(Visited 179 times, 1 visits today)", "images": ["https://boundingintocomics.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://boundingintocomics.com/files/2020/03/2020.03.25-11.36-boundingintocomics-5e7beae935c64-360x240.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=317732228686583&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd3ac93af965dc7ebbdf0dbbfdaaeaae?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://boundingintocomics.com/files/2020/04/2020.04.14-12.08-boundingintocomics-5e94fef7aa785-360x240.png", "https://boundingintocomics.com/files/2017/10/GettyImages-127234401-e1509128095503.jpg", "https://boundingintocomics.com/files/2015/04/BiC_new_Logo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://boundingintocomics.com/files/2017/10/GettyImages-127234401-e1509128095503.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["If Starfleet Were Real His Career Would Be In A Much Different Place.
