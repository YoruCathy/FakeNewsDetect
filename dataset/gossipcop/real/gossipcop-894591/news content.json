In fact, he kind of forgot it was happening. Husband-and-wife country music stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill sat down with Jimmy Fallon and shared the hilarious story of how McGraw wound up meeting his daughter Gracie\u2019s boyfriend. And he couldn\u2019t have planned it better.\n\n\u201cI was on the road working,\u201d the singer told the late-night host. \u201cThey gave me a call and they said, \u2018You know, Gracie\u2019s going out on a date. Do you mind if she goes before you meet the guy?'\u201d\n\nMcGraw joked that he\u2019d already had the Secret Service check out the young man and everything was fine for Gracie go on the date. But once McGraw was back in town the next day, he did want Gracie\u2019s date to stop by just to meet him in person.\n\n\u201cAround noon, I want him to come by the house so I can say hi to him\u2014look him in the eye,\u201d he said.\n\nUpon arriving home, McGraw got busy into his routine and completely forgot about the boyfriend\u2019s visit. As he explained to Fallon:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a barbecue, so I\u2019m in the kitchen, and I forget that he\u2019s coming. I have a white apron on and a knife and I\u2019m trimming meat up, so I\u2019ve got chunks of meat all over this white apron, blood everywhere. The doorbell rings and I go and answer the door, and here\u2019s this kid who\u2019s dating Gracie standing there. I\u2019ve got a knife in my hand and a bloody apron on \u2026 It worked out really well!\u201d\n\nCan you imagine your dad greeting your boyfriend at the door covered in blood and holding a knife?! We\u2019re sure it was the perfect intimidation factor for the young man.\n\nHowever, these parents seem to be pretty big on letting their three daughters learn things on their own. So, even if McGraw hadn\u2019t scared this boyfriend with a knife, the dad probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten in the way of him dating his daughter.\n\nHappy 20th to my sweet, sweet girl. So beautiful, so talented and with a heart big enough to warm the world!!!! We are so proud of you and you are loved beyond measure.

What\u2019s their secret?\n\n\u201cWell, she tolerates a lot, I think that\u2019s probably the main reason,\u201d McGraw jokingly told \u201cToday.\u201d But Hill followed up with the real root of what helps them maintain a happy marriage: \u201cWe do actually like one another.\u201d Plain and simple.\n\nGetty Images | Frazer Harrison\n\nThe couple recently collaborated on an album together for the first time in their careers. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Rest of Our Life\u201d and is available now on iTunes.
