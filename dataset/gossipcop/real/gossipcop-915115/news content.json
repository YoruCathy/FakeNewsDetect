Following numerous tests, doctors diagnosed her with chronic liver and kidney damage, leading to failure of the organs.\n\nDoctors eventually told the family to focus on her quality of life, not the quantity.\n\n\u2018My strong mother has always been the anchor of this family\u2019\n\n\u2018My mom, Dana, always loves to laugh,\u2019 Haynes writes.\n\n\u2018Even when her liver & kidney doctors gave us the worst news you could get, my mom looked at us and said, \u201cThe best thing to do in these situations is to laugh.\u201d She then chuckled so loud you could hear it to the other end of the hospital.\u2019\n\nHe further explains a liver transplant can cure the diagnosis, but she doesn\u2019t have enough time.\n\nI\u2019t\u2019s heartbreaking. My strong mother has always been the anchor of this family and our best friend,\u2019 he shares. \u2018Now we\u2019re being forced to say goodbye to her.\u2019\n\nAfter receiving the news from Dr. Doom (his mom\u2019s choice of name), the family set her up at home for the time being.\n\nThe family set up a GoFundMe to provide a full-time nurse and travel expenses for them to be with her. Amazingly, donors reached the goal in only three days.\n\n\u2018Now that the goal has been reached,\u2019 Haynes writes, not ending his pursuit. \u2018Every single penny we raise over the goal from today on will be donated to the American Liver Foundation to help others who are going through this horrible disease. It would mean the world to my family & I if we could make a massive donation to this incredible organization.\n\n\u2018Thank y\u2019all for listening & sending all the love to my beautiful momma.\u2019", "images": ["https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2019/07/Police-and-residents-gather-outside-the-house-where-the-two-women-were-found-in-Pakistan.jpg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/02/Colton_Haynes.jpg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/gsn-logo-invert.gif", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2edb694130462e9a6ad8436690e868db?s=156&d=mm&r=g", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-li.svg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-gsn.svg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2019/07/Ricky_Ricky.jpg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-twitter.svg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/09/HIV_T9_NIAID_wikimedia_commons.jpg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/02/Adam_Rippon-3.jpg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/06/India_Wedding.jpg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/gsn-logo-invert-scroll.png", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-facebook.svg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-insta.svg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-youtube.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-tD_0qRFnqCSbj.gif"], "top_img": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/02/Colton_Haynes.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anya Crittenton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/colton-haynes-mother-health/", "title": "Colton Haynes writes heartbreaking post about mother\u2019s failing health", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Actor Colton Haynes took to Instagram Tuesday afternoon to share the heartbreaking news of his mother's declining health and the time she has left.", "original-source": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/colton-haynes-mother-health/", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Colton Haynes writes heartbreaking post about mother's failing health", "description": "Actor Colton Haynes took to Instagram Tuesday afternoon to share the heartbreaking news of his mother's declining health and the time she has left.", "url": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/colton-haynes-mother-health/", "site_name": "Gay Star News", "updated_time": "2018-06-06T14:25:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/02/Colton_Haynes.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/02/Colton_Haynes.jpg", "width": 850, "height": 550}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GayStarNews", "tag": "Medicine", "section": "Family", "published_time": "2018-02-20T23:48:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-06T14:25:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Actor Colton Haynes took to Instagram Tuesday afternoon to share the heartbreaking news of his mother's declining health and the time she has left.", "title": "Colton Haynes writes heartbreaking post about mother's failing health", "site": "@gaystarnews", "image": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/02/Colton_Haynes.jpg", "creator": "@anyacrittenton"}, "fb": {"pages": 166622430080749}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/colton-haynes-mother-health/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2020/01/cropped-0055_GSN_Favicon-01-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519170528.0, "source": "https://www.gaystarnews.com", "summary": ""}
