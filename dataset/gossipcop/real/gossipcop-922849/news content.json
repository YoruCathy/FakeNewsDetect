The news comes six weeks after the premiere of the lifestyle makeover show and less than three weeks after the debut of the hilarious cooking competition. Vulture notes that Netflix wants to release new episodes of both series by the end of the year.\n\nA reboot of a trend-setting early aughts TV show, Queer Eye introduced audiences to five new lifestyle experts \u2014 aka the Fab Five \u2014 including culinary aficionado Antoni Porowski. Shortly after the show\u2019s debut, a handful of publications questioned whether or not Porowski, who demonstrated how to make things like grilled cheese and dressed-up hot dogs, actually knew how to cook. The resounding answer to that question is: Yes, Antoni definitely does know how to cook, but also, he shouldn\u2019t have to do culinary backflips on Queer Eye as part of his job. The Fab Five want to instill confidence in the people they work with, and sometimes that involves showing a sad dad how easy it is to mix avocados with Greek yogurt for a light and fabulous party dip. Antoni is clearly not fazed by the haters.\n\nThanks for the wishes!! Plz send avo baskets, elementary how-to cookbooks and corgi puppies to my manager. Love you all \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Antoni Porowski (@antoni) March 14, 2018\n\nNailed It, meanwhile, is a game show wherein amateur bakers attempt to recreate elaborate pastry masterpieces in a limited amount of time. The key to the show\u2019s success is largely attributed to the comedic stylings of host Nicole Byer, and her charmed chemistry with judge Jacques Torres. Nailed It celebrates pastry triumphs and colossal kitchen blunders in equal measure.\n\nNetflix never releases ratings information, but the head of unscripted content, Bela Bajaria, points out that both shows generated great buzz on social media. \u201cAll of the cultural conversation and all the social media has increased every week,\u201d Bajaria says, referring to Queer Eye in particular. \u201cAnd that means people are feeling an emotional connection, and they want to share it. That doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still no word yet on whether or not Netflix\u2019s other big new food series, Ugly Delicious, is getting a second season order, but that seems like an easy green light given the social media response and online chatter. Stay tuned for updates on all of Netflix\u2019s food new food shows as they become available.\n\n\u2022 Netflix Orders More Queer Eye and Nailed It As Its Unscripted Push Continues [Vulture]\n\n\u2022
