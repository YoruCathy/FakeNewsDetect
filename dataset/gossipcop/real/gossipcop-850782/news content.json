In an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight, Abby revealed exactly how she plans to occupy her time while in jail: by working on a new series.\n\nThe former coach told ET that she plans on \"pitching a new show,\" adding, \"I have been so very successful \u2014 maybe that'll be some time to work.\" As for what type of show she has in mind? Naturally, \"there's dancing in it,\" she hinted. It'll definitely be interesting to see what Abby comes up with and whether her time in prison will play a role in this future project.\n\nPreviously:\n\nYesterday (Tuesday, May 9), former Dance Moms coach Abby Lee Miller was sentenced to 366 days in prison following charges of bankruptcy fraud. Abby had been accused of hiding $775,000 of her income, as well as bringing $120,000 of Australian currency into the United States without reporting the amount. Last June, the former coach pled guilty to both of those charges.\n\nNow Abby is speaking out about her sentencing. While appearing on Good Morning America, she shared her hopes for the future, explaining that she aims to \"be a smarter businesswoman and also to worry about myself\" upon her release from prison. During her interview, she also looked back on her time as a dance coach, adding: \"I have spent so much time and so much energy making other people's children stars. I didn't have any children of my own. These were my kids and I raised them like they were my kids.\"\n\nBut despite the fact that Abby maintains that her actions were unintentional, she acknowledges that she must own the punishment. In her interview with People yesterday, she explained, \"I made mistakes and I trusted people. But ultimately I have to take responsibility.\" Abby reportedly must turn herself in to prison within the next 44 days.\n\nRelated: Dance Moms' Abby Lee Miller Has Been Sentenced to a Year in Prison\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59132933648d4405a1e359dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/591329154ec3cd5cf98ff3ae/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-166541315.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5c55b926360bd63de94360f7/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/IMG_3946.JPG"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59132933648d4405a1e359dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["De Elizabeth", "De Elizabet"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/abby-lee-miller-opens-up-prison-sentence", "title": "Abby Lee Miller Opens Up About Her Prison Sentence", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "De Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Find out what former 'Dance Moms' coach Abby Lee Miller has to say about her upcoming prison sentence.", "id": "59130cb04ec3cd5cf98ff391", "keywords": "culture,abby lee miller,prison,dance moms,news", "news_keywords": "culture,abby lee miller,prison,dance moms,news", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59130cb04ec3cd5cf98ff391", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Find out what former 'Dance Moms' coach Abby Lee Miller has to say about her upcoming prison sentence.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/591329147efd7825958ed1a2/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-166541315.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/591329147efd7825958ed1a2/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-166541315.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The former 'Dance Moms' coach wants to stay busy.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59132933648d4405a1e359dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Abby Lee Miller Says She'll Work on a New Show in Prison", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/abby-lee-miller-opens-up-prison-sentence"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "The former 'Dance Moms' coach wants to stay busy.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59132933648d4405a1e359dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Abby Lee Miller Says She'll Work on a New Show in Prison"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
