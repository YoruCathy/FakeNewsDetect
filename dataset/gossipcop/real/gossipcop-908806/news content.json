And anyway, it\u2019s what she might do with the other four months that\u2019s most interesting to her lately. \u201cI want to have a variety show,\u201d she muses. \u201cI want to get my midwifery certification in direct-entry midwifery. I want to build schools. I want to join the Peace Corps. I want to paint more seriously. I want to help my children with their dreams.\u201d But for now, she\u2019s \u201chappy to be here talking with you in the present.\u201d She gives a knowing smile. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all there is.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re one of the rare musicians who manages to stay relevant with listeners younger than themselves. How much of that that is because you\u2019re good on social media?\n\nIf it\u2019s anything, it\u2019s that I understand where young people are coming from. I don\u2019t try and fight it. What\u2019s interesting to me about music and the younger generation is that what we hear on the radio is more about frequency and sound than words. People talk about \u201cmumble rap,\u201d but that\u2019s because they don\u2019t understand that the important thing is the vibration, not the words. The kids need vibrations, because their attention span is about three seconds.\n\nDoes that mean lyrics are less important than they used to be?\n\nI think so.\n\nSo what accounts for the success of someone like Kendrick Lamar?\n\nYou named a hip-hop artist and hip-hop is the people. Hip-hop is not separate from the people. It goes to where the people go, and part of what moves people is vibration. People pray for that kind of movement, they pray for a Kendrick. Kendrick getting his thoughts out plays a big role in other people\u2019s thoughts. That thinking becomes a collective thing, something that comes out of a need, and that exchange is a vibration, too.\n\nHow has hip-hop changed in the two decades since Baduizm?\n\nAs much as the people have changed. We\u2019re in such a different place. My son, Seven, is 19. I\u2019m seeing him evolve into this creature that I never thought I could create. Without even trying, he\u2019s an improvement on his father\u2019s design. His thinking. His logic. His compassion. It\u2019s an evolutionary cycle. People acted out in new ways when rock and roll first came out, and the blues, and bebop. Here\u2019s how I think of it: My favorite cartoon is The Flintstones. It\u2019s the funniest thing to me. But when my children are sitting with me trying to watch it, the whole frequency is too slow for them. Everything has sped up and recalibrated; the children are vibrating faster. They\u2019re way ahead of us. That\u2019s how hip-hop has changed.\n\nIs anything being lost in how younger people absorb music?\n\nYou can\u2019t roll a joint on the cover of a digital download.\n\nWhat music is exciting you right now?\n\nI\u2019m listening to new things I\u2019ve recorded \u2014 seeing if they might lead to bigger ideas. I\u2019m also listening to D.R.A.M. and Lil Uzi Vert. All new stuff because of Seven. XXXTentacion is another one.\n\nDo all the allegations against XXXTentacion affect how you think about his music? Or similarly, you just curated a great box set of Fela Kuti albums, and he\u2019s someone who it seems had retrograde attitudes about women.\n\nI would never suggest that I have the popular opinion on this. Because I don\u2019t.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on this larger discussion happening now about whether we can separate the art from the artist, be it XXXTentacion or Fela or Louis C.K. or Bill Cosby or whomever?\n\nIt takes me back to a story my grandmother told me about Jesus and Barabbas. Jesus is standing on one side, Barabbas is standing on the other side, and the people have to choose which one of them could go free. Some people started yelling, \u201cBarabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas!\u201d Then so many people were doing that that the others found safety in numbers, and they also started yelling, \u201cBarabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas!\u201d People walked up who didn\u2019t even know what was going on and they also started yelling for Barabbas to go free. I always think about that. It\u2019s so important to me.\n\nI think I follow, but can you tell me more about how that parable applies here?\n\nThat I don\u2019t want to get scared into not thinking for myself. I weigh everything. Even what you just asked me, I would have to really think about it and know the facts in each of those situations before I made a judgment. Because I love Bill Cosby, and I love what he\u2019s done for the world. But if he\u2019s sick, why would I be angry with him? The people who got hurt, I feel so bad for them. I want them to feel better, too. But sick people do evil things; hurt people hurt people. I know I could be crucified for saying that, because I\u2019m supposed to be on the purple team or the green team. I\u2019m not trying to rebel against what everybody\u2019s saying, but maybe I want to measure it. Somebody will call me and ask me to come to a march because such and such got shot. In that situation I want to know what really happened. I\u2019m not going to jump up and go march just because I\u2019m green and the person who got shot is green. The rush to get mad doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\n\nWell, I agree that as a culture right now, we\u2019re better at mobilizing out of a sense of injustice or anger than we are at figuring out what to do next.\n\nPeople can be bad for certain things. They could be bad around children. They could be bad with power. Are those people all \u201cbad\u201d? Could be. Maybe they need to get kicked off the planet. I don\u2019t know. Each thing is individual. There aren\u2019t rules for how we can or should think about something. We don\u2019t have to believe everything we\u2019re hearing. At least I don\u2019t think we do. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t watch this stuff.\n\nThe news, you mean?\n\nEverything. I read the description of an empath and I think I fit the description pretty well. It\u2019s about absorbing people\u2019s feelings.\n\nBut does that mean we shouldn\u2019t speak up when people, even good ones, do bad things or express hurtful ideas? When I was doing research for this interview \u2014 this is a slightly awkward question.\n\nYou can ask me anything.\n\nOkay, thank you. I know this is maybe a weird pivot, but I think it\u2019s relevant. When I was doing research for this interview I came across an article from after you\u2019d gone to Israel, where the Israeli press was linking you to Louis Farrakhan and his alleged anti-Semitism and it seemed that you were being criticized for defending him rather than denouncing anti-Semitism. I don\u2019t know if those reports were accurate, but isn\u2019t it valid to criticize the hurtful idea in an instance like that? Even if you respect the person who holds that idea?\n\nAbsolutely. But I never made a statement about Louis Farrakhan \u2014 ever. What you\u2019re talking about happened in Palestine. At the time, the working title of my album was Saviours\u2019 Day \u2014 which is a holiday for the Nation of Islam but also my birthday. So I\u2019d gone to Palestine and journalists asked me, \u201cDo you believe in Louis Farrakhan? Do you follow him?\u201d Sure I do. I\u2019ll follow anyone who has positive aspects. He single-handedly changed half of the Nation of Islam to clean eating, clean living, caring for their families. He has flaws \u2014 like any man \u2014 but I\u2019m not responsible for that. I said I\u2019ve appreciated what he\u2019s done for a lot of black Americans. I mean, I\u2019m not Muslim, I\u2019m not Christian, I\u2019m not anything; I\u2019m an observer who can see good things and bad things. If you say something good about someone, people think it means that you\u2019ve chosen a side. But I don\u2019t choose sides. I see all sides simultaneously.\n\nThat\u2019s not something most of us are good at.\n\nWe\u2019re not, and I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m also okay with anything I had to say about Louis Farrakhan. But I\u2019m not an anti-Semitic person. I don\u2019t even know what anti-Semitic was before I was called it. I\u2019m a humanist. I see good in everybody. I saw something good in Hitler.\n\nCome again?\n\nYeah, I did. Hitler was a wonderful painter.\n\nNo, he wasn\u2019t! And even if he was, what would his skill as a painter have to do with any \u201cgood\u201d in him?\n\nOkay, he was a terrible painter. Poor thing. He had a terrible childhood. That means that when I\u2019m looking at my daughter, Mars, I could imagine her being in someone else\u2019s home and being treated so poorly, and what that could spawn. I see things like that. I guess it\u2019s just the Pisces in me.\n\nI\u2019m perfectly willing to accept that you might be operating on a higher moral plane than I am, but I think going down the route of \u201cHitler was a child once too\u201d is maybe turning the idea of empathy into an empty abstraction.\n\nMaybe so. It doesn\u2019t test my limits \u2014 I can see this clearly. I don\u2019t care if the whole group says something, I\u2019m going to be honest. I know I don\u2019t have the most popular opinion sometimes.\n\nBut don\u2019t you think that someone as evil as Hitler, who did what he did, has forfeited the right to other people\u2019s empathy?\n\nWhy can\u2019t I say what I\u2019m saying? Because he did such terrible things?\n\nWell, yes. But it\u2019s also disheartening to hear you say that at a time, like now, when racism and anti-Semitism are so much in the air. Why would you want to risk putting fuel on that fire?\n\nYou asked me a question. I could\u2019ve chosen not to answer. I don\u2019t walk around thinking about Hitler or Louis Farrakhan. But I understand what you\u2019re saying: \u201cWhy would you want to risk fueling hateful thinking?\u201d I have a platform, and I would never want to hurt people. I would never do that. I would never even imagine doing that. I would never even want a group of white men who believe that the Confederate flag is worth saving to feel bad. That\u2019s not how I operate.\n\nI appreciate that. But I really struggle with the idea of how much we\u2019re supposed to make an effort to understand or have empathy for people who have dangerously backwards or hateful thinking. You want to take the moral high ground, but sometimes that also feels the same as ceding territory.\n\nYou got that Pisces in you, that two-fish.\n\nI am a Pisces, actually.\n\nI thought so. So am I. One fish is swimming upstream, one\u2019s swimming downstream. We are all living in a cognitive-dissonance reality. We want to live a certain way or do a certain thing, and we don\u2019t because we are emotionally attached to how the group thinks. The hive mentality takes over. But you know what\u2019s right in your mind and your heart, and if you\u2019re strong enough to detach from the hive then sometimes, just sometimes, you may be able to do the right thing.\n\nWhen did you realize you didn\u2019t see the world like most people?\n\nBack in Catholic school in Dallas. I was raised Baptist, but I went to Catholic school because it was better than the public school where I grew up. When I was there I thought it was odd that we didn\u2019t question what we were doing. What is this \u201cblood of the lamb\u201d? What does this mean? And whenever I would ask questions, I would either get manufactured answers or get in trouble for asking questions. I just thought I was not fit for society.\n\nAnd when did you realize you were?\n\nI guess at the time I discovered psychology in high school. I came across a sociologist named Irving Janis.\n\nGroupthink.\n\nYeah. Coming across his work, I realized what was happening to the other people and wasn\u2019t necessarily happening to me. That\u2019s when I said, \u201cOkay, I am a part of this, but a different part.\u201d\n\nErykah Badu. Photo: Rondo Estrello taken in Osaka Japan\n\nI was listening to the interview you did recently with Joe Budden, and he brought up the recurring cartoonish image of you as this sort of quasi-mystical sorceress who\u2019s always playing mind games with rappers.\n\nThe Erykah Badu legend.\n\nIs it frustrating to have that kind of legend follow you around? It seems pretty clearly rooted in a kind of sexism.\n\nI take advantage of it. It\u2019s a good thing if people think I\u2019m supposed to be some mystical creature that controls people\u2019s minds.\n\nHow do you take advantage of it?\n\nI keep the prestige going. I keep up the idea that I\u2019m mystical. The thing about this legend is, I get blamed if rappers do good or do bad \u2014 people think these rappers get all confused by my presence.\n\nCan you characterize that presence?\n\nThat I take rappers to the sunken place. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I do. I hope it\u2019s not.\n\nIs positive projection just as silly to you as that kind of negative projection? Your fans often talk about you online as if you\u2019re something closer to a magical unicorn rather than a living, breathing human being.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the same thing. In both ways \u2014 whether it comes from men or women \u2014 some people talk about me like I\u2019m a sex goddess, a magical creature, a unicorn. Those things are part of how people perceive me. I never think of it as derogatory. Even when there is an element of sexism to it I find it all hilarious. It means you\u2019re powerful \u2014 in a loving way.\n\nIt\u2019s been eight and ten years since your last two studio albums, which were both fairly political. Now we\u2019re here, in this political moment. Are you feeling at all inspired to make new music?\n\nYou know what\u2019s funny? I\u2019m thinking about music, but it\u2019s all about tuning forks, singing bowls, bells, drums. I went to South Africa and recorded drums from Soweto, from Johannesburg, just gathering sounds. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in right now \u2014 sound vibration. If I put out another project, it\u2019ll be like that. Maybe I\u2019m humming or primal wailing or tribal moaning. You know, I haven\u2019t written anything in five years.\n\nYou mean no new proper songs? You did put out that mixtape a couple years back.\n\nThat\u2019s right. If I\u2019m not inspired to write, I don\u2019t. Whether it\u2019s me as a singer or a dancer or a writer or a painter or a filmmaker or on Instagram or a mixtape, everything I do is coming out of a real need. I think Joni Mitchell is the one who said that singing, laughing, and crying come up out of the same need: to get stuff out. I just haven\u2019t had anything to say. I can\u2019t really force it. If I did, what I\u2019d be saying wouldn\u2019t be coming from an honest place. Or maybe I\u2019ve said all the things I feel like saying.\n\nWhat about performing live? Have your feelings about that changed?\n\nThey haven\u2019t. I feel the most like me when I perform. That\u2019s why I do it so much \u2014 never had a vacation. No matter what\u2019s going on in my life or the world, performing feels new every time, and I can get to where I need to be to have a good show every single night.\n\nWhere do you need to to be?\n\nIt\u2019s about becoming a living, breathing organism with the people. And it always happens. I never have a bad show.\n\nYour situation is different, but what you were saying a minute ago about how you can\u2019t create new music unless you feel an honest compulsion to do it is making me think about how some of the most important musicians of your generation \u2014 people like Lauryn Hill, Andr\u00e9 3000, D\u2019Angelo \u2014 had long periods where they went silent. Do you think they felt the same way you do?\n\nI don\u2019t want to speak for those people. I know all of them, and there are individual circumstances for why each of them were quiet in different moments.\n\nIs there any unfulfilled potential among that group?\n\nWhen you say unfulfilled potential, wouldn\u2019t that have to be determined by the person? Whose fulfillment are we talking about?\n\nI know what you mean, but to go years without hearing \u2014\n\nD\u2019Angelo did what he came to do. He never had to make another record. Lauryn continues to make music. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s putting it out, but she\u2019s always recording. I think we have something in common, us neo-soul musicians, and that\u2019s honesty. Making music hurts, or it feels good, and we do it when we have to. And sometimes we don\u2019t.\n\nJust as a selfish fan, it\u2019s hard not to wonder about what music someone like D\u2019Angelo could\u2019ve been making all those years he was away.\n\nLife happens. Shit happens. Family members die. Your relationship gets fucked up. Your record label does some shit. Lauryn has six children. There are so many different circumstances why someone might not make music. It is selfish of you to want more from those people, and that\u2019s fine. Everybody has their own shit.\n\nWhat\u2019s your shit?\n\nI don\u2019t have no shit right now, and I\u2019m so fucking happy about it. I don\u2019t have a lot of needs, so maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have any shit.\n\nI saw a story the other day that said that in 2017, for the first time, hip-hop passed rock as the most popular style of music. Is it hard to square the cultural movement we\u2019ve undergone as a country with the political backsliding we\u2019re in the middle of?\n\nThat conflict makes sense, because change is hard. The culture is changing and people are resisting that. The world is sick of the old shit. The people are sick of being angry. They\u2019re sick of hate. They\u2019re sick of color. They\u2019re sick of race. They\u2019re sick of age. But you\u2019re always going to have people who are resistant to progress. People have such a hard time being uncomfy for a minute.\n\nHow do you talk with your younger children about politics?\n\nThey talk with me about it. They say the typical little girl things like \u201cTrump\u2019s a mean man and he wants to send my friends back to Mexico.\u201d We don\u2019t elaborate any more than that, because that\u2019s all that they need to be preoccupied with right now. But I\u2019m not a political chick at all. I\u2019m macrocosmic in lieu of microcosmic. I see a whole big picture. I see freedom for the slaves and the slave masters. For everybody. We\u2019re just emerging into a new state of being altogether, and the anger now is about people scared of that change. What I\u2019m talking about is Baduizm, and I see Trump as part of the resistance to that.\n\nWhat\u2019s Baduizm?\n\nThe way I see things.\n\nDoes Baduizm now mean the same thing as it did when Baduizm came out 20 years ago?\n\nI\u2019ve learned so many things since then. I\u2019ve changed in a way that involves elimination for the sake of evolution. There\u2019s less emphasis on trying to figure things out. It\u2019s about letting things be. I\u2019m focusing on listening to the silence underneath everything. That\u2019s what I try to connect with. I can listen to the silence right here, right now while we\u2019re talking, and it feels so good. I\u2019m in love with the silence.\n\nSo you see Trumpism as a short-term reactionary thing?\n\nThe thing about Trump is that he\u2019s a bad guy to the point where it looks manufactured. Are we playing games here? He can\u2019t really be that bad. I\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist at all \u2014 I don\u2019t give a shit about that stuff \u2014 but it looks like Trump\u2019s just trying to spark division. It looks like a game. Why are we being toyed with?\n\nDoes feeling like you\u2019re being toyed with make you want to disengage?\n\nWe can\u2019t help but to engage. There\u2019s no way I can live without engaging and doing service for others. I\u2019m a doula. I\u2019m a health practitioner and a Reiki master. These things come easy to me.\n\nYou actively work as a doula?\n\nYeah.\n\nHow do you find the families you work with?\n\nSerendipity. It\u2019s always easy to find someone pregnant that needs me. It just happens, you know? I met one lady I worked with at a restaurant. I\u2019ve assisted births at home, at birthing centers, at a hospital, in the woods. It all depends on the person and their story. Like Bruce Lee says, you have to be like water, and fit in any container. I also sit at the bedside of people who are dying. So I do the opposite of birth work \u2014 it\u2019s beings coming in and beings going out.\n\nWhat do you do at the bedside of someone who\u2019s dying?\n\nDepends on the person. Some want to listen to Richard Pryor. Some want to listen to gospel. Some want to talk. Some want to cry. Some haven\u2019t seen their children in a long time; I\u2019ll go find those children and let them know what\u2019s going on. Whatever service is needed, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I just want people to be at peace.\n\nI\u2019ve read you describe yourself as a \u201cspiritual\u201d person. What does that mean to you?\n\nI lead with my emotions, my feelings, and my thoughts \u2014 I like to describe that as spirit. When I\u2019m meeting people, it\u2019s about the spirit first. I think in the Hindu religion it\u2019s called Namaste: the divine in me recognizes the divine in you. No matter what our background was or what we were programmed to think or what our egos want us to believe about each other, there\u2019s something about looking in someone\u2019s eyes and connecting with them, their struggle, their whole shit \u2014 that\u2019s what I want to do. That\u2019s spiritual to me.\n\nYou\u2019re your own manager, which is extremely rare for a musician at your level. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to have someone else dealing with the business side?\n\nI\u2019ve never had a manager, and it\u2019s so I could be as lazy as I want and procrastinate whenever I want. I also want to be able to live outside of the music business. If I want to take off a year and raise my child, or pace myself in some other way, I can do it without having to explain it to anyone. And I\u2019ve been blessed with organizational skills. I\u2019m always late, though.\n\nI noticed. I was sitting here for like an hour-and-a-half before you showed up.\n\n[Laughs] I know. I\u2019m sorry. When it comes to my business, though, I\u2019m very organized. I just want to be able to do things without guilt. I used to operate out of guilt.\n\nWhat did you feel guilty about?\n\nWhen I first got a record deal, I felt guilty that I was able to do certain things that the people I grew up with were not able to do. It was no fun going back home to Dallas and driving a new car. It was always a heavy, nervous feeling all over my body when I\u2019d come home, feeling like I\u2019d be judged by the people in town if I was seen as flaunting my success. Or people would expect you to do something for them, or think you weren\u2019t doing enough. Oh, you know what? I spun out of that when I went to Cuba, illegally, in 2000.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThat trip was the trip where I left behind the big headwrap I used to wear. I got a story about that. Want to hear it?\n\nYeah, of course.\n\nI was dating Common. After Andr\u00e9 [Benjamin] and I split, Common and I fused into a couple in some kind of way. And he took me to Cuba. He said he wanted me to get a Santer\u00eda reading there.\n\nI can\u2019t believe you fell for that line.\n\n[Laughs] That line works! I was into Candombl\u00e9 back then too. And La Regla de If\u00e1. That kind of thing was so exciting to me. And at that time, I was wearing all white, with a towering white headwrap \u2014 I thought that if people saw white, it would attract great energy. So Common took me to Cuba, and we went to meet an interpreter named Pablo who led us to where the Santer\u00eda reading was. And we got there and were waiting in line on the curb with everyone else who was there for a reading. On my right was this man smoking a cigar, and he had on the dirtiest Pumas I had ever seen in my life. On my left was a man who had on the tightest white shorts \u2014 you could see his nuts. I was okay with that. I wasn\u2019t okay with those two passing a cigarette back and forth over the white shit I was wearing. But we were in Cuba, and it was their home, so I went with it. Finally, this short little lady in a long yellow dress came out and said it was my turn.\n\nThen what happened?\n\nSo she brought me into a little room in a house with no ceiling. I was kneeling on the floor and she was washing my headwrap; it was a ritual, to soften my spirit. Pablo was explaining everything to me. Then a girl came in, without knocking, and reached over me to grab something off a clothesline. And I\u2019m thinking, This reading is a dream for me, and people are just coming in like that? So we kept going, and then the man with the Pumas came in and was just standing there with a beer. And I\u2019m like, Wait a minute, this is not what I had in mind. And Pablo turns to me and says, \u201cHe\u2019s the priest.\u201d Then I changed. I didn\u2019t need the headwrap anymore.\n\nWhat exactly was the epiphany?\n\nIn that moment, I realized that you don\u2019t have to meet anyone else\u2019s expectations. You don\u2019t have to conform to anything other than who you are. The guy in the Pumas came from a long line of healers, and he didn\u2019t have to look like one to be one.\n\nDo you remember the actual reading?\n\nI don\u2019t. Maybe it was something like \u201cDon\u2019t get with Common.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a more recent epiphany?\n\nOne of my children was asking me, \u201cMom, when we die, do we come back?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But that sounds good.\u201d \u201cDo we choose the people we want to be with when we come back?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But maybe we do.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, when I die, I\u2019m going to choose to be with you again.\u201d It was easy tears. It made me think that all that matters is how she sees me. But, I\u2019m sorry, did I offend you in any way earlier when you thought I was defending anti-Semitism?\n\nI wasn\u2019t offended. It\u2019s more that I was worried \u2014\n\n\u201cIs she about to get in here and Black Power me to death?\u201d\n\nNo no, not that at all. But I think partly it\u2019s that, as a Jew \u2014\n\nOkay, I could tell.\n\nIs it my schnoz?\n\nJust, you got a whole Jewish thing.\n\nI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\n\nIt is. A sexy Jewish thing.\n\nBut no, I wasn\u2019t offended.\n\nOh good. That makes me happy.\n\nIt\u2019s more that I think having empathy for people with harmful ideas but not sympathy for the ideas themselves is maybe an impossible needle to thread. But what do I know? Maybe I\u2019m rigid. I wasn\u2019t trying to put you in a difficult spot.\n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t trying to put you in one. I was so surprised when I read that people thought I\u2019d said something anti-Semitic. I went to Palestine because I cared about the Palestinian children, and I was there doing work for them. Then someone twisted what I\u2019d said around and made me into a villain or something.\n\nIt\u2019s striking to me that even when you\u2019re talking about sensitive subjects like this, you\u2019re so calm and self-possessed. What makes you nervous?\n\nI\u2019m over being scared. When I feel the heart rate going or the palms getting sweaty, I start looking for the silence. And when I\u2019m calmed down, I realize I\u2019ve been thinking about the past or the future, which is not even here. I just come back to the moment. I remember watching Star Wars \u2014\n\nWhich one?\n\nOne of the ones from the \u201990s. This relates to what we\u2019re talking about. I saw this one scene in Star Wars \u2014 the guy was fighting the Sith Lord with the red and black face.\n\nDarth Maul. That was The Phantom Menace.\n\nYeah, you know what I\u2019m talking about. There was one scene where they were fighting, and they got to these doors that would close and then open up 30 seconds later. So at one point, the guy \u2014 who am I talking about?\n\nIt was Liam Neeson\u2019s character who was fighting Darth Maul \u2014 Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nYeah, and he turned and flipped and he and Darth Maul were on opposite sides of a door. So you have Darth Maul standing there, ready for that door to open, and Qui-Gon Jinn does this [Badu briefly kneels on the ground with her eyes closed] just for a few seconds, then he gets up. He took a deep breath and then started back fighting. That must\u2019ve been the scariest moment of that man\u2019s life and this motherfucker just got down on one knee and took a breath? That\u2019s some Jedi shit! I fell in love with that. Whenever I\u2019m afraid, I do that: Take a minute and breathe. No matter how scary something is, doing that helps it go away. So it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have fear, but I manage fear pretty fucking well.\n\nWhat\u2019s something you\u2019re still learning to do?\n\nYou can build a whole fucking world on the shit I don\u2019t know. I used to want to appear like I knew everything, and now my favorite answer to give is \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I just love to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It makes life a whole lot easier.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nAnnotations by Matt Stieb\n\n*A version of this article appears in the February 5, 2018, issue of New York Magazine.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/19/19-erykah-babu.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6a1/636/c87a3f57e12e1f387307e4e36ee59dabce-19-erykah-babu.2x.h600.w512.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/19/19-erykah-babu-1.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/19/19-erykah-babu.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Marchese", "Rondo Estrello"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/erykah-badu-in-conversation.html", "title": "Erykah Badu, In Conversation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Erykah Badu on Jedi Mind Tricks and How Millennials Hear Music", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/erykah-badu-in-conversation.html", "description": "\u201cYou can\u2019t roll a joint on the cover of a digital download.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/19/19-erykah-babu.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "In Conversation: Erykah Badu", "description": "\u201cYou can\u2019t roll a joint on the cover of a digital download.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/19/19-erykah-babu.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-24T08:00:03.455-05:00", "tag": "in conversation, erykah badu, music, vulture homepage lede, new york magazine", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Talking to R&B singer Erykah Badu about  Jedi mind tricks, how millennials hear music, and not taking rappers to the sunken place.", "sailthru.tags": "in conversation, erykah badu, music, vulture homepage lede, new york magazine", "author": "David Marchese", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516798803.455, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
