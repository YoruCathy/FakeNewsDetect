And some photos that looked like her boyfriend, screenwriter Jamie Linden, was carrying a bundled baby. Then there were paparazzi shots of McAdams, beloved for her role as iconic Mean Girl Regina George, toting a boy on her hip.\n\nBut the 40-year-old Canadian actress had not confirmed it until she told U.K. paper The Sunday Times that she gave birth to a son in April. She said it was, \"The greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, hands down.\"\n\nWaiting to become a mom\n\nMcAdams was 39 when she gave birth. She didn't want to have children before \"it was the right time,\" she told the magazine.\n\nTurned out, it was.\n\n\"[People say] your life is not your own anymore. But I had 39 years of me, I was sick of me. I was so happy to put the focus on some other person. I waited a long time [for motherhood].\"\n\n'I need to get a life'\n\nMcAdams is managing as well as any new mom, joking that she can barely get herself dressed. But she celebrates the small successes and focuses on the giggles instead of the gaffes.\n\n\"I have clothes on and that\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m wearing today. The shoes are held together with glue. Isn\u2019t that sad? I need to get a life. \"I\u2019m having more fun being a mum than I\u2019ve ever had. Everything about it is interesting and exciting and inspiring to me. Even the tough days \u2014 there\u2019s something delightful about them.\"\n\nAnd here comes the big news: McAdams hasn't ruled out a second baby.\n\nHer son, whose name she didn't reveal, has given her a clarity she hasn't known before.\n\n\"You see everything through a particular lens: very sensitive, more open. It\u2019s like being on an (airplane) all the time.\"\n\nCan we expect more mommy updates soon?\n\nUhhh..that's a big, fat no. McAdams, who was most recently seen in \"Disobedience\" with Rachel Weisz, said she values her privacy. She's not even sure how social media platforms work, isn't good at sharing her \"brand\" and doesn't want to.\n\n\"I\u2019m not a great self-promoter, I wasn\u2019t good at selling Girl Guide cookies or Christmas wrapping paper,\" she said.\n\nAh, well. It's not like she's going to have a lot of extra time on her hands now anyway. Especially if she gets busy with a second child.\n\nREAD MORE:", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/26/USAT/b339f0f3-2f22-46c6-8b1a-61b6540a2462-McAdamsx.jpg?width=615&height=410&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/26/USAT/b339f0f3-2f22-46c6-8b1a-61b6540a2462-McAdamsx.jpg?crop=614,349,x0,y27&width=614&height=349&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/26/USAT/b339f0f3-2f22-46c6-8b1a-61b6540a2462-McAdamsx.jpg?crop=614,349,x0,y27&width=614&height=349&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/11/27/rachel-mcadams-reveals-details-pregnancy-she-kept-secret-motherhood/2120476002/", "title": "Rachel McAdams opens up about pregnancy she kept secret, motherhood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Rachel McAdams opens up about pregnancy she kept secret, motherhood", "description": "The \"Mean Girls' actress and 40-year-old new mom revealed her son was born in April to \"The Sunday Times,\" saying he's the best thing to ever happen.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/11/27/rachel-mcadams-reveals-details-pregnancy-she-kept-secret-motherhood/2120476002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/26/USAT/b339f0f3-2f22-46c6-8b1a-61b6540a2462-McAdamsx.jpg?crop=614,349,x0,y27&width=614&height=349&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 614, "height": 349}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sonja Haller", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The \"Mean Girls' actress and 40-year-old new mom revealed her son was born in April to \"The Sunday Times,\" saying he's the best thing to ever happen.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/11/26/USAT/b339f0f3-2f22-46c6-8b1a-61b6540a2462-McAdamsx.jpg?crop=614,349,x0,y27&width=614&height=307&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Rachel McAdams opens up about pregnancy she kept secret, motherhood", "description": "The \"Mean Girls' actress and 40-year-old new mom revealed her son was born in April to \"The Sunday Times,\" saying he's the best thing to ever happen."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543248000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
