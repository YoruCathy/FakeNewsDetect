Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Nick Offerman also star, with Drew Goddard directing from his own script. Goddard also produced \u201cBad Times.\u201d\n\nBridges is warned by the clerk, \u201cThis is not a place for a priest, father,\u201d and admits later in the trailer, \u201cCan I confess something to you? I\u2019m not really a priest.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not quite clear from the trailer why the characters have come to the El Royale and the studio\u2019s description of the plot is somewhat obscure: \u201cSeven strangers, each with a secret to bury, meet at Lake Tahoe\u2019s El Royale, a run-down hotel with a dark past.
