Well, the 33-year-old certainly sparked speculation after taking to her Instagram story on Saturday, Sept. 30, to share a snap of a huge diamond ring on THAT finger!\n\nAmber and 21 Savage, whose real name is Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, have been dating for some months now and the two seem to be happier than ever. Between packing on the PDA at red carpet appearances and totally gushing over one another in interviews, it\u2019s really no surprise that the duo would want to take their relationship to the next level. Watch the video below to see her huge ring!\n\nJust this past weekend the couple made an appearance at Amber\u2019s third annual SlutWalk. And in a lifestream for the feminist march, Amber and her man answered fan questions, some of which dealt with the status of their relationship. \u201cAre we married? Someone asked if we\u2019re married,\u201d Amber said, reciting one of the questions that came through. \u201cWe\u2019re not married. I love him, though.\u201d To which 21 Savage quickly responded, \u201cWe\u2019re getting married at SlutWalk,\u201d obviously joking.\n\nThis comes shortly after Amber gifted a $50,000 ring to her 24-year-old beau. The ring, which the mother-of-one gave to her maybe-fianc\u00e9 ahead of the 2017 VMAs, is an 18-karat gold promise ring comprised of over 1,000 stones, according to TMZ. The band is a made up of white diamonds and red rubies and \u201cLoyalty 21\u201d is spelled out on it.\n\nBack in August, Amber admitted to TMZ that she had thoughts of marrying her boo. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about how much in love I am, how happy I am,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI just got back from Atlanta. I\u2019m in love, I\u2019m happy. I wanna marry him, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chrissy-teigen-stretch-marks.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amber-rose-becky.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/amber-rose-21-savage-engaged.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amber-rose-hair-black-bob.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/amber-rose-21-savage-engaged.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/amber-rose-21-savage-engaged.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/amber-rose-and-21-savage-engaged-143175/", "title": "Are Amber Rose and 21 Savage Engaged?
