Christina Aguilera\u2018s incredible Tonight Show musical impressions of pop divas like Cher, Shakira, and more have gone viral, but nothing was more spot-on than her take on former pop rival Britney Spears. Here, Us Weekly rounds up the sweetest and shadiest comments the former Mickey Mouse Club stars have made about each other.\n\nFRIENDS\n\nThe girls \u2014 who share a lot in common, after all \u2014 have had their moments, supporting each other publicly.\n\nPHOTOS: Britney's amazing music video looks\n\n1. In a 2005 blog post on her official site, Spears, now 33, derailed rumors that she hated Aguilera, 34. \u201cBritney would love to be close with Christina again,\u201d her site read. \u201cIn fact, Britney recently wrote Christina a letter telling her how happy and beautiful Christina looks lately.\u201d\n\n2. In 2011, Aguilera tweeted public support for her fellow pop star and her seventh studio album release.\n\nHey @BritneySpears Congrats on Femme Fatale release! Can\u2019t wait to see what you bring in the next video. xo \u2013 Xtina \u2014 Christina Aguilera (@xtina) March 29, 2011\n\n3. In a 2012 press conference for The Voice, Aguilera was asked the question about Spears joining rival reality TV show The X Factor. \u201c[We were in the] Mickey Mouse Club. We were very close, and our paths have always crossed and, interestingly, they will continue to cross,\u201d Aguilera told reporters (as detailed by HitFlix). \u201cI welcome her to this family of fun and entertainment and finding new talent as well\u2026.I don\u2019t know what [advice] she\u2019s going to offer specifically, but I know she\u2019s a pro\u2026I think she\u2019s going to give great advice.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Xtina's sexy music video looks through the years\n\nFOES\n\n1. In a 2004 interview with Us Weekly, Aguilera dissed Spears ahead of her wedding to now-ex Kevin Federline. \u201cI know Britney,\u201d Aguilera told Us at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s not trailer trash, but she sure acts that way.\u201d\n\n2. That wasn\u2019t all! Aguilera also was in utter disbelief that Spears had purchased her own diamond rock. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that girl bought her own engagement ring!\u201d she told Us. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it, up close. It looks like she got it on QVC.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Brit's many Us Weekly covers through the years\n\n3. In a December 2003 interview with Blender magazine, Aguilera called out Spears as \u201cdistant\u201d during rehearsals for their MTV Video Music Awards performance with Madonna. \u201cEvery time I tried to start a conversation with her \u2014 well, let\u2019s just say she seemed nervous the whole time,\u201d Aguilera told the mag. \u201cShe seems to me like a lost little girl, someone who desperately needs guidance.\u201d\n\n4. Spears, who caught wind of Aguilera\u2019s comments, subsequently slammed the \u201cDirrty\u201d singer in the January 2004 issue of Blender. Spears noted that she hadn\u2019t seen Aguilera in two years when they ran into each other in a weird encounter. \u201cShe comes up to me in a club in front of all these people and tries to put her tongue down my throat!\u201d Spears claimed. \u201cI say, \u2018It\u2019s good to see you,\u2019 and she goes, \u2018Well, you\u2019re not being real with me.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Well, Christina, what\u2019s your definition of real? Going up to girls and kissing them after you haven\u2019t seen them for two years?'\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Xtina's body evolution\n\n5. Spears continued ripping Aguilera in the interview and said: \u201cA lost girl? I think it\u2019s probably the other way around. I can\u2019t believe she said that about me. When someone has been rude to you so many times, it\u2019s like, \u2018You know what, Christina, I\u2019m really not about the fake anymore.'\u201d\n\n6. 2012 marked Aguilera\u2019s first time ever working alongside producer Max Martin. In an interview with Billboard, the \u201cYour Body\u201d singer tossed some subtle shade at her fellow pop stars who had previously worked with him.\n\n\u201cMax is legendary in the business. He\u2019s known about me but we haven\u2019t crossed paths,\u201d she said. \u201cI think when I came in you heard his name with Backstreet Boys, \u2018N Sync, Britney Spears \u2014 those records were the kind I wanted to stray apart from.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1424801136_xtina-britney-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Britney-Christina-022415-inline.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1424801136_xtina-britney-zoom.jpg?w=200&h=113&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1424801136_xtina-britney-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/christina-aguilera-britney-spears-friendship-what-theyve-said-2015242/", "title": "Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears: What They've Said About Each Other", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears' friendship has been rather confusing over the years -- Us Weekly digs up their sweetest and shadiest comments", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Friends or Foes?
