But I had never seen her perform this close up. There is no fuss with Biles. No ego, no entourage - unless you count her mum, Nellie, who tagged along for the incredibly laid-back interview.\n\nAfter an amicable split with her long-term coach she has a new coaching partnership and said recently she feels happier and healthier than ever. A lot of that she puts down to the 18-month break she took after Rio, a break where she swam with sharks, socialised like never before - and drank plenty of chocolate shakes!\n\nShe's improved on her nemesis, the bars. She reigns supreme on the vault and floor and has added improvements to the routines which won her gold in Rio, but she now has a new ambition - to make the individual bars final in Doha. Something seems to have just clicked.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/240/cpsprodpb/E7F7/production/_111838395_olympics1.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/cpsprodpb/146FC/production/_103780738_simonebilesindex2.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/cpsprodpb/B14B/production/_103778354_bilesgetty.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/240/cpsprodpb/16967/production/_111791529_steve_davis_1982_rexfeatures.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=gymnastics::sport.gymnastics.story.45795697.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:19969438-6490-cb42-8618-106a109fa45a]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_GNL]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/240/cpsprodpb/19FD/production/_111835660_premierleagueball.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/cpsprodpb/146FC/production/_103780738_simonebilesindex2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gymnastics/45795697", "title": "Simone Biles: Speaking about Larry Nassar abuse empowered me", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=377388936, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/sport/gymnastics/45795697", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BBC Sport", "application-name": "BBC Sport", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-sport-page-app-meta/2.0.0/images/web-icons/bbc-sport-144.png", "theme-color": "#ffd230", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "BBC Sport", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gymnastics/45795697", "title": "Abuse evidence 'empowered' me - Biles", "description": "Simone Biles says she felt \"empowered\" after speaking out against her sexual abuser and US gymnastics team doctor, Larry Nassar.", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/cpsprodpb/146FC/production/_103780738_simonebilesindex2.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": "1392506827668140,137920769558355,193435954068976,118450564909230,100978706649892,15286229625,21263239760,122103087870579,120655094632228,102814153147070,124715648647,153132638110668,150467675018739,1033940569952576,857410004307950,624989267645024,1471706783148263,228735667216,317278538359186,958681370814419,260967092113,168895963122035,114010462015043,8251776107,273726292719943,232455204224,1436581493296609,8585725981,8244244903,470911516262605,413132078795966,7519460786,1470145583204829", "admins": 100004154058350}, "description": "Simone Biles says she felt \"empowered\" after speaking out against her sexual abuser and US gymnastics team doctor, Larry Nassar.", "robots": "index", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
