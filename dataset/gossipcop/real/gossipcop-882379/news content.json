They stood together and smiled for the British and American news media before sitting in adjoining club chairs placed in front of their countries\u2019 respective flags.\n\nThe first lady sported a gray Dior pantsuit with a cropped hem, a look she has favored on many occasions.\n\nWhy Melania Trump is obsessed with culottes: An explanation\n\nMrs. Trump\u2019s decision to lead the U.S. delegation, whose members include Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, professional golfer Nancy Lopez and entertainer Wayne Newton, reflects the first lady\u2019s \u201cutmost respect\u201d for the hard work, courage and sacrifice of the U.S. military, said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump.\n\n\u201cShe feels strongly that they \u2014 and their families \u2014 should be honored every day,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nGrisham said Mrs. Trump also has \u201cgreat admiration for the role the games have played in empowering those who have been injured while serving.\u201d\n\nAt a recent event marking the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force, the first lady thanked the many military members who assisted thousands of people in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and the Caribbean whose lives were upended by recent hurricanes.\n\nA native of Slovenia who became a U.S. citizen in 2006, Mrs. Trump also thanked service members\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cYou endure time apart, are expected to move when new orders come in, and face the uncertainty that can come in times of need,\u201d she said at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before introducing her husband. \u201cThis kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of courage and your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated.\u201d\n\nMrs. Trump has been slowly warming up to her new role, waiting to move to the White House until her 11-year-old son finished the school year in New York and holding few public events of her own. She accompanied the president on his three overseas trips so far this year.\n\nPrince Harry, a military veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, established the Invictus Games in 2014 for sick and wounded service members and veterans from around the globe. More than 550 people from 17 countries are expected to participate in 12 sports during the coming week, ranging from cycling to wheelchair tennis to sitting volleyball.\n\nLondon was the setting for the inaugural event in 2015, followed by Orlando, Florida, last year.\n\nMrs. Trump\u2019s participation continues White House involvement with the games, which Harry launched during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nJill Biden, wife of then-Vice President Joe Biden, led the U.S. delegation to London as part of a military initiative undertaken with then-first lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama helped open last year\u2019s competition in Orlando.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5586292725001_5586281300001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f230238361ae698dfa367b597dbbbb6a8c21eae1/c=0-0-2189-1237/local/-/media/2017/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636417728600106755-852398122.jpg?width=2189&height=1237&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/956b81278aa67f08cd6e79724d61a97ef595a1d0/c=0-0-2189-2918/local/-/media/2017/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636417728600106755-852398122.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f230238361ae698dfa367b597dbbbb6a8c21eae1/c=0-0-2189-1237/local/-/media/2017/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636417728600106755-852398122.jpg?width=2189&height=1237&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/aerial-journalism/2017/09/23/prince-harry-melania-trump-meet-toronto-ahead-invictus-games-opening-ceremony/696494001/", "title": "Prince Harry, Melania Trump meet in Toronto ahead of Invictus Games opening ceremony", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry, Melania Trump meet in Toronto ahead of Invictus Games opening ceremony", "description": "Still no sign of girlfriend Meghan Markle, however, much to the chagrin of the media and royal watchers.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/aerial-journalism/2017/09/23/prince-harry-melania-trump-meet-toronto-ahead-invictus-games-opening-ceremony/696494001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f230238361ae698dfa367b597dbbbb6a8c21eae1/c=0-0-2189-1237/local/-/media/2017/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636417728600106755-852398122.jpg?width=2189&height=1237&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2189, "height": 1237}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Still no sign of girlfriend Meghan Markle, however, much to the chagrin of the media and royal watchers.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f230238361ae698dfa367b597dbbbb6a8c21eae1/c=0-0-2189-1237/local/-/media/2017/09/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/636417728600106755-852398122.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Prince Harry, Melania Trump meet in Toronto ahead of Invictus Games opening ceremony", "description": "Still no sign of girlfriend Meghan Markle, however, much to the chagrin of the media and royal watchers."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506096000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
