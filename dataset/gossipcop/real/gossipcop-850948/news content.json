That is crazy. That is a jewel. That is a gem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first time I was ever in this building, which I drove to from Nashville with my mom\u2026I had to sign in at the desk right there and tell them, \u2018I\u2019m here for an audition,'\u201d Miley remembered.\n\nFor four seasons, Miley played the titular character on Hannah Montana, an ordinary girl by day and a famous singer by night, from 2006 to 2011.\n\n\u201cI auditioned with a song that I had written (with a friend of my dad\u2019s) called \u2018We\u2019re Going to the Beach.\u2019 And it was about being in Nashville and leaving to go to the beach. And that (the beach) being a paradise and a home\u2026 that\u2019s the paradise to live. When you want to take a break you go to the beach and all your worries are gone,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cNow promoting this new song \u2018Malibu,\u2019 that coming from Nashville I never would have imagined living in Malibu at this time in my life or by the ocean because I grew up on a farm. And now it\u2019s just sort of ironic that these two songs are from the same person, just (almost) fifteen years later,\u201d the former Disney Channel star explained.\n\nMiley, whose last album was Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz in 2015, previously told Billboard that \u201cMalibu\u201d was partly inspired by her rekindled romance with fianc\u00e9 Liam Hemsworth, whom she lives with in Malibu, California.\n\nIt\u2019s been an exciting and busy week for Miley who released her first song after a long hiatus. She will be performing \u201cMalibu\u201d for the first time this Saturday at 102.7 KIISFM\u2019s Wango Tango, and the singer will head to Las Vegas later this month to sing the single at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nWhile her music career will continue to take her all over the world, Miley considers her animal haven in Malibu as home.\n\n\u201cI have two pigs, seven dogs, two little horses and three cats \u2026so I can\u2019t live without having land and space and animals around me,\u201d she said during her interview in Radio Disney. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like bringing Nashville out to LA so that I can be able to work and be able to be in California where I can keep making music, but also feel like I\u2019m back home too at the same time.\u201d\n\nMiley\u2019s full interview with Radio Disney airs Wednesday, May 17 at 2:00 p.m., PT/ 5:00 p.m., ET on Radio Disney and the Radio Disney app.", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1-4-324x400.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_8820417dn-696x1004.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_8820417dn.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=3BRhr1Fx9f207i", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-Lt5C7hC-NKF-K.gif", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-14-2-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MV5BNjc5M2M3YjctMzMxMy00Zjk1LTk5MDktYmQ4MmE3Mjg3YTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwNTM2Mzc@._V1_SY1000_CR0014981000_AL_-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1127467664-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/9229097be-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_8820417dn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/miley-cyrus-watched-hannah-montana-audition-tape-celebrates-release-new-single-malibu/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Watched Her Hannah Montana Audition Tape As She Celebrates the Release of Her New Single \u201cMalibu\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_8820417dn-710x1024.jpg", "secure_url": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shutterstock_8820417dn-710x1024.jpg", "width": 710, "height": 1024}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus Watched Her Hannah Montana Audition Tape As She Celebrates the Release of Her New Single \"Malibu\"", "description": "Miley Cyrus has evolved since her Hannah Montana days, but she can look back with a smile.
