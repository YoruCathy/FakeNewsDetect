Jake and Amy are getting married.\n\nTotally earning the title \u201cAmazing Human Slash Genius,\u201d Jake uses the precinct\u2019s annual Halloween heist as a means to surprise Amy with a marriage proposal. After luring her into the evidence room via an elaborate scheme involving Fake Charles and her favorite show The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Jake has his Amy recite the inscription on the winner\u2019s cummerbund, which reads, \u201cAmy Santiago, will you marry me?\u201d\n\nThen Amy turns to Jake, who\u2019s down on one knee, and the most adorable exchange precedes his popping of the question:\n\nAfter Amy says yes to Jake\u2019s proposal, Charles storms into the evidence room. He learns his best friends are engaged, grows overwhelmed and then immediately passes out (because of course he does).\n\nLater, everyone gathers at the bar to toast the engagement. Jake recalls phoning Victor to ask for Amy\u2019s hand in marriage, which instead resulted in an awkward voicemail where he proclaimed that Amy is \u201ca strong, independent woman and she don\u2019t need no man!\u201d (Suffice it to say, Jimmy Smits\u2019 inevitable return for the wedding should be a lot of fun.)\n\nThen Terry and Charles try taking credit for the proposal. Terry thinks he gave Jake the idea when he waxed poetic about mixing vanilla and blueberry yogurt back at the precinct; Charles thinks he put the idea in his head when he interrupted Jake and Amy\u2019s meet-cute back in 2009 and insisted he heard wedding bells. But as it turns out, Jake knew he was going to ask Amy to marry him for months, having come to the \u201cdope\u201d romantic epiphany when she freaked out over a random crossword typo.\n\nDetective\u2019s log:\n\n* I love how much Holt loves the annual Halloween heist at this point. Not only is he sitting at the foot of Jake and Amy\u2019s bed waiting for them to get up at 3 am to get a head start, but he interrupts their engagement celebration to make sure everyone knows that no one won. (\u201cGet over it, \u2018ya jag!\u201d)\n\n* When Jake and Holt rip open each other\u2019s button-down shirts, you actually hear the buttons falling to the floor. Even funnier, Terry yells, \u201cEverybody stop undressing! We just had harassment training!\u201d\n\n* Holt, when he finds out the corgi he\u2019s walking isn\u2019t actually his dog, exclaims, \u201cYou\u2019re not Cheddar! You\u2019re just some common bitch!\u201d\n\n* Throughout the week, pretty much everyone fed Terry GPS tracking devices, so he now has at least six of them lining his intestinal tract.\n\n* Gina isn\u2019t in the episode (Chelsea Peretti is still on maternity leave), but it\u2019s implied that the character gave birth to a healthy baby girl.\n\n* Charles thinks the phrase \u201chook, line and sinker\u201d is actually \u201chook, line and sphincter,\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s where you put the hook in when you\u2019re eeling!\u201d\n\n* While it\u2019s probably too soon to start talking wedding plans, it\u2019s safe to assume Charles is going to try and fulfill the duties of best man and bridesmaid, yes? And Nikolaj is totally going to be the flower girl boy.\n\nWere you surprised by Tuesday\u2019s B99 wedding proposal?
