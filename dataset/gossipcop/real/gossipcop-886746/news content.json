The publication, known as UK's leading gay magazine (Prince William became the first royal to grace its cover last year), recognized the late Princess for her charity work with people suffering from AIDS.\n\nIn his speech\u2014nearly two months after the 20th anniversary of his mother's death\u2014Harry remembered the famous moment when Diana shook hands with an AIDS patient in the late '80s, thus challenging stigmas against those suffering with the illness.\n\n\"In April 1987, my mother was only 25 years old,\" he began. \"She was still finding her way in public life, but already she felt a responsibility to shine her spotlight on the people and issues that were often ignored. She knew that AIDS was one of the things that many people wanted to ignore and seemed like a hopeless challenge.\"\n\nPrincess Diana meeting with AIDS patients in Brazil in 1991.

In 2006, he established Sentebale, an organization that supports children affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana, Africa. He also memorably got tested for HIV with Rihanna in Barbados to raise awareness on World AIDS Day in 2016.\n\nDecades after her passing, Diana's legacy of empathy and philanthropy live on through her children.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a12840718/prince-harry-princess-diana-legacy-award/", "title": "Prince Harry Just Accepted an Award on Princess Diana's Behalf and We're Emotional", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Prince Harry Just Accepted an Award on Princess Diana's Behalf and We're Emotional", "description": "The royal honored his late mother's charity work with AIDS patients.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a12840718/prince-harry-princess-diana-legacy-award/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-03-28 09:20:50", "published_time": "2017-10-12 09:52:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Prince Harry Accepts Princess Diana's Legacy Award - Prince Harry Honors Diana at the Attitude Awards", "description": "The royal honored his late mother's charity work with AIDS patients.", "keywords": "attitude awards, prince harry, princess diana", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.132xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest,attitude awards,prince harry,princess diana", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-12T21:52:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-prince-harry-attitude-award-index1-1507844275.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.132xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Prince Harry Just Accepted an Award on Princess Diana's Behalf and We're Emotional", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507773120.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
