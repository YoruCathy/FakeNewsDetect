Selena's death and the events that led up to it are chilling, and the latest reenactment definitely adds to the horror of it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore from Mam\u00e1sLatinas: The true motive behind Yolanda Salvidar's murder of Selena Quintanilla is still unknown\n\nIt's no surprise that the producers of the Reelz television series Murder Made Me Famous decided to tell the story of Selena's death in 1995, when she was just 23-years-old. Before J.Lo or Shakira, the bilingual Selena, who was born and raised in Texas, brought a Latina face and Spanish-language pop music to mainstream radio stations.\n\nSelena, whose star has only grown post-humously, made a huge impact on the many young girls who have held her in their hearts for years, passing that love onto their children.\n\nThe episode takes a look at Selena's killer, Yolanda Salvidar, who was at one time president of Selena's fan club and how she ended up becoming close enough to the the Quintanilla family that she was managing the fan club's finances, and eventually embezzling money from it.\n\nFrom the trial and the 1997 movie Selena which catapulted Jennifer Lopez into stardom and cemented Selena's icon status, we know that Selena's father Abraham approached Yolanda about the theft. It prompted the woman to panic and purchase a gun which she then used to kill Selena.\n\nThe Murder Made Me Famous reenactment of that confrontation between Abraham, Selena, Selena's sister Suzette and Yolanda, in which Abraham threatens to fire her and press charges, is absolutely chilling and it's truly scary to see how it all unfolded over the course of just a few days.\n\nSince the 20th anniversary of her death just two years ago, Selena has often made headlines for things like the creation of her wax figure by Madame Tussauds, a makeup line by MAC Cosmetics that was inspired by her style and her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. All of which has broadened her reach to a new, younger generation of admirers. No doubt many will tune into the Reelz program.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=550127928784997&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://cdn-ugc.mamaslatinas.com/gen/constrain/600/600/80/2017/12/07/12/d0/ze/pobpwehao8.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2019/06/28/13/97/c9/phgkxqk2041.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035453&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_wn=e1_4", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bnzfTM78T_ems.gif", "https://bcp.crwdcntrl.net/5/c=9173/b=54110645", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/full/2017/12/07/12/d0/ze/pobpwehao8.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2013/09/17/12/4t/cm/phleih6o4k1.jpg", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2617628820649&event=pagevisit&noscript=1", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/50/50/70/2018/11/30/14/2q/rh/ph3tpo8g001.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2020/04/18/10/dp/5j/ph3bwu5ts01.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2020/04/17/16/ai/kr/ph4scgli8g1.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2016/04/26/12/ca/rw/phc84wksg01.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/160/90/80/2018/08/02/13/hh/5i/phjudvrcgs1.jpg", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2617628820649&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/full/2017/12/07/12/d0/ze/pobpwehao8.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://quemas.mamaslatinas.com/entertainment/150715/the-chilling-reenactment-of-selena-quintanilla-last-days-alive-video", "title": "WATCH: The chilling reenactment of Selena Quintanilla's last days alive", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=0,maximum-scale=1.0", "google": "notranslate", "description": "The true crime story of singer Selena Quintanilla's murder will be aired on television and the re-enactment of the days before she died are scary.", "wot-verification": "f685cda662e796715172", "language": "English", "news_keywords": "selena, selena quintanilla, yolanda saldivar, reelz, murder made me famous, true crime, televison", "og": {"title": "WATCH: The chilling reenactment of Selena Quintanilla's last days alive", "type": "article", "url": "http://quemas.mamaslatinas.com/entertainment/150715/the-chilling-reenactment-of-selena-quintanilla-last-days-alive-video", "image": "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/full/2017/12/07/12/d0/ze/pobpwehao8.jpg", "description": "The true crime story of singer Selena Quintanilla's murder will be aired on television and the re-enactment of the days before she died are scary.", "site_name": "mamasLatinas.com"}, "fb": {"pages": 297154877136238}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "WATCH: The chilling reenactment of Selena Quintanilla's last days alive", "description": "The true crime story of singer Selena Quintanilla's murder will be aired on television and the re-enactment of the days before she died are scary.", "image": "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/full/2017/12/07/12/d0/ze/pobpwehao8.jpg", "site": "@MamasLatinasUSA"}, "lytics": {"tags": "celebrities,celebrity,murder,tv,tv shows,selena,selena quintanilla", "post_type": "article", "category": "News & Entertainment", "brand_safe": "true"}, "article": {"published_time": 1512672600}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://quemas.mamaslatinas.com", "summary": ""}
