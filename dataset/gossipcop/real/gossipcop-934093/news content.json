Kim and her husband Kanye West have three: North, Saint, and Chicago. Kourtney co-parents Mason, Penelope, and Reign with her ex partner Scott Disick. Rob Kardashian has a daughter, Dream, with his ex Blac Chyna. Kendall's younger sister, Kylie, welcomed her first baby (a daughter named Stormi Webster) with boyfriend Travis Scott in February. And just last month, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian welcomed her first child (also a daughter, named True) with boyfriend Tristan Thompson.\n\nIn a new interview with Elle magazine, Kendall admits that even she can barely keep up with the amount of babies joining the Kardashian-Jenner group. \"[My family is] forever growing,\u201d Jenner said while chatting with Lana Del Rey for the magazine. \u201cEvery time I think it\u2019s eased up, someone\u2019s popping out a baby.\u201d\n\nKendall specifically talked about Kylie's birth during her interview. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a bit weird that your little sister is having a baby before you,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to happen like this. But it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Not only has Kylie taken to motherhood well, Kendall says it's also made her a more loving sister in general. \u201cIt\u2019s brought us closer together. We\u2019ve always been very close, but we would butt heads all the time. This has made her a bit more loving toward me,\" she said.\n\nKendall and Kylie are often grouped together as the two youngest siblings\u2014they have a joint clothing line, after all\u2014but that doesn't mean they don't fight. One such spat, Kendall says, was over their mutual celebrity friend Hailey Baldwin. \u201cShe was actually best friends with Kylie, and I was good friends with her cousin Ireland [Alec Baldwin\u2019s daughter],\u201d Kendall says. \u201cHailey lived in New York, and whenever we were there, we would hang out with her.\u201d\n\nThe two models soon became close during New York Fashion Week, as one does\u2014which briefly irked Kylie. \u201cFrom then on, [Hailey] was my homie,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cAt first, Kylie was mad; I had to bring them back together and be like, \u2018No, it\u2019s okay, guys.\u2019 But it\u2019s all good; that\u2019s our love story.\u201d Love story, indeed.\n\nFor more of Kendall's interview with Del Rey, click here.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nKendall and Kylie Jenner's Day Off Involved Lots of Staring at Each Other in Silence", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1525899839/glamour_black-panther-s-letitia-wright-shows-us-the-last-thing-on-her-phone.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Minton", "Melissa Minto"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-thinks-its-weird-kylie-jenner-had-baby-before-her", "title": "Kendall Jenner Thinks It's 'a Bit Weird' That Kylie Had a Baby Before Her", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Melissa Minton", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "In a new interview, Kendall Jenner discusses how she feels about younger sister Kylie Jenner giving birth and how motherhood has changed their relationship.", "id": "5af4533e295117594719a07d", "keywords": "celebrity gossip,snd,kylie jenner,kendall jenner,stormi webster,noriver", "news_keywords": "celebrity gossip,snd,kylie jenner,kendall jenner,stormi webster,noriver", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5af4533e295117594719a07d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In a new interview, Kendall Jenner discusses how she feels about younger sister Kylie Jenner giving birth and how motherhood has changed their relationship.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "'I didn\u2019t expect it to happen like this.'", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Kendall Jenner Thinks It's 'a Bit Weird' That Kylie Had a Baby Before Her", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-thinks-its-weird-kylie-jenner-had-baby-before-her"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "'I didn\u2019t expect it to happen like this.'", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Kendall Jenner Thinks It's 'a Bit Weird' That Kylie Had a Baby Before Her"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
