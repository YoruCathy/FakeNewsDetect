Kelly Ripa celebrated two big anniversaries on Tuesday, May 1. First off, she rang in 22 years of marriage with her husband, Mark Consuelos. On top of that, the day marked one year of her hosting Live With Kelly with co-host Ryan Seacrest!\n\nThe TV personality took to Instagram to give sweet shout-outs to both Mark and Ryan. For Mark, she posted a sweet video collage featuring a bunch of cute photos of the two. \u201cFeliz Aniversario lover! 22 years. You\u2019re a human roller coaster that luckily I\u2019m tall enough to ride. @instasuelos ?? ??\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f??,\u201d she captioned the super adorable clip.\n\nMark followed up with a sweet message for his lady. \u201c5-1-96\u2026happy 22nd anniversary Boo\u2026 seems like yesterday to me\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s feels a lot longer to you\u2026(honeymoon photo Capri, Italy\u2026 we\u2019re still banned from that hotel\u2026 it was worth it),\u201d he captioned some throwback photos of the couple.\n\nThe duo previously wed in Las Vegas back in 1996 and are now parents to son Michael, 20, daughter Lola, 16, and son Joaquin, 15. Kelly, 47, previously revealed that Mark \u201cis the person I was meant to be with forever.\u201d She gushed, \u201cWe really do have quite an allegiance to one another. No matter what, we support each other in everything we do.\u201d\n\nKelly also had a sweet message for Ryan, who joined her on the morning talk show after her former co-host Michael Strahan abruptly left her. \u201cProving time flies when you\u2019re having fun, a year goes by in the blink of an eye! Thank you @ryanseacrest you are the cohost jackpot!!! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u201d she wrote alongside a series of hilarious photos of the two.\n\nAnd Ryan followed up with a sweet message as well! \u201cHaving the best time on this show \u2014 thank you @kellyripa, @gelmanlive, our producers, and viewers for welcoming me into the fam. Happy one year to us,\u201d he wrote with a gallery of photos of the two.\n\nDespite rumors that the two don\u2019t get along behind the scenes, Kelly and Ryan actually have a great relationship. \u201cThey get along famously,\u201d a source previously told E! News of the pair. \u201cRyan and Kelly have the same work ethic and values. That\u2019s why it works so well.\u201d A source also told Closer Weekly exclusively that \u201cthey are very in sync with each other.\u201d The insider added, \u201cWith Ryan, Kelly feels like she\u2019s met her match.
