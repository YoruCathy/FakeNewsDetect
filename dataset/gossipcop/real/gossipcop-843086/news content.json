But a lesser-known Davis-Crawford battle followed\u2014on the set of another Bob Aldrich\u2013directed psycho-thriller, *Hush. . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte.\u201d And on Sunday night\u2019s episode of Feud, \u201cAbandoned,\u201d Ryan Murphy revealed how Davis masterminded her own sadistic revenge on her once-again co-star.\n\nUnderstandably, the actresses were reluctant to re-team given their history. Before signing onto the film, Crawford demanded her name be billed first; to get Davis on board, Aldrich made a series of sizable concessions including a $200,000 paycheck\u2014the same fee Aldrich was receiving\u2014and his word that Davis would be an associate producer on the picture. However, during pre-production, Davis felt Aldrich was ignoring her input and fired off a firmly worded eight-page letter threatening to quit.\n\n\u201cYou do not function well with someone of my type,\u201d Davis wrote Aldrich, according to Shaun Considine\u2019s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud\u2014an absolute must-read for fans of the FX series. \u201cThat was obvious throughout the filming of Baby Jane\u2014and the suicidal desire this put me into many times, was almost more than I was able to bear. . . I do not wear well with tricks designed to make me do what someone else decides I will do.\u201d\n\nShe ended by suggesting Aldrich \u201cre-cast and pay me off. It will be cheaper in the long run.\u201d\n\nThis maneuver explains how Davis found herself sitting at Aldrich\u2019s side throughout filming, why Aldrich obliged Davis\u2019s creative input, and how Davis secured the leverage to properly torture Crawford.\n\nAlthough certain moments in \u201cAbandoned\u201d feel exaggerated for dramatic effect\u2014like Crawford being made to wait for her hotel room, and then being stuck in a room next to the garbage disposal\u2014the episode\u2019s writers actually skimped on the insane details of what actually happened.\n\nFor example, according to Shaun Considine\u2019s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud, Crawford arrived at the Baton Rouge airport with a full entourage\u2014including her hairdresser, makeup artist, and enough baggage to . . . well, let Davis explain:\n\n\u201cFor a goddamn week in Baton Rouge, she brought twenty pieces of luggage. It was a black-and-white movie but she had color-coordinated outfits for the daytime scenes, and for the night shots all of her evening dresses were chiffon, which meant that the wardrobe lady had to spend hours ironing them in the one-hundred-degree weather.\u201d\n\nWhen Crawford arrived to set the fourth day of filming, Davis had already tactically befriended the local press and crew\u2014the latter of whom she would eat lunch with. George Cukor later reflected on Davis\u2019s stone-cold set strategy: \u201cShe wanted to make a basket case out of Joan, and she almost succeeded.\u201d\n\nTo further chip away at Crawford\u2019s ego, Davis also coordinated group outings, cast and crew dinners, and other after-hours activities, inviting everyone except Joan. \u201cDavis [also] made sure that everyone, including members of the press and distinguished visitors to the set, knew that Joan was really 60 years old,\u201d authors Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoell write in Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography, before revealing another Davis tactic. \u201cShe would also stand next to director Aldrich while he was filming Joan\u2019s scenes and make loud, negative comments.\u201d\n\nWhen Crawford woke up from a nap on set one day to discover that the entire production had left the location without her, \u201cJoan was convinced that Davis was behind it, and furthermore that Davis was manipulating Aldrich behind the scenes,\u201d wrote Quirk and Schoell. \u201c\u2018She\u2019s practically directing the picture for him right in front of me,\u2019\u201d she complained. \u201c\u2018So God knows what else she\u2019s up to behind my back. I might wind up on the cutting-room floor.\u2019\u201d\n\nFeeling ostracized, Crawford retreated further from the group\u2014spending the majority of her time either avoiding the heat (and crew) in her trailer, or enforcing her compulsive routine on her entourage members including makeup artist Monte Westmore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d wake her up at six,\u201d Westmore told Considine of his time with Crawford in Baton Rouge. \u201cShe\u2019d exercise a little bit while I set out her makeup. Then she\u2019d make breakfast, which I had to eat.\u201d Crawford applied her makeup herself, and tasked Westmore with the enormous task of finding the perfect false eyelashes. \u201cThey always had to be just right,\u201d explained Westmore. \u201cTrimmed perfectly in line, then curled in a circle. I would layout six pair for her on the table. She would then inspect them. . . We went through a gross and a half of eyelashes per picture.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019s makeup artist, Bob Schiffer, concurred\u2014adding that Crawford\u2019s diva behavior didn\u2019t endear her to the crew. \u201cCrawford wouldn\u2019t listen to you,\u201d said Schiffer, according to Considine. \u201cAll you did was work on the eyelashes, then hold the mirror for her between setups. It was a servitude position, and Joan made the slaves look like Boy Scouts.\u201d\n\n(In her defense, Davis also liked to do her own makeup: \u201cOn Charlotte I had my own makeup concept for Bette,\u201d adds Schiffer in The Divine Feud, \u201cwhich lasted about five minutes. She would say to me, \u2018Don\u2019t fuck with my face.\u2019\u201d)\n\nDespite her own demands, Davis was quick to make cracks about Crawford\u2019s high-maintenance upkeep and took delight in pointing out the \u201cmounds of hairpieces\u201d Crawford brought with her to cover her thinning hair.\n\n\u201cMaggie Donovan, who had been my hairdresser for years, said to me one day, \u2018We\u2019re up to our asses in Crawford\u2019s hairpieces,\u2019\u201d said Davis, per Considine.\n\nLater in production, when Aldrich refused to expand her part and take her character suggestions, Crawford\u2014left with no way to legally quit the picture\u2014took herself to Cedar Sinai hospital. And after several hospital stays, terse legal meetings, and unsuccessful talks with Crawford, Aldrich succeeded in getting the studio to agree to replace her.\n\n\u201cFox had closed down my last movie [Something\u2019s Got to Give],\u201d George Cukor later explained to Considine, \u201cbecause no actress wanted to take over for [Marilyn] Monroe. The picture was covered [by insurance], and I think Joan figured they would do the same thing for her.\u201d\n\nDavis, knowing that Crawford being replaced would be a masterful, final blow to the ego, phoned her friend Olivia de Havilland. When her fellow Oscar winner balked at the part, Davis sent Aldrich to meet her in person in Switzerland and convince her to take the role. When the deal was inked, in one more nasty maneuver, Davis called her press agent to leak the story.\n\n\u201cI heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed,\u201d said Joan, having gotten a Davis-administered dose of her own medicine. \u201cI wept for nine hours.\u201d Having recovered enough to roll phone calls to press, Crawford told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cAldrich knew where to long distance me all over the world when he needed me, but he made no effort to reach me here that he had signed Olivia. He let me hear it for the first time in a radio release . . . and, frankly, I think it stinks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still get chills when I think of the treachery that Miss Davis indulged in on that movie,\u201d Crawford told Considine, \u201cbut I refused to ever let anger or hate enter my heart.\u201d\n\nShe may not have let hate in her heart. But even while in the hospital, the movie star couldn\u2019t resist sniping at de Havilland during these interviews, according to Ed Sikov\u2019s Dark Victory: The Life of Bette Davis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad for Olivia,\u201d Crawford told press, from inside her oxygen tent. \u201cShe needed the part.\u201d", "images":
