I\u2019ve made plenty of mistakes in my past,\u201d Lopez previously told Good Morning America. \u201cWe\u2019re mature now. We\u2019re grown ups, and we\u2019re going to take our time and we\u2019re going to do things at our own pace.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, August 1, Rodriguez touched on how age has played into the dynamics of their relationship in a good way. \u201cTo be honest, if this happened when we were in our twenties, it would have never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just too much craziness. I wasn\u2019t mature enough. You know, boys, we got to get our dumbness out of the way.\u201d\n\nThey Share Similar Life Stages\n\nRodriguez also explained how they bond over the parallels in their lives. \u201cWe\u2019re in our forties. We\u2019re both from New York,\u201d he mused on the Today show. \u201cWe both come from Latino backgrounds. We both have two kids. I think we\u2019ve both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other\u2014both the good and the challenges.\u201d\n\nLopez echoed her boyfriend\u2019s notes about their similar life stages in an interview with Cubby and Carolina in the Morning this week. \u201cI think we\u2019re both in a good place in our lives,\u201d she said on the radio program. \u201cNow at this point in our lives where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we\u2019re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other. It\u2019s like, where I need help, he\u2019s really strong and where he needs help I\u2019m really strong.\u201d\n\nThey Sharpen Each Other\n\nWith dynamic and thriving careers, both Lopez and Rodriguez continue to look for the next derivative of personal and professional growth. \u201cI\u2019m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time, I don\u2019t know, maybe ever,\u201d she previously told Hola! \u201cAnd not that I didn\u2019t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I\u2019ve been where I feel like we really make each other better. We complement each other, and there\u2019s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there\u2019s a different selflessness in the love that\u2019s beautiful and different. And healthy!\u201d\n\nTheir Modern Family Loves Each Other\n\n\u201cHonestly it couldn\u2019t be better,\u201d Lopez added to Cubby and Carolina this week. \u201cThe four of them are amazingly special kids. I mean, of course I\u2019m going to say that because I\u2019m their mom, but they are and they\u2019re sweet and they\u2019re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way. And they love each other, they get along so good.\u201d\n\nTheir Love Story Was Meant to Be\n\nIn a detailed Vanity Fair piece, Lopez went into detail about the beginning stages of their romance. In fact, it almost didn\u2019t happen. \u201cIt was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI almost yelled out \u2018Alex,\u2019 but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that\u2026 I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say \u2018Hey.\u2019\u201d\n\nTheir first date was equally surprising. \u201cHe was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!\u201d she recalled to Vanity Fair. \u201cI think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I\u2019m not. I just listen. So he\u2019s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\u2019t normally talk about on a first date. I don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date.\u201d\n\nSecure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot\u2019s Style Quiz, here.", "images": ["https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cec381d2-93e9-4201-9271-30f51f4fec94~rs_200.h", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/authors/elee-9.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-the-knot-news-logo@2x.png", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brittany-Tyler-Couch-Story-Lead-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Questions-About-How-Coronavirus-Could-Affect-Your-Wedding_-Read-This-LEAD-shutterstock-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2127-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89960078_664744544273850_2656838980867194880_o-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1554396644-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lopez-Rodriguez-1500.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lopez-Rodriguez-1500.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Is The Senior News Editor At The Knot.
