Bloom celebrated his birthday with his father Colin at his side, who couldn\u2019t have looked more proud, cheering his son from the sidelines.\n\nHappy birthday Orlando!", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1-4-324x400.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=3BRhr1Fx9f207i", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-Lt5C7hC-NKF-K.gif", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original-696x1039.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-14-2-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MV5BNjc5M2M3YjctMzMxMy00Zjk1LTk5MDktYmQ4MmE3Mjg3YTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwNTM2Mzc@._V1_SY1000_CR0014981000_AL_-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1127467664-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/9229097be-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/orlando-bloom-celebrates-birthday-leonardo-dicaprio-race-cars-morocco/", "title": "Orlando Bloom Celebrates Birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio and Race Cars in Morocco", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original-686x1024.jpg", "secure_url": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original-686x1024.jpg", "width": 686, "height": 1024}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Orlando Bloom Celebrates Birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio and Race Cars in Morocco", "description": "Orlando Bloom celebrated his 41st birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio by attending the third race of the Formula E season in Marrakesh, Morocco on Friday.
