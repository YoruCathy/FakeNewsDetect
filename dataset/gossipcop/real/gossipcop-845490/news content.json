At the time, the singer also admitted to having smoked marijuana and taken prescription medication.\n\nThat arrest came amidst a spate of legal trouble for the young Biebs, who also faced charges that year for egging a neighbor's home in Calabasas, California, and dangerous driving during a date with Selena Gomez, in his hometown in Canada.\n\n\n\nNEWS: Justin Bieber Gets Giant Eagle Tattoo On His Stomach\n\nThankfully, Bieber seems to have kept himself largely out of trouble and on the right side of the law more recently.
