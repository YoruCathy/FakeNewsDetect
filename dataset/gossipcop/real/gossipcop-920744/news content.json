Or perhaps, more precisely, what Titanic might've panned out like were Nicholas Sparks ever to scribe a novelization in a similar vein.\n\nThe film, based on the true tale of real-life ocean enthusiasts Tami Oldham and Richard Sharp in 1983, chronicles the duo's harrowing brush with Hurricane Raymond, one of the most disastrous hurricanes ever to be documented.\n\nIn the trailer, below, all seems well for the seafaring lovers Tami (Woodley) and Richard (Claflin), who embark on a 1,000-mile cruise to Tahiti until tragedy strikes when the couple find themselves at the core of a category 5 tempest, resulting in life-threatening injuries for Richard and leaving Tami to salvage the remains of their boat to navigate them to safety.\n\nThe upcoming feature film will be the 26-year-old actress' first big-screen break in two years since her last appearances in 2016's Snowden and The Divergent Series: Allegiant.\n\nAdrift arrives in theaters June 1.", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/04/popcrush-logo-carbon-high-rez-V2.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/03/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin.png?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/03/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin.png?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paris Close"], "canonical_link": "https://popcrush.com/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin/", "title": "Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin Are Lovers Lost at Sea in \u2018Adrift\u2019 Trailer", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "popcrush", "description": "Shailene Woodley's new movie looks insane.", "keywords": "shailene woodley, sam claflin, adrift movie trailer, adrift movie release date,", "fb": {"app_id": 182203965156817, "admins": 9806076, "pages": 109218389152020}, "og": {"title": "Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin Are Lovers Lost at Sea in 'Adrift' Trailer", "description": "Shailene Woodley's new movie looks insane.", "url": "https://popcrush.com/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin/", "site_name": "PopCrush", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/03/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin.png?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@popcrush"}, "sailthru.description": "Shailene Woodley's new movie looks insane.", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-15 22:10:36", "sailthru.title": "Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin Are Lovers Lost at Sea in \u2018Adrift\u2019 Trailer", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-popcrush, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, shailene-woodley, movie-news, news", "sailthru.author": "parisclose", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/03/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/03/adrift-trailer-shailene-woodley-sam-claflin.png", "google-site-verification": "GeG6ZXKpr_WSX9JtX0VKaUqh7SznDm4ZtjJGEZulM7U", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521123036.0, "source": "http://popcrush.com", "summary": ""}
