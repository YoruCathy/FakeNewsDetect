Aside from providing fans with 25 new tracks, the album also confirmed rumors that the rapper has a son. Now, Twitter is trying to figure out Drake\u2019s son\u2019s full name (because of course), and you might want to sit down for this current theory.\n\nTo recap, fans first began speculating that Drake had a child after Pusha T released the diss track, \u201cThe Story of Adidon.\u201d In the song, Pusha raps about Drake, singing: \u201cYou are hiding a child/Let that boy come home.\u201d And two songs from Scorpion appear to address the situation. In \u201cEmotionless,\u201d Drake declares, \u201cI wasn\u2019t hidin\u2019 my kid from the world/I was hidin\u2019 the world from my kid.\u201d In \u201cMarch 14,\u201d he made his confirmation even clearer with a coy reference to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBillie Jean,\u201d singing, \u201cShe\u2019s not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.\u201d\n\nFans immediately began digging, and many are confident that Drake\u2019s son\u2019s first name is Adonis, based on a now-deleted Instagram pic from the child\u2019s mother, Sophie Brussaux.\n\nHowever, others have a different theory.\n\nSome Twitter users suggested the child\u2019s name has been hiding in plain sight the whole time. In his song \u201cGod\u2019s Plan,\u201d (which dropped as a single earlier this year), Drake raps, \u201cI only love my bed and my momma, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nThis has lead some to speculate that Drake\u2019s son is named \u201cMahbed,\u201d which sounds exactly like, \u201cmy bed\u201d and means \u201cChosen One\u201d in Romanian. MINDS: BLOWN.\n\nI only love \u201cMy Bed\u201d and my momma I\u2019m sorry...\n\n\n\nDrake\u2019s son\u2019s name is Mahbed = Romanian for \u201cchosen one\u201d\n\n\n\nHe been telling the truth\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 \u2014 KOTI\ud83d\udc9c\u2728\ud83d\udc41 (@kingsayg) July 1, 2018\n\nDrake\u2019s son name is MAHBED so when he said \u201cI only love my bed and my mama i\u2019m sorry\u201d he was really saying ... \u201cI only love MAHBED and my mama i\u2019m sorry\u201d Goodnight, hope u get some sleep (: \u2014 dabrat\ud83e\udd40 (@BriYonJ) July 2, 2018\n\nOthers proposed that the baby\u2019s middle name is Mahbed while his first name is Adonis.\n\nDrake\u2019s son\u2019s name is Adonis Mahbed so in God\u2019s Plan when he said \u201cI only love my bed & my momma\u201d he actually said \u201cI only love Mahbed & my momma\u201d I\u2019m shook bye \u2014 \u24e0\u24e4\u24d4\u24d4\u24dd \u24df\u24de\u24d8\u2b50\ufe0f (@kayraddddd) July 2, 2018\n\nI was today years old when I figured out that Drake\u2019s son\u2019s name is Adonis Mahbed Graham so when he says \u201cI only love Mahbed and mama I\u2019m sorry\u201d he\u2019s talking about his son not a bed. pic.twitter.com/JfcnJSbLUN \u2014 RogueTarzan (@Jorge_Karatekid) July 2, 2018\n\nReading that both, Drake\u2019s son\u2019s name is \u201cAdonis Mahbed Graham\u201d & he said \u201cI only love my bed (mahbed) and my mama\u201d is honestly the reason I can\u2019t sleep right now. I\u2019m shook \u2014 R&B Kenny \ud83c\udfc1 (@kennygotsoul) July 2, 2018\n\nDrake has yet to comment on any of this, and since it seems he (understandably) wants to protect his son\u2019t privacy at this time, we don\u2019t expect him to confirm his son\u2019s name any time soon. We\u2019ll just busy ourselves with listening to Scorpion on repeat instead.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072538/avatar-f-150x150.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F02071034%2Fdrake-son-name-e1530540687179.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F02071034%2Fdrake-son-name-e1530540687179.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Sheffer"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/drakes-son-name-fan-theory/", "title": "This fan theory about Drake's son's name will blow your mind", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "drake,drake baby,drake music,music,news,Scorpion,TRENDING,trending news,Entertainment,Music", "news_keywords": "drake,drake baby,drake music,music,news,Scorpion,TRENDING,trending news,Entertainment,Music", "description": "Drake revealed he has a son in his new album, \"Scorpion.\" But what is Drake's son's name?
