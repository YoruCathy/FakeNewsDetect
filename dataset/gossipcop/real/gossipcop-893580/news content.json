In fact, in a video post dedicated to the King of Pop\u2019s third child (whose real name is Prince Michael Jackson II), Joe Jackson revealed that the 15-year-old is the most like MJ.\n\nRelated: Paris Spotted Chatting Up Australian Hottie Tyler Green\n\nAlongside the rare video upload (above), the Jackson patriarch wrote:\n\n\u201cTo my grandson Blanket. You are like your father in so many ways, and you remind me most of him. Enjoy life, see lots of good movies, stay healthy and remember, I do love you!\u201d\n\nThe industry vet expressed a similar sentiment in his rambling video, as he elaborated as to why the Thriller\u2018s singer \u201ctried to disguise [him] as much as possible.\u201d Although, the 89-year-old does seem a bit confused as he urged Blanket to stay off \u201cbikes\u201d and to tell his \u201cbrothers\u201d he said \u201chello.\u201d\n\nFor starters, Blanket has a brother (Prince Jackson) and a sister (Paris Jackson). Not to mention, it was 20-year-old Prince who ended up in the hospital after a motorcycle accident. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a grandparent has confused facts regarding their grandkids.\n\nNonetheless, Joe did leave Blanket with some words of support, as he concluded:\n\n\u201cBe like me: Be tough, be tough in a good way and you\u2019ll live a long time. Above all, I love you all. Take care man, be good and I see you next time I come to LA, OK? Adios.\u201d\n\nThe controversial talent manager also took to Twitter to share a sweet pic of himself and Blanket (below).\n\nWow, Blanket has really grown up!!\n\nWhile we\u2019re not sure what inspired Joe to reach out to the teenager, we\u2019re glad to see that he\u2019s making an effort.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20118%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20111%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20244%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2094%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20112%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20329%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-hilton-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20225%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20319%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_inBTaqkNjQ/hqdefault.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20102%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20538%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20141%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20275%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20163%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20377%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2083%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20101%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20311%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20124%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20410%22%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_inBTaqkNjQ/hqdefault.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/joe-jackson-compares-grandson-blanket-to-son-michael-jackson-youtube-video/", "title": "Joe Jackson Reveals Grandson Blanket Is Like The Late Michael Jackson \u2018In So Many Ways\u2019!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "8jhNuv6mCy23T6U62W5nXupmY4X1fumTlO3sRfrF0Oc", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Joe Jackson Reveals Grandson Blanket Is Like The Late Michael Jackson 'In So Many Ways'! - Perez Hilton", "description": "Reaching out.
