The Demogorgon of the first chapter makes way for the \"Shadow Monster\" born in Will's \"PTSD-like visions of\" his season one experience. Speaking about the new run of episodes, co-creator Ross Duffer of the Duffer Brothers previously said: \u201cIt\u2019s all connected to this singular threat, which is tied into this shape that Will sees in the sky.\"\n\nDownload the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nIn the final Stranger Things 2 trailer the stakes keep rising, as the survivors of season one face the horrors from their nightmares as they creep into reality. Eleven has no choice but to return.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers revealed that the forthcoming season acts as a \"movie sequel\" to the first instalment with the marketing campaign branding the new episodes as Stranger Things 2, as opposed to Stranger Things season 2.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
