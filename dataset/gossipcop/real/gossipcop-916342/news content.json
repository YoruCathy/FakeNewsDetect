Prosecutors in New York, Los Angeles and London are pursuing possible criminal cases against him. A lawsuit filed last month by Mr. Schneiderman will continue. Mr. Weinstein also faces additional civil suits, including one filed by the British actress Kadian Noble, who is suing him for sex trafficking.\n\nBut the bankruptcy filing does halt an array of lawsuits against the company, including those filed by women who contend that the studio facilitated misconduct by Mr. Weinstein. Those women will now have to line up behind the studio\u2019s secured creditors \u2014 who themselves are likely to be paid pennies on the dollar, according to bankruptcy lawyers.\n\nThe upshot is that women alleging abuse may now have a harder time recovering damages.\n\nThe filing, which was expected, ended a chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat.\n\nIn the fall, after The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations of sexual harassment and rape, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s younger brother and partner in the studio, Bob Weinstein, unsuccessfully scrambled to line up bridge loans to keep the company operating. He then sold \u201cPaddington 2\u201d rights to Warner Bros., which bought time but resulted in a lawsuit.\n\nBy early February, to the disbelief of many in the film industry, it seemed as if the Weinstein Company had found a way forward. A group of investors, including the billionaire Ron Burkle and Lantern Capital, had made an offer to buy most of the studio\u2019s assets, which include the TV series \u201cProject Runway\u201d and the rights to \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and about 275 other films.\n\nThe investor group, managed by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, had offered to pay off what it believed was the Weinstein Company\u2019s debt \u2014 about $225 million. In return, it would receive most of the studio\u2019s assets, which Ms. Contreras-Sweet planned to use to start a new, female-led film company.\n\nBut then Mr. Schneiderman threw the brakes on a sale, filing a lawsuit alleging that the studio and the Weinstein brothers had violated various state and city laws. He also said the proposed sale to Ms. Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group was unacceptable because it did not adequately compensate victims, protect employees and ensure that those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct would not be rewarded.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brooks Barnes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-03-20T03:44:59.000Z", "modified": "2018-03-20T03:44:59.000Z", "section": "Business", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/brooks-barnes", "tag": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005808048, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1845af8a-a501-59f3-aeae-1cef61f50ddf", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/5e82daef8eb14c889a0bb9d4b45c8703", "description": "As part of the filing, the studio said it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\u201d from nondisclosure agreements.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Brooks Barnes", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Bankruptcy,Harvey Weinstein,MeToo Movement,Sexual harassment,Weinstein,Mergers and Acquisitions", "pdate": 20180319, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "type": "article", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "The Weinstein Company had been struggling after a co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, was fired as chief executive in October after women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades."}, "description": "As part of the filing, the studio said it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\u201d from nondisclosure agreements."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements", "description": "As part of the filing, the studio said it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\u201d from nondisclosure agreements.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "The Weinstein Company had been struggling after a co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, was fired as chief executive in October after women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1845af8a-a501-59f3-aeae-1cef61f50ddf"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "business", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1845af8a-a501-59f3-aeae-1cef61f50ddf", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521388800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
