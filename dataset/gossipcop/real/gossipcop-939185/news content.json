In 2007, she and her family began starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Its success led to the creation of spin-offs including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami [2] and Kourtney and Kim Take New York.[3]\n\nWith sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9, Kourtney is involved in the retail and fashion industries. They have launched several clothing collections and fragrances, and additionally released the book Kardashian Konfidential in 2010. Kourtney launched her own website called 'Poosh' in early 2019.\n\nKourtney and her siblings are popular on social media and endorse products such as waist slimming pants, beauty products, Coca-Cola and prescription drugs, for which they are paid (as of 2016) between $75,000 and $300,000 per post on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, as per CBC Marketplace.[4][5][6]\n\nEarly life\n\nKourtney Mary Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California on April 18, 1979 to Robert and Kris.[7] She has two younger sisters, Kim and Khlo\u00e9, and a younger brother, Robert (Rob).[8] In 1991, her parents got divorced and her mother married Bruce Jenner, a 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner (Jenner later changed her name to Caitlyn[a]) in 1991.[10] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained stepbrothers Burton \"Burt\", Brandon, and Brody; stepsister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.[11]\n\nShe attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles. Following graduation, she moved to Dallas, Texas, to attend Southern Methodist University for two years. Kourtney then lived in Tucson, Arizona, where she graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts and a minor in Spanish. Her classmates included Nicole Richie and Luke Walton.[12] In 1994, her father garnered public attention as an additional defense lawyer for football player O.J. Simpson during his murder trial.\n\nCareer\n\nKourtney first became known to reality-television audiences on the 2005 series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, on which she earned money for charity. In February 2007, a sex tape made by her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J in 2003, Kim Kardashian, Superstar, was leaked, which largely contributed to her rise to prominence.[13][14] Later that year, Kourtney, in addition to her mother Kris; her stepfather Bruce (now known as Caitlyn);[15] her siblings Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[16] The series proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and lead to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami, Khlo\u00e9 & Lamar, and Kourtney and Kim Take New York .[17]\n\nKourtney and her mother opened children's clothing boutiques called Smooch in the Los Angeles area and New York City; the boutiques carry the brand Crib Rock Couture. With sisters Kim and Khloe, Kardashian co-owns and operates D-A-S-H, a clothing boutique in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and a pop-up store in the Hamptons.[12]\n\nIn the spring of 2010, Kourtney and her sisters released a clothing line for Bebe.[18][19][20] In August 2010, Kourtney announced that she and her sisters were working on another clothing line called K-Dash, sold on QVC.[21] Kardashian and her sisters created a sunless tanner called Kardashian Glamour Tan in 2010.[22] Kardashian wrote the book Kardashian Konfidential with her sisters Khloe and Kim; it was released in November 2010.[23]\n\nKourtney made her acting debut with a guest appearance on the ABC soap One Life to Live on March 28, 2011, appearing as attorney Kassandra Kavanaugh.[24] Kardashian, who had grown up watching the soap opera and described her appearance as the realization of a \"lifelong dream,\" had reservations about her acting debut, stating: \"I'd thought I'd only have two lines. But my script is so long... I'm not an actress.\"[25][26] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[27] In September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner, Kourtney's boyfriend at the time, Scott Disick, and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[28][29]\n\nKourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Kim were spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss. In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[30] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs, from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[31]\n\nKardashian also represents the skincare line PerfectSkin with her sisters, which was developed by Dr. Ron DiSalvo for Perfect Science Labs.[32] The three sisters also released a 20-piece collection of jewelry line for the company Virgins, Saints, and Angels, in March 2010. The jewelry is reflective of their partial Armenian background.[33] In 2017, Kourtney launched her first solo fashion line as part of a collaboration with the site PrettyLittleThing. According to the website, the 32-piece line was inspired by Studio 54, classical Hollywood cinema, and the 1970s.[34]\n\nOn March 5, 2019, Kardashian released her new lifestyle website named Poosh.[35]\n\nPersonal life\n\nKardashian and Scott Disick in 2010\n\nKardashian dated Scott Disick from 2006 to 2015.[36] The two met at mutual friend Joe Francis's house party in Mexico.[37] Kardashian has three children with Disick: son Mason Dash (born December 14, 2009), daughter Penelope Scotland (born July 8, 2012),[38][39] and son Reign Aston (born December 14, 2014).[40]\n\nKardashian and Disick's on-again, off-again relationship has been shown on Keeping Up With the Kardashians and its numerous spin offs. Kardashian's pregnancies and the births of all three of her children have also been featured on the show.[41][42]\n\nIn early 2010, the couple temporarily moved to Miami with their son and Kourtney's sister Kim. During this time, Kourtney believed Disick had an alcohol problem. After regularly attending therapy and temporarily giving up alcohol, Disick and Kourtney reconciled and they continued their relationship in mid-2010.[43]\n\nIn 2011, during the final episode in the first season of Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Disick purchased an engagement ring and planned to propose to Kourtney during an evening meal in New York City. However, when Disick asked Kourtney's opinion on marriage, she responded with, \"If things are so good now...why would we want to change that?\", so he did not propose.[44]\n\nIn October 2019 Kardashian and her children were baptized in an Armenian Apostolic ceremony at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat, Armenia. During the ceremony, she was christened with the Armenian name Gayane.[45]\n\nFilmography\n\nAs television actress\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 One Life to Live Kassandra Kavanaugh TV series (1 episode)\n\nAs herself on reality TV\n\nBooks\n\nNotes\n\n^ [9] Jenner changed her name due to gender transition in 2015.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Kourtney_Kardashian_2_2009.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Kourtney_Kardashian_2_2009.jpg/220px-Kourtney_Kardashian_2_2009.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Scott_Disick_%26_Kourtney_Kardashian_2010.jpg/200px-Scott_Disick_%26_Kourtney_Kardashian_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Kourtney_Kardashian_2_2009.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourtney_Kardashian", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.27", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Kourtney_Kardashian_2_2009.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
