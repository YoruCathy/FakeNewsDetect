Now attendees of the 2018 Grammy Awards are mobilizing to wear white roses to the ceremony as a way of recognizing the ongoing cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse occurring across several industries, including entertainment.\n\nIndustry marketer Meg Harkins and promoter Karen Rait came up with the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, at a dinner where they and other music industry insiders brainstormed ways to ensure that the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements were acknowledged at the Grammys, just like they were at the Golden Globes.\n\nAfter they had chosen the white rose \u2014 which they settled on as a symbol of peace, hope, and resistance \u2014 they began to spread the word by way of a mass email from Atlantic Records chair Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who\u2019ve confirmed they\u2019ll be wearing white roses to the Grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rita Ora, among others on a list that reportedly numbers in the hundreds.\n\nWhen informed of the movement during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grammys host James Corden immediately voiced support and said he\u2019d be wearing one as well.\n\nHarkins and Rait told Billboard they were working to coordinate their messaging with the leaders of the Time\u2019s Up campaign, which has been generally viewed as a leveling-up of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time\u2019s Up also doubles as a legal fund for anyone fighting sexual harassment.\n\nThe push to extend the conversation around the movement into the Grammys is significant; so far, despite prominent actors like Casey Affleck and James Franco coming under scrutiny in the wake of a wave of sexual assault allegations throughout Hollywood, there\u2019s been little similar pushback against prominent members of the music industry.\n\nA few, like mogul Russell Simmons, have experienced repercussions after allegations against them. But others, like musicians R. Kelly and Chris Brown, continue to maintain successful careers despite ongoing controversy surrounding accusations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against them.\n\nThe organizers of the plan to wear white roses to the Grammys are all too aware of this dichotomy. \u201cWe have not had the tsunami [in the music industry] that politics and Hollywood has had,\u201d Harkins told the Associated Press on Wednesday, \u201cbut we are still women.\u201d\n\nThe effort to extend #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up into the music industry comes at a moment when the latter campaign is already drawing backlash for expanding its reach outside of Hollywood, even though it\u2019s not even a month old; the campaign has been criticized for not remaining narrowly focused on Hollywood reform. But the fact that in just a few days, hundreds of women in the music industry have vowed to show solidarity with Time\u2019s Up at the Grammys indicates that, if anything, an expansion of the movement\u2019s reach is still desired by many.\n\nEnsuring that the conversation remains galvanized around the Grammys, then, will be an important task for the rose wearers. Corden told the Hollywood Reporter that the topic will be a major part of the awards show \u2014 most visibly through a prominent performance by Kesha intended to spotlight the #MeToo movement.\n\nKesha has become an inadvertent leader in conversations about how to reform the music industry to keep sexual predators from being structurally protected, due to her long fight to win contractual and financial independence from her alleged rapist and former manager, the producer Dr. Luke. Her struggle speaks to the ongoing need for conversations around abuse and assault in the music industry as well as to the growing call for change.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed it was really necessary,\u201d Harkins told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019ve all felt the political and cultural change in the last couple of months.\u201d\n\nStill, the Grammys are already receiving criticism for not doing more to center the ceremony on such a glaring issue. Whether or not the red carpet is full of white roses, all eyes will be on the men and women of the music industry to see what comes next.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672267/GettyImages_1210300377.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6o0oNP74eOgSncfahbejN-uh9c=/0x0:5511x3640/1200x800/filters:focal(3063x791:3943x1671)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58470249/492767389.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672633/GettyImages_1136921947.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671897/shel_silverstein.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672426/GettyImages_1187901752.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672372/GettyImages_1210313287.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVgmeGPSSnvmMPaosQ6qmVUu6Fs=/0x0:5511x2885/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10103795/492767389.jpg.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672024/1218646346.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVgmeGPSSnvmMPaosQ6qmVUu6Fs=/0x0:5511x2885/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10103795/492767389.jpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aja Romano", "Dylan Matthews", "Riley Beggin", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Matthew Yglesias", "Constance Grady", "Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/26/16936616/why-2018-grammys-white-roses", "title": "Grammys 2018: why people are wearing white roses to the ceremony", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2018-01-26T16:35:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-28T18:52:35-05:00"}, "author": "Aja Romano", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Hundreds of women have mobilized to tell the Grammys, \"Time\u2019s Up.\"", "og": {"description": "Hundreds of women have mobilized to tell the Grammys, \"Time\u2019s Up.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVgmeGPSSnvmMPaosQ6qmVUu6Fs=/0x0:5511x2885/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10103795/492767389.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Rose (Rosa Dr John Snow), Rosaceae.", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "How #MeToo is spreading to the music industry: Grammys attendees will wear white roses", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/26/16936616/why-2018-grammys-white-roses"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/26/16936616/why-2018-grammys-white-roses", "title": "How #MeToo is spreading to the music industry: Grammys attendees will wear white roses", "description": "Hundreds of women have mobilized to tell the Grammys, \"Time\u2019s Up.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wprq6WYH5FfSulcSKMSh5WHfCDI=/0x0:5511x2756/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10103795/492767389.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Rose (Rosa Dr John Snow), Rosaceae."}, "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Why Grammys attendees will be wearing white roses", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,culture,latest-news,grammy-awards", "sailthru.description": "Hundreds of women have mobilized to tell the Grammys, \"Time\u2019s Up.\"", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-26T16:35:02-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sN4BOJbknZ3UBPPXmagy1ixccSE=/0x0:5511x3100/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58470247/492767389.jpg.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HizscVkgnAWbT_NUCUucu3ugx9E=/1683x0:5323x3640/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58470247/492767389.jpg.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "latest-news"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516896000.0, "source": "https://www.vox.com", "summary": ""}
