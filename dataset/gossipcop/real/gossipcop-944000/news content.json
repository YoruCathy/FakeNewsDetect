He said he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to, if he\u2019s around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m in town, yeah, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he told E! News reporter Will Marfuggi. \u201cIt films, like, 10 minutes from my house, so that would be dope. I mean, you can\u2019t do Parks and Rec without Andy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI miss Andy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love it. I know I would do it.\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it, the answer to all (one) of your (my) questions.
