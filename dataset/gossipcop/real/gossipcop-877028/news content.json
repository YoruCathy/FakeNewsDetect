I don\u2019t know why it makes me so upset. It just really makes me really upset,\u201d she said, with tears in her eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fake it. My grandma\u2019s sitting here, my mom\u2019s here, and I go home to my seven dogs. If I didn\u2019t have that anymore, it would just be really hard.\u201d\n\nCyrus continued, \u201cI\u2019m really happy to help any way that I can and I hope people understand and can put themselves in those people\u2019s shoes and know what it feels like to have everything taken away from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that my friend @MileyCyrus stepped up for the people of #Texas and is donating half a million dollars,\u201d DeGeneres wrote on Instagram, alongside the above clip from her show.\n\nDeGeneres also made a massive donation of her own to Harvey relief funds, giving $1 million to Houston Texans star J.J. Watt, who\u2019s raised over $7 million through his crowdfunding page to help families in need.\n\nWhen #Texas needed him, @JJWatt was there. I was honored to help make this amazing gift from @Walmart possible. https://t.co/bObBtijEwq \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) August 31, 2017\n\nCyrus and DeGeneres are just two of the celebrities who\u2019ve stepped up to the plate to help families in Texas.\n\nSandra Bullock donated $1 million to relief efforts, while Kevin Hart gave $25,000 to the American Red Cross and urged his celebrity friends to do the same. The Kardashian family answered Hart\u2019s call and donated $500,000, as well.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c812dfe2400009c04a2c59f.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32ae1b1600004700c4ffba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a8148a1700002000287a1b.png?cache=lahqocsxh7&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a8148a1700002000287a1b.png?cache=lahqocsxh7&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miley-cyrus-hurricane-harvey-donation_n_59a80fd7e4b07e81d3559af8", "title": "Miley Cyrus Tears Up Discussing Her $500,000 Donation To Harvey Relief", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m really happy to help any way that I can.\"", "keywords": "Celebrities,Texas,Ellen DeGeneres,miley cyrus,Pop Music,Hurricane Harvey,The Ellen DeGeneres Show,houston texas", "og": {"title": "Miley Cyrus Tears Up Discussing Her $500,000 Donation To Harvey Relief", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a8148a1700002000287a1b.png?cache=lahqocsxh7&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a8148a1700002000287a1b.png?cache=lahqocsxh7&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miley-cyrus-hurricane-harvey-donation_n_59a80fd7e4b07e81d3559af8", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m really happy to help any way that I can.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,Texas,Ellen DeGeneres,miley cyrus,Pop Music,Hurricane Harvey,The Ellen DeGeneres Show,houston texas", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-08-31 10:37:57 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-09-01 00:04:57 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Miley Cyrus Tears Up Discussing Her $500,000 Donation To Harvey Relief", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a8148a1700002000287a1b.png?cache=lahqocsxh7&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\u201cI\u2019m really happy to help any way that I can.\""}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59a80fd7e4b07e81d3559af8", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504190277.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
