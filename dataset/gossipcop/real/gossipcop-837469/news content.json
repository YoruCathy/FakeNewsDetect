{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_(giraffe)", "text": "April (born 2002) is a reticulated giraffe at the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, in the United States. She gained worldwide fame after a live video of her in the late stages of pregnancy, along with the subsequent birth, were put on YouTube. The birth was watched live by nearly 1.2 million viewers.\n\nLife [ edit ]\n\nApril was born in 2002 at the Catskill Game Farm in Catskill, New York. She resided at the Catskill Game Farm until it closed in October 2006, when she was relocated to Adirondack Animal Land in Broadalbin, New York.[3]\n\nAnimal Adventure Park owned by Jordan Patch acquired 13-year-old April shortly after acquiring Oliver, a much younger 3-year-old male giraffe, in 2015. Oliver and April soon mated, which resulted in her pregnancy that normally lasts 18 months.[4] It was Oliver's first siring and April's fourth pregnancy;[5] she had previously mothered three other giraffes, two males and a female named Autumn, with a male giraffe named Stretch.[2] After becoming pregnant, at Animal Adventure Park she became a \"viral sensation\" in February 2017 while being monitored by a live stream.[6][7][8][9] An estimated 1.2 million viewers watched the live feed of the giraffe giving birth on YouTube; the live feed was sponsored by Toys R Us and Babies R Us, as a play on that chain's mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe.[5] By the time the camera was shut off, the YouTube feed had accumulated 232 million views.[10] A GoFundMe fundraiser page that initially set a goal of $50,000 sat at more than $135,000 by the time the calf was born. The money is to be used to offset the annual care for the animals and upgrading the giraffe exhibit at the park.[11]\n\nWith the prolonged wait for April to enter labor, some people had questioned if the pregnancy was an April Fools' Day joke,[12][13][14] and other conspiracy theories had also been put forward.[15] Prior to the birth, April's veterinarian Dr Tim Slater stated that despite a great sense of anticipation, the birth of her calf was not considered overdue.[16] On April 8, 2017, April's zookeeper Allysa Swilley and caretaker Corey Dwyer stated that April was big, full of milk and \"closer\" to giving birth, but at this time, the calf is \"just not coming out.\" A live stream of April's pregnancy has been posted to the video-sharing site YouTube. A minor controversy resulted when YouTube briefly removed the stream in late February 2017 following complaints from animal activists of the video allegedly violating standards in regards to nudity and sexual activity. Following thousands of complaints from YouTube users, the stream was restored to the website within an hour.[17]\n\nOn April 15, 2017, Animal Adventure Park announced April had gone into labor, noting that the calf's hooves had come out of the womb and that it would take between 30 minutes and two hours from that point to complete the birth. The calf, a male[5] with a height of 5.75 feet (1.75 m) and weighing 129 pounds (59 kg),[18] was born at approximately 9:54 a.m. Eastern Time.[4] The giraffe cam was shut off at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on April 21, with the staff appearing on camera before the shutoff to express their thanks.[10] The calf was named Tajiri as a result of a name-the-baby contest, from the Swahili language word for \"hope\".[19]\n\nOn July 25, 2018, Animal Adventure Park announced that April and Oliver had conceived a second time earlier in the year.[20] This calf, also a male,[21] was born at 12:43 p.m. Eastern Time on March 16, 2019; as with Tajiri's birth, the birth was live-streamed on the Internet, with 300,000 viewers at the time of birth.[22] On March 16, 2019, at 12:43 pm April gave birth to her fourth son, Azizi (Ah-Zee-Zee) weighing 139 pounds with a height of 5 feet and 11 inches. The calf was on his feet at 1:27 pm; and was observed nursing at 1:51 pm.\n\nApril was placed on birth control in June 2019 and would enter senior care after her handlers observed behavior that made them believe that further calf bearing would be hazardous to her health. During her retirement, she will be housed with her two youngest children Tajiri and Azizi. Animal Adventure Park acquired another female giraffe, Johari, to continue breeding of the species with Oliver.[23]\n\nOn November 25th, 2019, it was announced that Azizi, April's youngest calf, will be moving to East Texas Zoo & Gator Park in Grand Saline, Texas, in spring 2020. The reason being that he is growing faster than older brother Tajiri, and also taking to alfalfa hay and fortified pelleted giraffe diet early on in his development.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Okapi2.jpg/32px-Okapi2.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_New_York.svg/32px-Flag_of_New_York.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_(giraffe)", "title": "April (giraffe)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
