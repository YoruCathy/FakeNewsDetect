When someone I knew, someone I had loved as a brother, was accused, I did something inexcusable: I publicly spoke up in his defense,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere are few acts I could ever regret more in this life. I didn\u2019t have the \u2018insider information\u2019 I claimed but rather blind faith in a story that kept slipping and changing and revealed itself to mean nothing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to feel my workplace and my world were safe, untouched by the outside world (a privilege in and of itself, the privilege of ignoring what hasn\u2019t hurt you) and I claimed that safety at cost to someone else, someone very special,\u201d she continued.\n\nDunham also apologized directly to Perrineau, 24.\n\n\u201cTo Aurora: You have been on my mind and in my heart every day this year,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you. I will always love you. I will always work to right that wrong. In that way, you have made me a better woman and a better feminist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been given that job in addition to your other burdens, but here we are, and here I am asking: How do we move forward? Not just you and I but all of us, living in the gray space between admission and vindication,\u201d she continued.\n\nDunham said that it was \u201cpainful to realize\u201d that she \u201chad actually internalized the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what, protect it no matter what, baby it no matter what.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some who will think I am writing this to curry public favor (that\u2019s OK, though, I stopped thinking that was an option for me somewhere around 2014, and that\u2019s some kind of freedom),\u201d she added. \u201cI have the only women I want or need in my life. And this is the Women in Entertainment issue, and women in entertainment need healing. Sometimes healing starts with the words: I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jay L. Clendenin/Contour/Getty\n\nPerrineau, daughter of Lost star Harold Perrineau, alleged Miller sexually assaulted her in 2012 when she was only 17. She filed a complaint last year about the alleged attack with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Office, claiming that she met Miller at L.A.\u2019s Standard Hotel with friends in 2012 and \u201cconsumed some alcoholic beverages.\u201d She alleged Miller, then 35, asked them for a ride home, where they all went inside, reluctantly on her part, after arriving.\n\nIn her statement for a polygraph test taken in September 2017, she claimed she awoke naked in his bed where he was \u201chaving sexual intercourse\u201d with her, against her consent.\n\nMiller\u2019s attorney, Matthew Walerstein, told The Wrap at the time he \u201ccategorically and vehemently denies Ms. Perrineau\u2019s outrageous claims,\u201d adding that his legal team had \u201cgathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims.\u201d\n\nDunham and alongside Girls co-creator Jenni Konner then released a statement in which they voiced their support for Miller and insinuated that Perrineau \u201cmisreported\u201d the rape. The statement was met with serious backlash, and Dunham later issued an apology on Twitter.\n\nIn an interview with New York Magazine last month, Dunham said Perrineau\u2019s allegations went public two days after she had undergone an elective total hysterectomy in the hopes of treating her chronic pain caused by endometriosis, and she was she was \u201chigh as a f\u2014ing kite\u201d from the surgery.\n\nWhen she was asked to comment on the allegations, Dunham \u2014 who has been public about her experiences with sexual assault \u2014 said she recalling thinking: \u201cWell, people know that I\u2019m an advocate for these issues, so if I say this, they\u2019ll know I\u2019m not coming from X or Y place. \u2026 I think I was just like, F\u2014 everyone else. This is my tribe. Let\u2019s keep it safe.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Flena-dunham-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Flena-dunham-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Flena-dunham-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/lena-dunham-apologizes-defending-girls-writer-accused-rape/", "title": "Lena Dunham Apologizes for Defending Girls Writer Accused of Rape", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Girls,Lena Dunham,News,Sexual Assault,TV", "news_keywords": "Girls,Lena Dunham,News,Sexual Assault,TV", "description": "Actress Aurora Perrineau previously accused Girls writer Murray Miller of sexually assaulting her when she was 17", "og": {"title": "Lena Dunham on Defending\u00a0Girls Writer Accused of Rape: 'I Did Something Inexcusable'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-dunham-apologizes-defending-girls-writer-accused-rape/", "description": "Lena Dunham&nbsp;is opening up about her \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d In her guest editor letter for The Hollywood Reporter\u2018s Women in Entertainment issue, Dunham, 32, once again&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Flena-dunham-1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-dunham-apologizes-defending-girls-writer-accused-rape/", "description": "Actress Aurora Perrineau previously accused Girls writer Murray Miller of sexually assaulting her when she was 17", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Flena-dunham-1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-dunham-apologizes-defending-girls-writer-accused-rape/", "title": "Lena Dunham on Defending\u00a0Girls Writer Accused of Rape: 'I Did Something Inexcusable'", "description": "Actress Aurora Perrineau previously accused Girls writer Murray Miller of sexually assaulting her when she was 17", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Flena-dunham-1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
