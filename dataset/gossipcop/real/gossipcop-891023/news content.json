John McCain and new co-host of ABC's The View, is engaged, she revealed on her show Thursday. Us Weekly first reported the news on Wednesday.\n\n\"You have read something about me on the Internet last night. I am engaged. We've been together for years, we've been engaged for a while. It was a secret. I was hoping people wouldn't find out, but people talk sometimes,\" she said.\n\nWhat's their engagement story? She jokes on the show that it's \"not the most romantic.\"\n\n\"Well, we were at Mayo Clinic and my father had his scan, and we got engaged because we decided to sort of celebrate life and celebrate being alive,\" she said. Sen. McCain revealed in September that doctors gave him a \"poor prognosis\" on his fight with brain cancer.\n\nWho is Meghan McCain's groom-to-be? According to a verified Twitter account from conservative writer Ben Domenech, it's him.\n\n\"Love you bae,\" he tweeted Wednesday night, with a link to a Page Six story about the impending nuptials. McCain retweeted his message on her account.\n\nSen. McCain also posted about the engagement, tweeting to the couple: \"We are so happy for you & thrilled to welcome Ben to our family.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e57cd43e7a1cda6f008427157da47fdc8ef3cf73/c=0-126-2317-1435/local/-/media/2017/11/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636451737188645913-d01-Meghan-McCain-23.jpg?width=2317&height=1309&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/134f554a7a48a754ea2d627811215c4ee035249a/c=36-0-2286-3000/local/-/media/2017/11/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636451737188645913-d01-Meghan-McCain-23.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e57cd43e7a1cda6f008427157da47fdc8ef3cf73/c=0-126-2317-1435/local/-/media/2017/11/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636451737188645913-d01-Meghan-McCain-23.jpg?width=2317&height=1309&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/11/02/meghan-mccain-engaged-the-view/824039001/", "title": "'The View' co-host Meghan McCain got engaged after dad's cancer scan 'to celebrate life'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "'The View' co-host Meghan McCain got engaged after dad's cancer scan 'to celebrate life'", "description": "Sen.
