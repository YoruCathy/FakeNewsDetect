After a fan commented, \u201cEddie Murphy Is Funnier Than Kevin Hart Still,\u201d Epps reportedly replied with the since-deleted, \u201cS\u2014 everybody is\u2026\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nHart, 39, didn\u2019t take the dig laying down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that not everybody is not selling tickets like me tho,\u201d Hart responded in the comments.\n\nThings heated up when Comedy Hype shared a link to the feud article on their Instagram page, when Epps commented that the news was \u201cnot press worthy.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Hart replied, \u201cAll I can say is that your a sad individual. I talked to you several times face to face in attempts to put the B.S behind us. I even reached out to u like a man and tried to get to the bottom of your bitterness. When will you realize that my success has nothing to do with you or your journey.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cUnlike you I want to see you win\u2026I\u2019m actually a fan champ. I\u2019m praying for the day that you will realize that so many of us entertainers have a crabs in a barrell mentallity. You are the biggest crab I know\u2026I will continue to shine and continue to make history and continue to do comedy at the HIGHEST level. If that makes u sick then so be it\u2026.I will hand u a throw up bucket because this next year that I\u2019m about to have will be my best Mr bitter\u2026..While u worry about this Grown Little man please know and understand that all I am worried about is SUCCESS!!!! #CatchUp.\u201d\n\nEpps then accused Hart of trying to be a victim in the comments section.\n\n\u201cI said it \u2018wasn\u2019t press worthy\u2019 and here you go as usual trying to show the world how great you are because people pick on you. Gtfoh! You have a long line of s\u2014 to clean up before you can hand me a MF bucket,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this s\u2014 25+ yrs Mr. Victim. Don\u2019t get too cute lil brother. This s\u2014 is a lifetime achievement. & stop following my comments around the World Wide Web.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHow do you find this s\u2014? I talk about everybody but you always take it personal. The whole internet talk about you, so don\u2019t stop here you got a lot of responding to do. And for everybody reading this me and Kevin been knowing each other too long so this is not a beef. If it was I would have never responded. Again, like I told you face to face Congrats on everything man. You seem to be a great person\u2026 but I stilll don\u2019t think yo a\u2014 funny.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kevin Hart and Mike Epps Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty; Rob Latour/REX/Shutterstock\n\nNick Cannon also chimed in, writing, \u201cOMG Back Back!! N\u2014 you too good with these words, make them N\u2014 Back track!!! LOL Which one of y\u2019all is Meek and who\u2019s Drake?? Y\u2019all both funnier than me but both of y\u2019all UGLY AS S\u2014!!! Yeah I said it!! Now go to sleep on them expensive ass pillows!!!\u201d\n\nEpps replied to Cannon, \u201cnick getcho 7/11 hat wearing a\u2014 back.\u201d\n\nThe smack talk started when Epps called Hart \u201cone overrated comedian\u201d during a 2014 radio interview, according to the Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Hollywood is, if you\u2019re in a movie and you\u2019re good in it and it don\u2019t make money, guess what? You won\u2019t get recognized,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot of bad movies that comedians get in and they\u2019re not good in them and they make money, and then people just keep putting them in movies.\u201d\n\nThe two then traded jabs on social media.\n\nEpps and Hart appeared to put their differences behind them when Epps shared an Instagram video with the Ride Along star in June 2017.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fkevin-hart1-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fkevin-hart1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fkevin-hart1-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/kevin-hart-slams-mike-epps-sad-individual-ongoing-feud/", "title": "Kevin Hart Calls Mike Epps a 'Sad Individual' in Ongoing Feud as Nick Cannon Chimes In", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kevin Hart,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "news_keywords": "Kevin Hart,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "description": "Kevin Hart and Mike Epps have taken their beef to Instagram's comment section", "og": {"title": "Kevin Hart Calls Mike Epps a 'Sad Individual' in Ongoing Feud as Nick Cannon Chimes In", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/kevin-hart-slams-mike-epps-sad-individual-ongoing-feud/", "description": "Kevin Hart and Mike Epps have taken their beef to Instagram\u2019s comment section.
