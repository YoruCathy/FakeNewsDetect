The reception marks the first time Catherine has been seen in public since announcing her pregnancy in early September.\n\nThe mother of two suffers from Hyperemesis Gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness in her pregnancies and it forced her to miss several engagements, including Prince George\u2019s first day of school.\n\n\u201cThe Duchess\u2019 condition is improving but she\u2019s still suffering from Hyperemesis Gravidarum,\u201d a royal aide told E! News. \u201cShe\u2019s delighted to be here tonight.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Duchess Catherine has a new secret weapon to help aid against morning sickness\n\nShe is reportedly less than 12 weeks into her pregnancy.\n\nThe royals celebrated the impact of their Heads Together Charity that encourages people to speak out about their struggles with mental health.\n\nPrince William reportedly spoke about how \u201cproud\u201d he was to be involved and credited his wife for coming up with the idea.\n\n\u201cIt was Catherine who first realized that all three of us were working on mental health in our individual areas of focus,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had seen that at the core of adult issues like addiction and family breakdown, unresolved childhood mental health issues were often part of the problem.\u201d", "images": ["https://coxrare.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/facebook_steve-harvey.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=24608208&cv=2.0&cj=1",
