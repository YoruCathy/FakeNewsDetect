These families have crisis or disasters happening \u2026 people don\u2019t realize something as small as having clean clothes just makes you feel so good about yourself,\u201d said Decker, 29.\n\n\u201cI remember being in school and there\u2019s certain kids that weren\u2019t as fortunate and they\u2019d wear the same clothes over and over again and you know that they just hadn\u2019t been washed,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou could tell it made them insecure and made them feel bad, so I love that this is something for people to turn to when something like that happens.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

We\u2019re just leaving it up in the air and leaving it in God\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve always felt like we wanted three children,\u201d Decker continues. \u201cI came from a family of three kids. [For Eric], it was just him and his sister, and he said he always felt like they were missing a sibling and he wishes [his parents] would have had three. So I just didn\u2019t want Vivi or Bubby to feel like they wish they had another sibling.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Spring Training?

I do everything,\u201d Decker explains. \u201cBut whenever they were filming just me and Eric or just me and my sister or something, I would schedule it around their naps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I would have them start when the kids went to sleep and have them gone before the kids woke up so the kids never even knew a crew was there,\u201d she adds. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to disrupt them as much as I could, even though it didn\u2019t really feel disruptive to them because they\u2019re used to their parents working and being in show business. But as much as I could shield them, I did.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Former Bachelorette Emily Maynard Johnson Says She Wants 2 More Kids to Up Her Total to 5\n\nRELATED: Jessie James Decker Will Be \u201cProtective\u201d of Her Kids on New Season of Eric & Jessie: \u201cThey\u2019re the First Priority\u201d\n\nFor the time being, Decker can focus on the pregnancy of her younger sister Sydney \u2014 whom she has been very generous with when it comes to maternity wear.\n\n\u201cI gave Sydney everything,\u201d she tells PEOPLE. \u201cI had boxes of maternity stuff and I went through everything and I just kept going, \u2018Oh my God, these are the best \u2026 no, these are the best.
