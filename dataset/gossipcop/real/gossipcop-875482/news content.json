Though the Real Housewives of New York star has remained relatively private about her difficult relationship with her ex-husband, she opened up about the \u201ctorment and torture\u201d she\u2019s faced on last night\u2019s reunion part 2 episode. The Skinnygirl creator discussed the aftermath of the harassment and stalking charges brought against Jason and how difficult life has been since the split.\n\nThe 46-year-old father was arrested in January for threatening the Bravolebrity at their 7-year-old daughter Bryn\u2019s school and the case is currently still in court. Though it\u2019s been an emotional few months for the business mogul, she wants nothing to do with the father of her child.\n\n\u201cAny resolution is legally mandated and I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d the 46-year-old told host Andy Cohen last night. \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens, I have faith that somehow I will be able to live a normal free life. But it has to be with zero contact. Because with any contact, this will not end.\u201d\n\nBethenny and Jason got married in March 2010 and had their daughter just two months later.\n\n\u201cIt is indescribable and it is inexplicable and it\u2019s like, if someone wants to talk about like a war zone in Israel, how are you going to explain that to someone?\u201d she revealed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not comparing this to actual war but in my life, you can\u2019t even imagine the torment that this has been. There\u2019s no way to describe it. I just stifled it in because if I let any of it out, I\u2019m going to totally break down. I can\u2019t believe this happened to me.\u201d The pain and anguish has been so much a part of her life, she\u2019s not even sure how to articulate it to other people.\n\n\u201cIt was part of my life. I thought I was never getting out of it. I couldn\u2019t even understand it. How can I explain this to everybody?\u201d she asked.\n\nCredit: Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never \u2014 it is torture. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t explain it. There\u2019s no way to describe this to anybody. Nobody would believe it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, fellow cast member Carole Radziwill believes Jason is obsessed with his ex-wife. \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with her. It\u2019s like an obsession. And I guess when someone walks away and you no longer have control?\u201d Carole said.\n\nA post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel) on Aug 20, 2017 at 5:21am PDT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known you [Bethenny] a few years now. When we first started getting close, I saw all the times you tried to reach your daughter, FaceTime your daughter.\u201d The 54-year-old continued, \u201cAnd he would sometimes pick up the phone and hang up or face it to the wall. Weird stuff. And I thought, \u2018Wow, this guy is a little off.\u2019 But now, I don\u2019t think you even realized at a certain point how painful and the emotional havoc it played on your life.\u201d", "images": ["http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/26152787_1896505867329996_8668809372878503936_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bethenny-frankel-trump.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery-pregnant-320x223-1511803275.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21149338_757212517791923_6938295666963644416_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-519451536-320x223-1495779173.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/wetpaint.svg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-10.09.58-AM.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-10.09.58-AM-750x522.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-10.09.58-AM-640x480.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/loading.gif", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nick-carter-sexual-assault-320x223-1509372738.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21041889_254812198371809_8175695720834138112_n-320x223.jpg"], "top_img": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-10.09.58-AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "http://wetpaint.com/rhony-season-9-reunion-bethenny-frankel-divorce-1612762/", "title": "Bethenny Frankel Gets Real About \u201cTortuous\u201d Divorce on \u2018RHONY\u2019 Reunion Part 2", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "On last night\u2019s episode of the RHONY, Bethenny Frankel opens up about her emotional divorce from Jason Hoppy and how he\u2019s \u201cobsessed\u201d with her.", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "RHONY Season 9 Reunion: Bethenny Frankel Divorce Jason Hoppy", "description": "On last night\u2019s episode of the RHONY, Bethenny Frankel opens up about her emotional divorce from Jason Hoppy and how he\u2019s \u201cobsessed\u201d with her.", "url": "http://wetpaint.com/rhony-season-9-reunion-bethenny-frankel-divorce-1612762/", "site_name": "Wetpaint", "updated_time": "2017-08-24T12:32:36-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-10.09.58-AM.png", "width": 939, "height": 578}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Wetpaint", "tag": "News", "section": "4.
