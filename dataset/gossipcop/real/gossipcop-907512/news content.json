I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it,\u201d the actress told Piers Morgan on his ITV series, Life Stories. \u201cAnother actress should play it, maybe they could make it an African American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones?\u2019\n\nSo if Michael Patrick King and the Sex and the City team were to recast Samantha Jones, who would be the best replacement? Scroll through below to see some actors we think would fit in nicely with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte.\n\nSia Taylor Hill/Getty Images The Australian pop songstress already threw her hat in the ring on Twitter. If Sia was cast would Samantha suddenly have an obsession with face-covering masks and wigs? One thing is for sure: Her Sex and the City song would be better than Fergie\u2019s. Jane Krakowski Do we really need to sell you on this? Krakowski has basically played more outrageous versions of Samantha on 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Maybe she could even bring Tituss with her into the Sex and the City universe. Vanessa Williams Wilhelmina Slater, her character on Ugly Betty, was just as ballsy as Samantha, and now she\u2019s currently playing the lead on VH1\u2019s hit, Daytime Divas. Samantha Jones as a talk show host? Consider our DVRs set. Kristy Swanson She already followed in Cattrall footsteps in Mannequin 2, so why not keep the casting full circle? Sofia Vergara Cattrall would love a hispanic actress to play Samantha, and we think Vergara\u2019s perfect comedic timing would be perfect for the antics in Sex and the City. Jean Smart Paramount We love her, and she is not in enough things. Plus, you know they always get mistaken for each other anyway. Hedda Lettuce One of the most notable New York drag queens, Hedda would be a perfect choice because she has already played a Samantha Jones drag queen. In the second season episode, \u201cOld Dogs, New Dicks,\u201d Hedda\u2019s male alter ego, Steven Polito, plays Brad, an ex-boyfriend of Samantha, who she runs into at drag queen bingo. Brad\u2019s drag is a striking resemblance to his ex-girlfriend, and her drag name is even Samantha. \u201cImitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\u201d Brad tells her in the scene. Joanna Lumley Forget Samantha altogether and have Carrie and the girls travel to London for an epic Absolutely Fabulous/Sex and the City crossover. Valerie Cherish HBO HBO synergy at its finest. We love this inspired casting choice, and we can definitely imagine Valerie meeting up with the other girls at brunch and saying, \u201cWell, I got it!\u201d when asked about her latest sexual conquest.", "images": ["http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-646005866-1507655434-1507655435.jpg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/samantha-stupid-1507657319-1507657321.gif", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/patsy-ab-fab-1507657720-1507657722.gif", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/14-sofia-gloria-modern-family-1507656066-1507656068.gif", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/krakowski-ghost-1507655650-1507655652.gif", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:251283?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vanessa-1507655741-1507655742.gif", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/comeback-sex-and-the-city-1507656550-1507656551.jpeg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:251283?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jean-smart-1507656217-1507656218.jpg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480"], "top_img": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:251283?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rudolph"], "canonical_link": "http://www.newnownext.com/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones/10/2017/", "title": "Who We Would Love To See Replace Kim Cattrall In \u201cSex And The City 3\u201d", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "newnownext"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:541338"}, "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "title": "Who We Would Love To See Replace Kim Cattrall In \"Sex And The City 3\"", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones/10/2017/", "image": {"identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:251283?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "Someone call Jean Smart!"}, "sm4": {"author": "Christopher Rudolph", "type": "Post"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1774721959458948}, "twitter": {"description": "Someone call Jean Smart!", "title": "Who We Would Love To See Replace Kim Cattrall In \u201cSex And The City 3\u201d", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:251283?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/sex-and-the-city-kim-cattrall-replacement-samantha-jones/10/2017/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Someone call Jean Smart!", "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/samantha-movie-1507658251-1507658252-300x200.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1oy_TQ9tyE?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXcmksS2p5g?start=173&feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newnownext.com", "summary": ""}
