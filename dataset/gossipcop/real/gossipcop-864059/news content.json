It was an impostor.\n\nInstead of walking the red carpet, the comedian sent a body double in his place, who even did a few red carpet interviews while pretending to be Buress.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday (that have all been deleted), Buress, who plays Coach Wilson in the new flick, said he was seeking \"a look-alike with solid comedic timing for an event tonight.\" He asked for photos and offered $500 as a reward.\n\nFast forward a few hours later, and a man identifying himself as Buress walked the red carpet at the premiere. But he was not Hannibal Buress.\n\nCelebrity Look-Alikes\n\nIn fact, Buress even tweeted a photo of the \"look-alike\" and sarcastically added, \"I'm out here at the @SpiderManMovie premiere.\"\n\nSo, who was Buress' doppelganger? A man named Joe Carroll, who resides in Los Angeles and describes himself as an author, screenwriter, director, and actor.\n\nCarroll took to social media to capture the fun evening, sharing several photos.\n\nSeveral media outlets fell for the trick, and Buress simply responded with, \"FOMO.\" LOL!\"\n\nFOMO is online slang for \"fear of missing out.\"\n\n\n\nBuress plays a high school coach in the Spider-man reboot. A fledgling actor who's appeared in a few films, Buress may be better known as the comedian who helped get the Bill Cosby sexual assault investigation underway in earnest after telling a joke about the star during a stand-up routine, promoting renewed interest in decades old allegations.", "images": ["https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/buressspiderman.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/San_Diego_On_Light@3x-1.png?fit=381%2C120", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/San_Diego_On_Dark@3x-2.png?fit=381%2C120", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/goodnews2-apr17.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/GettyImages-1219262470.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1024px%2C576px&resize=850%2C478"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/buressspiderman.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kendall Fisher"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/864059/hannibal-buress-hired-a-body-double-to-take-his-place-at-the-spider-man-homecoming-premiere-and-people-fell-for-it", "title": "Double Take: Hannibal Buress Hired a Body Double for \u2018Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2019 Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 7 San Diego", "type": "article", "description": "No, that was not Hannibal Buress at the \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d premiere.
