Other family members \u2014 who were not present for the attack \u2014 insisted his death was not related to the fight.\n\n\u201cThe present charges are based on the facts as we presently know them,\u201d said local district attorney Gerard Leone.\n\n\u201cAny further charging developments will be based in large measure upon a reliance on the final opinion issued by the Chief Medical Examiner regarding the cause and manner of death of the decedent.\u201d\n\nThe fight happened in Nancy Kerrigan\u2019s childhood home, where she first dreamed of Olympic stardom.\n\nShe was a self-described tomboy with two hockey-playing big brothers until her parents began to nurture her love of figure skating\n\nDaniel Kerrigan, a welder, drove a Zamboni ice-cleaning machine at the local rink in exchange for her practice time on the ice, and the parents took out a second mortgage on their home to help pay for her skating lessons.\n\nNancy, who still skates at exhibitions, was spotted yesterday enter- ing the bright yellow house on Cedar Avenue, hours after an emergency crew carried her father out.\n\nHer pained expression contrasted with the electric smile that warmed fans all over the world after she pirouetted her way to Olympic eminence, winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Games.\n\nShe got a silver medal at the Olympics two years later in Lillehammer, Norway.\n\nBut before her second appearance, rival skater Tonya Harding hired a goon to attack her during an Olympic qualifying session.\n\nHe whacked her with a collapsible baton just above her right knee. The attacker was jailed, Harding paid a $150,000 fine and Kerrigan recovered completely.\n\n\u201cI hate the fact that the Kerrigan\u2019s laundry is aired out in newspapers all around the world and everybody has to know all about us,\u201d her other brother, Michael, said at the time.\n\nNancy married her manager, Jerry Solomon, in 1995. They live in Lynnfield, Mass., and have three children.\n\nNeighbors in the suburban Boston town remembered Daniel Kerrigan as a man who doted on his daughter and was completely devoted to all his children.\n\n\u201cIt is a terrible, terrible thing,\u201d said neighbor Betty Svendsen. \u201cHe is the loveliest man. He sacrificed all of his life for his children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom. I\u2019m in shock.\u201d\n\nStoneham resident Jim Sarno said, \u201cI\u2019ll always remember how he helped young skaters at the Stoneham rink. I can still visualize him on the Zamboni making ice.\u201d\n\nNeighbors recalled a close-knit family, but court papers filed in 2008 revealed severe problems brewing under the surface.\n\nAccording to records, Nancy\u2019s parents sued Mark in 2006, claiming he owed them $105,000 for taking care of his dogs, paying his mortgage and for hiring a lawyer to represent him on assault charges in 2006.\n\nMark\u2019s address at the time was listed as the Middlesex County House of Correction, where he was serving a sentence for the assault.\n\nMark was held on $10,000 bail yesterday after an arraignment during which he hung his head and wept.\n\nProsecutors said he had a long criminal record that included arrests for assault and battery, assault with a dangerous weapon, malicious destruction and violation of a restraining order.\n\nHe was released in November and has been living in his parents\u2019 basement ever since.\n\nFamily and friends came to the house in the steady rain yesterday, delivering food and heartfelt prayers.\n\nSome recalled how the media flocked to the neighborhood when Nancy\u2019s career peaked. Now the spotlight was back, and no one was happy.\n\n\u201cWe were all so thrilled for Nancy then,\u201d Svendsen said. \u201cShe\u2019s devoted to her mother and will be her strength.\u201d\n\nleonard.greene@nypost.com\n\n", "images": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/online-piano-class.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/daniel_kerrigan-300x300.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/daniel_kerrigan-300x300.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/knewz_300x250.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/daniel_kerrigan-300x300.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2010/01/26/kerrigans-family-tragedy/", "title": "Kerrigan\u2019s family tragedy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
