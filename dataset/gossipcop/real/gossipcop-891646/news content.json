You know, everybody\u2019s different. But there was something about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly thought I was asexual \u2014 I\u2019d never been turned on like that in my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s that feeling\u2026 okay! That\u2019s what they were talking about in Waiting to Exhale.\u2019 I just got it. I just didn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kelly Clarkson at the SiriusXM Meaning of Life album listening session Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nThe pair, who married in 2013, first met at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2006 where she was performing a duet with Rascal Flatts on their tune \u201cWhat Hurts the Most.\u201d Blackstock was the country group\u2019s tour manager at the time.\n\n\u201cMy guitar player\u2019s wife Ashley was my date for that night and we had just both been in crap relationships,\u201d Clarkson explained. \u201cSometimes it sucks dating because it\u2019s so many wrong ones until you get the right one. And we were like, \u2018Okay, what we\u2019ve been doing wrong here\u2019 \u2014 because it was a country music event and we\u2019re both southern girls \u2014 we were like, \u2018We\u2019ve been dating skinny jeans and we need Wranglers.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cLiterally, I\u2019m not joking, he walked past us at that time,\u201d Clarkson continued. \u201cAnd he walked by, I was like, ready to take it all off. I just felt something.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Brandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson as the 2013 Grammy Awards Christopher Polk/Getty\n\nRELATED: 14 Times Kelly Clarkson Made More Sense Than Everyone Else\n\nNothing happened then, of course. He was married at the time to Melissa Ashworth, and as Clarkson was quick to point out to the crowd, she \u201cain\u2019t that girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t even talk to him,\u201d she said, explaining that it wasn\u2019t until 2012, when Blackstock and Ashworth divorced, that Clarkson even saw him again \u2014 well after learning about his split from Blackstock\u2019s father, Narvel (who was managing her), and Narvel\u2019s now ex-wife Reba McEntire.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really know each other; I had just met him that one time,\u201d Clarkson recalled. \u201cJust from that one time, even six years later, I had never really dated anyone. I honest to God thought, \u2018Is this what it\u2019s like to be asexual?\u2019 I was just not attracted to people.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kelly Clarkson at the 2012 Super Bowl Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nClarkson and Blackstock would finally end up meeting at the Super Bowl in 2012, where she was performing the national anthem and Blake Shelton, whom Blackstock manages, was singing \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d (alongside his now ex-wife Miranda Lambert).\n\nThe event was high-pressure for Clarkson, and not for the reasons one might think.\n\n\u201cI was so nervous because it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to suck for the millions of people watching, I didn\u2019t want to suck because I was trying to impress a guy,\u201d Clarkson joked. \u201cI wanted him to be like, \u2018Damn.\u2019 It had nothing to do with the Super Bowl!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even know each other, but he had walked past me once and there was a moment in my crazy head,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thought I hated him, too. When I finally confessed that, \u2018I really dig you,\u2019 He was so shocked because he thought I hated him. I hadn\u2019t let on that I liked him. Inside I was like, \u2018Ask me out!\u2019 but outside I was like, \u2018I love being single and coming home every night alone. It\u2019s awesome.\u2019\n\nImage zoom Brandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson in 2015 Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kelly Clarkson Claims She Was Drunk At the From Justin To Kelly Movie Premiere\n\nShe remained coy on what exactly she said that got Blackstock interested (\u201cIt involved alcohol \u2026 you get really bold when you\u2019re drunk\u201d). But looking back, on it all, the \u201cBecause of You\u201d singer \u2014 who shares four kids with Blackstock now, including 16-year-old stepdaughter Savannah, 10-year-old stepson Seth, 18-month-old son Remington \u201cRemy\u201d Alexander and 3-year-old daughter River Rose \u2014 knows that what she has with Blackstock is unique.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to find that feeling,\u2019 she said. \u201cI always tell [Savannah], \u2018Wait it out. Wait until you get those goosebumps.\u2019 Because if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fgettyimages-843532050-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkelly-clarkson-a-1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20139'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F12%2Fkelly-clarkson-news.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fkelly-clarkson-brandon-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F09%2Fkelly-clarkson3-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F12%2Fkelly-clarkson-news.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F12%2Fkelly-clarkson-news.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/kelly-clarkson-asexual-attraction-husband-brandon-blackstock/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson 'Never Felt Sexually Attracted to Anybody' Before Husband Brandon Blackstock", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Kelly Clarkson,Music News,News", "news_keywords": "Couples,Kelly Clarkson,Music News,News", "description": "During a private SiriusXM show in New York City Friday, Kelly Clarkson revealed that husband Brandon Blackstock was the first man that made her feel sexual", "og": {"title": "Kelly Clarkson 'Never Felt Sexually Attracted to Anybody' Before Husband Brandon Blackstock", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/kelly-clarkson-asexual-attraction-husband-brandon-blackstock/", "description": "Looks like Kelly Clarkson\u2018s red-hot romance with husband&nbsp;Brandon Blackstock might have inspired a lot more than just her&nbsp;confident and sexy anthems on her new album,&nbsp;Meaning&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F12%2Fkelly-clarkson-news.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 785}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/kelly-clarkson-asexual-attraction-husband-brandon-blackstock/", "description": "During a private SiriusXM show in New York City Friday, Kelly Clarkson revealed that husband Brandon Blackstock was the first man that made her feel sexual", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F12%2Fkelly-clarkson-news.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/kelly-clarkson-asexual-attraction-husband-brandon-blackstock/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson 'Never Felt Sexually Attracted to Anybody' Before Husband Brandon Blackstock", "description": "During a private SiriusXM show in New York City Friday, Kelly Clarkson revealed that husband Brandon Blackstock was the first man that made her feel sexual", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F12%2Fkelly-clarkson-news.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
