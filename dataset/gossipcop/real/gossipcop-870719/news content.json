Emma Roberts' Madison Montgomery might have died at the end of the third season, Coven, but her profile's only grown over these past four years thanks to \"Surprise, bitch.\" And earlier this month, Roberts confirmed her return to the AHS fold for the upcoming eighth season, Apocalypse.\n\nGiven that Apocalypse is the long-awaited Murder House/Coven crossover, Roberts' presence makes sense, and today on Instagram she shared the first actual image of Madison on the Murder House set.\n\nEW notes that Madison is standing in the spot where the gazebo once stood, after Ben (Dylan McDermott) built it to cover the evidence of Hayden's (Kate Mara) corpse. McDermott and Connie Britton are confirmed to return as Ben and Vivien, while Jessica Lange will also reprise her Season 1 role of Constance, making her first appearance on the show since Season 4, Freak Show.\n\nApocalypse is shaping up to be an all-star season, with a returning cast that also includes Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Kathy Bates, Adina Porter, Cheyenne Jackson, Frances Conroy, Billy Eichner, Gabourey Sidibe, Leslie Grossman, Billie Lourd, Lily Rabe, and Stevie Nicks. Cody Fern, who was a standout in the Ryan Murphy-produced The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, is also joining the show in the role of grown-up demon spawn Michael Langdon.\n\nProducer Alexis Martin Woodall has said the story \u201cbegins with the end of the world\u2014and then our world begins... It starts in the real world. It\u2019s very tangible, and it\u2019s a familiar panic.\u201d Creator Ryan Murphy stated that the show takes place in the near future. You can read more details about Apocalypse over here.\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse will premiere on FX on September 12.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Dibdin", "Emma Dibdin Writes About Television", "Movies", "Podcasts", "With Coverage Including Opinion Essays", "News Posts", "Episodic Reviews", "In-Depth Interviews With Creatives."], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a22853918/american-horror-story-apocalypse-emma-roberts-madison-montgomery-picture/", "title": "See The First Image of Emma Roberts' Return to American Horror Story", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "See The First Image of Emma Roberts' Return to American Horror Story", "description": "Surprise, bitch.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a22853918/american-horror-story-apocalypse-emma-roberts-madison-montgomery-picture/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-08-28 08:38:11", "published_time": "2018-08-28 07:39:00", "section": "Film, TV & Theatre", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "First Photo of Emma Roberts' Return to American Horror Story Apocalypse", "description": "Surprise, bitch.", "keywords": "ahs, ahs apocalypse, ahs season 8, american horror story, coven murder house crossover, ahs emma roberts, madison montgomery", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,film-tv", "sailthru.date": "2018-08-28T19:39:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-emma-roberts-ahs-index-1535488676.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "See The First Image of Emma Roberts' Return to American Horror Story", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535413140.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
