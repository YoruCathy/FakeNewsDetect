News.\n\nWhile at the launch of her collection for New York & Co, the mom-of-two, who has taken a step back from the public eye since welcoming her daughters, Esmeralda, 3, and Amada, 1, talked about how guilty she feels splitting her time between raising her and Ryan\u2019s girls.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cNobody warns you about the guilt that you feel when you do work!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I find balance,\u201d the clothing designer added, \u201cbecause I think it is like a day to day kind of struggle, you know?\u201d\n\nWhile Eva admits she\u2019s still figuring out the whole managing it all thing, she knows that setting aside time for herself is necessary. However, she said that doesn\u2019t take away her guilt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for obviously taking care of myself\u2014that\u2019s how I can take care of them of course\u2014but that guilt that is just kind of always there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Ugh, this is gonna be there forever now.'\u201d\n\nEva may be going through her own inner-struggle but her daughters couldn\u2019t be the wiser as the actress confessed that her 3-year-old \u201cis kind of oblivious that [she does] anything besides be her mom.\u201d\n\nThe clothing designer also dished on how her daughters are very different but still alike.\n\n\u201cThey are pretty opposite. They are both angels, they are just different kinds of angels,\u201d she laughed.\n\nCan you relate to Eva\u2019s mom guilt?
