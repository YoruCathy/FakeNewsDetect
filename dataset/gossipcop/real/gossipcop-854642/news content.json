So far, Freud's tweets seem to suggest there are plenty of surprises in store.\n\n\n\nOn set for #rednosedayactually and so longing to tweet photos but have been silenced.

I guess that\u2019s the big question \u2014 or is it so obviously Liam [Neeson]? We\u2019ve been delighted and grateful that so many of the cast are around and able to take part \u2014 and it\u2019ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later. We hope to make something that\u2019ll be fun and which we hope will help bring lots of viewers and cash to the Red Nose Day shows.\u201d\n\nRed Nose Day Actually will premiere on Mar. 24 in the U.K., and May 25 in the U.S.\n\nFollow Gina on Twitter.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Mei", "I'M Gina", "The Night Editor Here At Cosmopolitan.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a9095059/behind-the-scenes-red-nose-day-love-actually-sequel/", "title": "Here's Your First Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Love Actually Sequel", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Here's Your First Behind-the-Scenes Look at the \"Love Actually\" Sequel", "description": "The Prime Minister is back!", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a9095059/behind-the-scenes-red-nose-day-love-actually-sequel/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-03-16 05:50:44", "published_time": "2017-03-06 05:09:00", "section": "Movies", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Here's Your First Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Love Actually Sequel", "description": "The Prime Minister is back!", "keywords": "love actually, sequel, red nose day, red nose day actually, hugh grant, martine mccutcheon, emma freud", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.143xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,movies,comic relief,red nose day actually,red nose day,sequel", "sailthru.date": "2017-03-06T05:09:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/love-actually-1488776219.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.143xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Here's Your First Behind-the-Scenes Look at the \"Love Actually\" Sequel", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488748140.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
