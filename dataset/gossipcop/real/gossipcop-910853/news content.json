I don\u2019t follow protocol. And I will talk about WHAT I WANT. I requested a Dick Cavett free form hangout.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am unusual, that IS the point. I do not care for formats or traditional thought. Every interview of mine is different, just like a mood. A lot of you are meeting me for the first time. Don\u2019t compare me to what you would do or be. Be free,\u201d she said in another tweet.\n\n2) I am bored of formats and questions. I am done with traditional structure. If you\u2019re not with the fake tradition of traditional promotional \u201cappearances\u201d then by all means, stay in your square, but DO NOT APPLY TO ME . @TheAVClub \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) February 1, 2018\n\nI am unusual, that IS the point.
