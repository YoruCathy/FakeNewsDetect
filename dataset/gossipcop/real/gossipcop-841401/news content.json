You ain't seen nothin' yet. The Beverly Hills bunch is back for Season 9 on Tuesday, February 12 at 9/8c, and it's unlike anything you've ever seen before.\n\nForget what you've heard: What's really going down in the 90210 is even more \"crazy,\" \"epic,\" \"unbelievable,\" and \"shocking,\" according to the above trailer for the upcoming new season. Yes, the drama is the realest it's ever been on RHOBH, so you better buckle up.\n\nIn Season 9, we'll be welcoming back Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave, Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Lisa Vanderpump. There's also a new face coming into the mix, who's actually very familiar, Denise Richards. Camille Grammer will also be back as a friend to hang with her Hollywood pals. And did we see appearances by a couple of RHOBH alums in the trailer, too? Yeah, we did.\n\nThe RHOBH ladies will be bringing all their usual glam along the way, including gorgeous getaways, luxe gifts, and the fiercest outfits we ever did see. Oh, and we'll see not one but two weddings. Did we mention how amazing Season 9 of RHOBH is going to be?\n\nWatch how this group of dynamic women manages a season where they're at a crossroads in their careers, families, and especially their friendships. Changes are definitely afoot for these L.A. ladies.\n\nCheck out the full Season 9 trailer above, and then come back down here for some more RHOBH goodness.", "images": ["https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/last-chance-kitchen-playlist-promote.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/rhonj-season-10-aftershow.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/emily-simson-family-children-rhoc.jpg?itok=qD9_yrVe", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/396/830/181219_3849352_Your_First_Look_at_The_Real_Housewives_of_Be.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/11/dish-lisa-vanderpump_2.jpg?itok=xSIw1Ebu", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-todd-kaela-tucker.jpg?itok=EzzwdqqY", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/09/dish-denise-richards-rhobh.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/project-runway-season-18-aftershow.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-02/gage-edwards-home-construction-jeff.jpg?itok=gQnzHilg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/vanderpump-rules-aftershow-season-8.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/10/dish-kyle-richards_1.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/2020-03/rhobh-season-10-16x9-sans-logo.jpg?itok=ClfjwM2Q", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-02/rhoa-aftershow-playlist-promo_0.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/447/583/181119_3832590_The_Husbands_Crashed_a_Girls__Trip_to_Hawaii.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-throwback-picture-rhoa.jpg?itok=p5t7QGq7", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-02/mercedes-javid-golnesa-gg-baby.jpg?itok=FRVnbv9M", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/12/dish-rhobh-supertease.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/12/dish-rhobh-supertease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-season-9-premiere-date-trailer", "title": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Returns This February: Watch the Trailer You've All Been Waiting For", "meta_data": {"title": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 9 Premiere Date, Trailer | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "If you thought last season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills was jaw-dropping, just wait.
