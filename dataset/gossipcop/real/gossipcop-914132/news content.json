According to Us Weekly, the comedian tied the knot in a secret ceremony with her boyfriend, Chris Fischer, this week.\n\nThe star-studded wedding apparently took place on February 13, right before Valentine's Day, at a rented house in Malibu. Us Weekly says that a \"comedian officiated the nuptials,\" and a slew of celebrity guests attended, including Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lawrence and Judd Apatow.\n\nSchumer shared several photos on Instagram, including this cute snap with Lawrence:\n\nInstagram\n\nAccording to The Blast, Jake Gyllenhaal was also there, and the reception apparently \"featured a huge seafood bar where guests dined on oysters.\" There was a strict no-photos policy, though, so we're unlikely to see any snaps on social media.\n\nNews of Schumer's relationship with Fischer broke in November 2017, when they were spotted dining together at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso in New York.\n\nView this post on Instagram Yup A post shared by @ amyschumer on Feb 15, 2018 at 8:53am PST\n\nFellow comedian, Bridget Everett, told Us Weekly in December that her best friend Schumer was in a new relationship. She said, \"I won\u2019t say anything other than I\u2019m happy that Amy\u2019s very happy.\"\n\nSchumer appeared to confirm her relationship with Fischer by sharing photos of him on Instagram, including this snap of them kissing at Ellen DeGeneres' 60th birthday party:\n\nUs Weekly reports that Fischer's sister is Schumer's assistant, so that's likely how the couple first met. Fischer runs his family's Beetlebung Farm in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, and released the award-winning in 2015.\n\n\n\nPrior to getting married, Schumer dated Ben Hanisch, who she met on a dating app in November 2015. The relationship ended in May 2017.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/amy-schumer-1518717535.jpg?crop=0.9989764585465711xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/amy-schumer-1518717535.jpg?crop=0.9989764585465711xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a18194997/amy-schumer-married-secret-wedding-chris-fischer/", "title": "Amy Schumer Just Got Married in a Secret Wedding to Chef Chris Fischer", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Amy Schumer Just Got Married in a Secret Wedding to Chef Chris Fischer", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence and Jennifer Aniston were there.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a18194997/amy-schumer-married-secret-wedding-chris-fischer/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/amy-schumer-1518717535.jpg?crop=0.9989764585465711xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2019-10-21 03:53:34", "published_time": "2018-02-15 04:42:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/amy-schumer-1518717535.jpg?crop=0.9989764585465711xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Amy Schumer Secret Wedding to Chris Fischer - Amy Schumer Marries Chris Fischer in Surprise Wedding", "description": "Amy Schumer got married to her boyfriend chef Chris Fischer in Malibu on Tuesday.
