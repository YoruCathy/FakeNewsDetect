Photo: Warner Bros/Twentieth Century Fox/FX/Nick Briggs/BBC America\n\nIt\u2019s time for the Golden Globes, the only televised awards show that hands out trophies for movies and TV and airs on NBC in January! The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announces its nominations on Thursday morning \u2014 as we wait with bated breath to find out who will be lucky enough to enjoy a sloshed evening on someone else\u2019s dime, here are Vulture\u2019s 2019 Golden Globe predictions in both TV and film.\n\nBest Television Series: Drama\n\nWith three of the five dramas nominated last year \u2014 The Crown, Game of Thrones, and Stranger Things \u2014 all out of contention in 2018, that opens up the category to some potential new entries.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press was right on top of Sam Esmail\u2019s Mr. Robot, nominating it in its first season, so I fully expect it to give the same treatment to Esmail\u2019s excellent Homecoming, especially with a star as big as Julia Roberts at the helm. In addition to being one of the year\u2019s buzziest, most addictive series, Killing Eve is also a British-made series, and that may carry extra sway with U.K. voters. Same goes for Bodyguard, the biggest drama-series hit in England in years, even though it landed on Netflix in the U.S. with a bit less fanfare. Given the Globes\u2019 track record with Ryan Murphy shows (Glee won for outstanding TV comedy twice, and the limited series/TV movie category has featured a Murphy outing every year for the past five years), it seems more than fair to assume that [Billy Porter voice] the category is \u2026 also going to include Pose.\n\nWhich leaves room for one more drama. It could be last year\u2019s winner, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale; This Is Us, also nominated last year; fan-favorite The Haunting of Hill House; or The Americans, which has been criminally overlooked by the HFPA in this field every year that it\u2019s been on the air. I think this could go a number of different ways, but I am going to give Globe voters the benefit of the doubt and assume that they\u2019ll finally rectify their very wrong shunning of the Jennings family.\n\nPredicted nominees: The Americans, Bodyguard, Homecoming, Killing Eve, Pose\n\nBest Television Series: Musical or Comedy\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel was named Best Comedy at last year\u2019s Globes and at this year\u2019s Emmys, so I can\u2019t imagine it being passed over for a nomination here. Add Atlanta back into the competition, too, which qualifies in the race again after taking a year off. Black-ish has been nominated for the past two years, but I can imagine voters moving away from that ABC sitcom to let some new shows into the mix. Kidding, the Showtime series about the grieving children\u2019s show host played by Jim Carrey, strikes me as the sort of series that could bump Black-ish. (The Globes voters love Carrey \u2014 more on this shortly.)\n\nThe HFPA relishes any chance to get ahead of the Emmys, which means that this is also a great time for it to finally recognize the genius of The Good Place. GLOW, which found an even stronger sense of voice in season two, is also a likely candidate for inclusion, given the nomination Alison Brie received for her performance last year. But what about Murphy Brown? In that Candice Bergen comedy\u2019s heyday, it was nominated five times and took the top prize once. Globe voters made a point of honoring Will & Grace last year for its revival. They could do the same with Murphy Brown. But since the general public reaction to Murphy has been a bit muted, they may ignore it.\n\nPredicted nominees: Atlanta, GLOW, The Good Place, Kidding, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nBest Miniseries or TV Film\n\nAs I see it, there are seven top contenders in this category: The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, Escape at Dannemora, Maniac, Sharp Objects, Patrick Melrose, A Very English Scandal, and The Little Drummer Girl. The first four seem like locks, given their quality and the caliber of talent involved. I feel like Patrick Melrose will be perceived as more of a showcase for Benedict Cumberbatch, who will earn a nomination. And in a battle between A Very English Scandal, the BBC mini-series picked up in the States by Amazon, and The Little Drummer Girl, another BBC entry that aired very recently on AMC, I suspect A Very English Scandal may have the edge. I also suspect that I could be dead wrong. Nevertheless \u2026\n\nPredicted nominees: The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, Escape at Dannemora, Maniac, A Very English Scandal, Sharp Objects\n\nBest Actor in a TV Drama\n\nSterling K. Brown won the Globe last year and he\u2019ll definitely compete again for his role as Randall on This Is Us. Other actors who will probably be nominated again this year: Jason Bateman, who landed a nod for Ozark last year and two previous times for Arrested Development; and Matthew Rhys, who won an Emmy earlier this year but who has only been nominated for the Globe once, two years ago, for his work on The Americans. There are all kinds of directions voters could go to fill out the field: They could nominate J.K. Simmons for his dual roles on Counterpart, or Milo Ventimiglia for This Is Us, since Jack\u2019s experience in the Crock-Pot fire didn\u2019t air until this year. Or they could go with Game of Thrones alum Richard Madden for Bodyguard, Kevin Costner for his work on Yellowstone, Stephan James for his subtle turn on Homecoming, or John Krasinski for taking over Jack Ryan duties on Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan. It\u2019s a wide-open field, so take your pick.\n\nPredicted nominees: Jason Bateman (Ozark), Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us), Kevin Costner (Yellowstone), Richard Madden (Bodyguard), Matthew Rhys, (The American)\n\nBest Actress in a TV Drama\n\nLet\u2019s try to imagine the HFPA not nominating Julia Roberts for her first starring role in a regular television series \u2026 nope, can\u2019t do it. Roberts has been nominated eight times for her film roles, and she\u2019s won three Globes. Mark her down in this field in permanent ink. Joining her will likely be Elisabeth Moss, who won last year for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. That leaves a tough choice: Killing Eve stars Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer; Keri Russell, whom the Globes have recognized for playing Elizabeth Jennings just once before; and Robin Wright, who took over as star of House of Cards under especially challenging circumstances. This is another tough one, but my guess is that the list will shake out with a lot of love for Eve \u2014 and not so much for Russell, unfortunately.\n\nPredicted nominees: Jodie Comer (Killing Eve), Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale), Sandra Oh (Killing Eve), Julia Roberts (Homecoming), Robin Wright (House of Cards)\n\nBest Actor in a TV Comedy\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press loves big movie stars. It definitely loves Jim Carrey, who has been nominated six times, won twice, and will undoubtedly score another nod for his TV comeback on Kidding. Similarly, I don\u2019t think the HFPA would dare not to nominate eight-time nominee, two-time winner, and Cecil B. DeMille Award recipient Michael Douglas for his role in Netflix\u2019s The Kominsky Method. Other shoo-ins: Donald Glover for Atlanta, who won in this category two years ago, and Barry\u2019s Bill Hader, who took home this year\u2019s Emmy for his portrayal of a conflicted hit man. The remaining question: Will two-time nominee Anthony Anderson get another nod for Black-ish, or will Ted Danson\u2019s Good Place demon slide in and snag that last spot? Given the Globes\u2019 tendency to embrace what\u2019s a little more fresh, I\u2019m leaning toward Danson.\n\nPredicted nominees: Jim Carrey (Kidding), Ted Danson, (The Good Place), Michael Douglas (The Kominsky Method), Donald Glover (Atlanta), Bill Hader (Barry)\n\nBest Actress in a TV Comedy\n\nAside from another nomination for Rachel Brosnahan, who won last year for her performance in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, nothing seems 100 percent certain in this category. I feel fairly confident that Alison Brie will get nominated again for GLOW, particularly since her role in season two confronted some thorny #MeToo issues. The other three nominations could go to Maya Rudolph, who delivers the standout performance in Forever; Issa Rae, previously nominated for Insecure; Jennifer Garner, a big name who is the most delightful part of HBO\u2019s Camping; or, in keeping with potential heavy HFPA support for The Good Place, Kristen Bell.\n\nHere\u2019s where I landed, with the caveat that Rae could easily still squeeze out Bell or Garner.\n\nPredicted nominees: Kristen Bell (The Good Place), Alison Brie (GLOW), Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Maya Rudolph (Forever), Jennifer Garner (Camping)\n\nBest Actor in a Miniseries or TV Film\n\nIt\u2019s a tight race this year, but it\u2019ll certainly include Emmy winner Darren Criss from The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, Hugh Grant for A Very British Scandal, and Benedict Cumberbatch for his all-in performance of an addict in Patrick Melrose. From there, it\u2019s a toss-up between Jonah Hill for Maniac, Benicio del Toro for Escape at Dannemora, and John Legend for becoming our Lord and Savior in NBC\u2019s live staging of Jesus Christ Superstar. As always, keep in mind the HFPA\u2019s love of established film stars.\n\nPredicted nominees: Darren Criss (The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story), Benedict Cumberbatch (Patrick Melrose), Jonah Hill (Maniac), Hugh Grant (A Very British Scandal), Benicio del Toro (Escape at Dannemora)\n\nBest Actress in a Miniseries or TV Film\n\nIf Amy Adams doesn\u2019t get nominated for Sharp Objects, I will drink any poison that Patricia Clarkson whips up and forces me to consume. Translation: I\u2019m confident that she\u2019s getting nominated. I feel the same way about Patricia Arquette\u2019s full-body transformation into Tilly Mitchell in Escape at Dannemora, as well as Emma Stone\u2019s genre and subconscious-spanning turn in Maniac. From there, things get dicier. Regina King, who won this year\u2019s Emmy for her work in Netflix\u2019s Seven Seconds, should get a nomination, along with Laura Dern for The Tale. But the Golden Globes has a tendency to throw one wild card into the mix, and I\u2019m guessing that may happen here. Even if The Little Drummer Girl doesn\u2019t get nominated for best mini-series, I think the HFPA will want to show some love to that limited work, and may do so via its star, Florence Pugh.\n\nPredicted nominees: Amy Adams, (Sharp Objects), Patricia Arquette (Escape at Dannemora), Laura Dern (The Tale), Florence Pugh (The Little Drummer Girl), Emma Stone (Maniac)\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film\n\nThere is one definite lock in this category and that\u2019s Henry Winkler, who won the Emmy for his portrayal of Gene Cousineau on Barry and will almost certainly be nominated for a Golden Globe as well. Other potential contenders: Tony Shalhoub for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Edgar Ramirez for The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Ben Whishaw for A Very English Scandal, Alan Arkin for The Kominsky Method; Brian Tyree Henry for Atlanta, and Joseph Fiennes for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Even though Shalhoub wasn\u2019t nominated last year, his previous Globe track record \u2014 he was nominated five times for Monk, and won once \u2014 should put him in the mix this year. Support for both The Assassination of Gianni Versace and A Very English Scandal should translate into nods for Ramirez and Whishaw. (Actors who appear in limited series or TV movies traditionally do well in this broad-brush category.) And I\u2019m going to call that last slot for Brian Tyree Henry who, in addition to doing stand-out work on Atlanta this season, has also done some fine film work this year that will likely raise his profile in the eyes of HFPA members.\n\nPredicted nominees: Edgar Ramirez (The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story), Tony Shalhoub (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta), Ben Whishaw (A Very English Scandal), Henry Winkler (Barry)\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film\n\nI believe Ann Dowd, nominated last year for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, will repeat that feat this year. Alex Borstein\u2019s Emmy win for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel should bolster her case for a Golden Globe nod as well. I\u2019ll be very surprised if Patricia Clarkson isn\u2019t nominated for Sharp Objects, and I suspect Pen\u00e9lope Cruz will have enough support among HFPA members to be recognized for her work in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. That leaves one opening that could conceivably go to Judith Light for The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Emmy winner Thandie Newton for Westworld, Betty Gilpin for GLOW, Zazie Beetz for Atlanta, Yvonne Strahovski for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, or Chrissy Metz for This Is Us. I think it\u2019s going to break Newton\u2019s way.\n\nPredicted nominees: Alex Borstein (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Patricia Clarkson (Sharp Objects), Pen\u00e9lope Cruz (The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story), Ann Dowd (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale), Thandie Newton (Westworld)\n\nBest Motion Picture, Drama\n\nRoma is ineligible here because of an arcane HFPA rule that says foreign-language films can\u2019t also compete in the Best Picture categories. That opens up a field that was in danger of getting very crowded after A Star Is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody, and Can You Ever Forgive Me? all decided to run as dramas. Of those, I think the Globes will smile on ASIB and BoRhap, two big, popular hits that may entrance voters who love it when someone puts on a show. And if freakin\u2019 Deadpool can get a Globe nomination, I see no reason why Black Panther can\u2019t as well.\n\nI can\u2019t quite get a finger on BlacKkKlansman, which has only garnered a handful of nominations for Adam Driver. And if, as rumored, the HFPA doesn\u2019t love Black Panther, a lower-key movie like Can You Ever Forgive Me? could sneak in.\n\nPredicted nominees: If Beale Street Could Talk, Black Panther, Bohemian Rhapsody, First Man, A Star Is Born\n\nBest Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nThe lack of Freddie Mercury and Jackson Maine means plenty of room for all manner of comedies here, from scabrous satires (Vice, The Favourite) to humane crowd-pleasers (Crazy Rich Asians, Green Book). But the heavyweight is probably Mary Poppins Returns, which suddenly has the singing-and-dancing lane all to itself. Can you imagine that?\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that the Globes went for Lady Bird in a major way last year, handing Greta Gerwig\u2019s dramedy four nods. Will the similarly warm-hearted Eighth Grade follow in its footsteps, or those of The Big Sick, another summer comedy that got blanked at the Globes?\n\nPredicted nominees: Crazy Rich Asians, The Favourite, Green Book, Mary Poppins Returns, Vice\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama\n\nIn Glenn Close, Lady Gaga, and Melissa McCarthy, this category contains three of the four women thought to be leading the Oscar race. The other two spots are up for grabs: Will it be Ben Is Back\u2019s Julia Roberts, Destroyer\u2019s Nicole Kidman, Widows\u2019 Viola Davis, Roma\u2019s Yalitza Aparicio, or \u2014 be still my heart \u2014 Natalie Portman\u2019s Noo Yawk Pop Stah in Vox Lux? I have the Globes going for Aparicio and Roberts, getting both newcomer cred and someone super famous who can sit at the front table. (Voters do love Kidman, but I think she\u2019s stronger in Best Supporting Actress.)\n\nPredicted nominees: Yalitza Aparicio (Roma), Glenn Close (The Wife), Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born), Melissa McCarthy (Can You Ever Forgive Me?), Julia Roberts (Ben Is Back)\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nEmily Blunt and Olivia Colman face off in a battle of stern British women who yell at children. Further down the ballot, things get a little interesting, as voters have the opportunity to highlight a selection of movies that have been slightly outside the mainstream awards conversation, including Tully and Crazy Rich Asians. Kathryn Hahn could make it in if the HFPA goes for Private Life in a big way. Or, to take things in an even indier direction, what about Regina Hall of Support the Girls?\n\nPredicted nominees: Emily Blunt (Mary Poppins Returns), Olivia Colman (The Favourite), Elsie Fisher (Eighth Grade), Charlize Theron (Tully), Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians)\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama\n\nTwo musicians \u2014 one deep-voiced and fictional; the other real, with God- and tooth-given range \u2014 lead the way here, with Ethan Hawke riding a wave of wins from critics\u2019 ceremonies to a nomination of his own. And though First Man has had an underwhelming reception so far, I don\u2019t think the HFPA will be able to resist the gravitational pull of Ryan Gosling, a winner two years ago. Steve Carell\u2019s odds might be longer, but it\u2019s worth noting that the Globes have generally not passed up a chance to reward the actor when he\u2019s in \u201cplease gimme an Oscar\u201d mode.\n\nThe Globes have a track record of appreciating Julian Schnabel, a Best Director winner for The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, so despite the fallow reception for At Eternity\u2019s Gate, two-time nominee Willem Dafoe could wind up joining the HFPA\u2019s starry night.\n\nPredicted nominees: Steve Carell (Beautiful Boy), Bradley Cooper (A Star Is Born), Ryan Gosling (First Man), Ethan Hawke (First Reformed), Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody)\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nPaul Giamatti has been submitting himself in Supporting Actor for Private Life, but the Globes overruled him and bumped him up to the main category. A sign that it likes the movie enough to care where it places? I don\u2019t think the Globes will pass up the chance to honor Robert Redford for what the actor says is his final film role. And Ryan Reynolds scoring a second nomination for the Deadpool franchise is just the kind of crazy you can expect from the Globes.\n\nIf the Globes go Poppins-crazy, Lin-Manuel Miranda could tag along with a nomination here. And Carell may sneak in here for Welcome to Marwen instead.\n\nPredicted nominees: Christian Bale (Vice), Paul Giamatti (Private Life), Viggo Mortensen (Green Book), Robert Redford (The Old Man & the Gun), Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool 2)\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\n\nThis race seems to have narrowed down to a top four of Mahershala Ali, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Sam Elliott, and Richard E. Grant. Who will nab the final spot? I\u2019m going with last year\u2019s winner Sam Rockwell, whose gonzo George W. Bush impression in Vice seems on the HFPA\u2019s wavelength. BlacKkKlansman\u2019s Adam Driver and Black Panther\u2019s Michael B. Jordan are both orbiting this category as well, but neither has gotten much love from the Globes in the past: Driver was never nominated for Girls, while Jordan was snubbed for the first Creed three years ago. Will this be the year it turns around for them?\n\nPredicted nominees: Mahershala Ali (Green Book), Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (Beautiful Boy), Sam Elliott (A Star Is Born), Richard E. Grant (Can You Ever Forgive Me?), Sam Rockwell (Vice)\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\n\nThis category offers a nice test case of whether all three Favourite actresses can score nominations. I think the HFPA might spread the wealth around, preferring instead someone like Boy Erased\u2019s Nicole Kidman, a Globes fave. (She\u2019s been nominated 12 times, with four wins.) And I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll overlook Regina King, who\u2019s been taking home this trophy at every ceremony so far, or Claire Foy, a past Globe winner for The Crown.\n\nBut voters do like Rachel Weisz, having thrown her a nomination for The Deep Blue Sea (not that one) after her win for Constant Gardener. And a nod for Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 Michelle Yeoh would be fun.\n\nPredicted nominees: Amy Adams (Vice), Claire Foy (First Man), Nicole Kidman (Boy Erased), Regina King (If Beale Street Could Talk), Emma Stone (The Favourite)\n\nBest Director, Motion Picture\n\nOnly two of the Globes\u2019 directing nominees made it into Oscar\u2019s final five in 2018; looking at the three men the HFPA preferred \u2014 Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Martin McDonagh \u2014 offers a hint at its taste. It likes well-respected white guys! That\u2019s why I see the Globes this year going with its favorite wunderkind Damien Chazelle, as well as Peter Farrelly, a comedy director going (slightly) serious, and Rob Marshall \u2014 because musicals.\n\nIf you find that you can easily recall last year\u2019s directing category at the Globes, that\u2019s probably because Natalie Portman chided the Globes onstage for its all-male slate. If voters took her words to heart, honoring Marielle Heller\u2019s nuanced work on Can You Ever Forgive Me? offers a chance for a course correction. Barry Jenkins probably has a better shot at an Oscar nomination (though he did get a Globe nom for Moonlight), while a Spike Lee nod for BlacKkKlansman could seriously boost his fortunes. Adam McKay for Vice is also a possibility, but he did get passed over in this category for The Big Short, which people seem to like better than Vice.\n\nPredicted nominees: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Roma), Bradley Cooper (A Star Is Born), Peter Farrelly (Green Book), Rob Marshall (Mary Poppins Returns), Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite)", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/04/04-golden-globes-noms-predix.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/04/04-golden-globes-noms-predix.w700.h467.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/04/04-golden-globes-noms-predix.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jen Chaney", "Nate Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/golden-globes-2019-predictions-for-nominations-tv-and-film.html", "title": "Which TV Shows and Movies Will Be Nominated for the 2019 Golden Globes?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Which TV Shows and Movies Will Be Nominated for the 2019 Golden Globes?", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/golden-globes-2019-predictions-for-nominations-tv-and-film.html", "description": "Vulture\u2019s picks in all major categories.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/04/04-golden-globes-noms-predix.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "What Will Get Nominated at the Golden Globes This Year?", "description": "Vulture\u2019s picks in all major categories.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/04/04-golden-globes-noms-predix.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@chaneyj", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-04T15:43:31.300-05:00", "tag": "2019 golden globes, golden globes 2019, awards, movies, tv, vulture homepage lede, golden globes", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Vulture\u2019s Golden Globes 2019 predictions cover all the nominations in the major categories for TV and movies.", "sailthru.tags": "2019 golden globes, golden globes 2019, awards, movies, tv, vulture homepage lede, golden globes", "author": "Jen Chaney, Nate Jones", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543956211.3, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
