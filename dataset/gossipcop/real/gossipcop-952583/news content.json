Is there such a thing as the Royal Urban Dictionary?\n\nQEII might not be able to define troll, but it seems the 92-year-old monarch may be well-versed in executing it. And her victim might have been one Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe president, of course, paid Queen Elizabeth a visit last week at Windsor Castle during his controversial visit to London, where hundreds of thousands of Brits took to the streets to protest his presence.\n\nTrump, who was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, didn\u2019t exactly endear himself to the queen when he broke protocol and walked ahead of her. Video of the breach of etiquette went viral.\n\nBritain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth walks around US President Donald Trump as they inspect the guard at Windsor Castle pic.twitter.com/2DWfIlTeMT \u2014 RT\u00c9 News (@rtenews) July 13, 2018\n\nThe Trumps were also late for their scheduled tea with the queen. Bloody hell!\n\nBut it seems Her Royal Highness might have gotten revenge preemptively. According to E!News, Queen Elizabeth wore different brooches during Trump\u2019s three days in the United Kingdom, with each broach having special significance, as described on the blog From Her Majesty\u2019s Jewel Vault.\n\nA Twitter user who goes by the handle @SamuraiKnitter tweeted extensively about the \u201cbrooch warfare.\u201d\n\nQueen Elizabeth \u201cdoes hundreds and hundreds of appearances, and maybe 95% or high, she wears a brooch. And the brooch is ALWAYS significant. Badges of military regiments \u2013 she inspects some troops, she wears the badge of them to do it,\u201d @SamuraiKnitter wrote.\n\nQE also does hundreds and hundreds of appearances, and maybe 95% or higher, she wears a brooch.

The brooch was not a state gift, according to @SamuraiKnitter, as the Obamas paid for it themselves.\n\n\u201cThe US has given QE jewelry before over the years and I bet her dresser could put hands on any and all of it given five minutes,\u201d said @SamuraiTwitter. \u201cBut she chose the most SENTIMENTAL piece in the collection, the one that was given OUT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OBAMAS AS PEOPLE.\u201d\n\nThe US has given QE jewelry before over the years and I bet her dresser could put hands on any and all of it given five minutes.
