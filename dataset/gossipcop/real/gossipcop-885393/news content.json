{"url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/blade-runner-2049-review-1202576220/", "text": "The world as we know it has nearly caught up to the one Ridley Scott imagined when he directed the 2019-set \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and yet, for all the influence the dystopian cult favorite has had on other sci-fi movies, Scott\u2019s vision of Los Angeles still looks as mind-blowingly futuristic now as it did in 1982. That may well explain why its sequel, the Denis Villeneuve-directed \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d doesn\u2019t feel the need to reinvent the world in which it takes place, but instead is free to delve deep into the existential concerns suggested by the earlier film, as screenwriters Hampton Fancher (who also co-wrote the original) and Michael Green raise evocative questions about human-android relations and the nuances that will one day be used to tell them apart.\n\nSure as it is to delight \u201cBlade Runner\u201d fans, this stunningly elegant follow-up doesn\u2019t depend on having seen the original \u2014 and like 2010\u2019s \u201cTron: Legacy,\u201d may actually play better to those who aren\u2019t wedded to the franchise\u2019s muddled off-screen mythology. As it happens, in both tone and style, the new film owes more to slow-cinema maestro Andrei Tarkovsky than it does to Scott\u2019s revolutionary cyberpunk sensibility. In fact, at 2 hours and 44 minutes, \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d clocks in at three minutes longer than the austere Russian auteur\u2019s \u201cStalker.\u201d But Villeneuve earns every second of that running time, delivering a visually breathtaking, long-fuse action movie whose unconventional thrills could be described as many things \u2014 from tantalizing to tedious \u2014 but never \u201cartificially intelligent.\u201d\n\nWhereas it took five different versions for Ridley Scott to satisfyingly answer the question raised by Philip K. Dick\u2019s speculative-fiction novel, \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u201d (four of which suggest the director himself didn\u2019t quite recognize what was most fascinating about his own film), Villeneuve gets it right on his first attempt, operating from the premise that when androids dream, their innermost desire is to be human. Following that thread to its natural conclusion, Villeneuve has crafted a slick, 21st-century Pinocchio story, in which a replicant yearns to be a real boy \u2014 although that\u2019s just one facet of the film\u2019s many dimensions. Make no mistake: Whereas the original \u201cBlade Runner\u201d was (eventually) embraced for its unrealized potential, its sequel ranks as one of the great science-fiction films of all time.\n\nTogether with DP Roger Deakins (in the most spectacular of their three collaborations) and a gifted team of design artists (led by \u201cSpectre\u201d production designer Dennis Gassner), Villeneuve offers a bracing vision of where humankind is headed, iconically lit in amber, neon hues and stark fluorescent white. Those are not necessarily the colors one associates with film noir. But then, \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d could hardly be considered a conventional example of the style, using its obligatory blaster-pistol shootouts and gymnastic hand-to-hand combat (nods to the original) to lend excitement to its more profound philosophical agenda \u2014 aided by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer\u2019s atmospheric score, which features a few nice synth jazz stretches, but leans more on bass-vibrating Dolby flatulence than what might typically be called music.\n\nJust as Villeneuve did with his previous feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cArrival,\u201d whose piercingly emotional core elevated its pulp alien-invasion premise, in \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d he subverts the genre in favor of a rich inquiry into the nature of the soul itself. The film\u2019s true concerns are perhaps best illustrated by a superficially kinky, yet surprisingly tender three-way sex scene between a human, a replicant and a state-of-the-art companion hologram as each of the parties seeks its own desired form of connection.\n\nComing to the world of blockbusters from an art cinema background, Villeneuve doesn\u2019t deal in the conventional idea of suspense, where a difficult goal must be achieved on an imminent deadline; rather, he operates via a kind of dramatic suspension, in which he challenges attention-deficit audiences to adapt to his unnaturally attenuated pace. Certainly, if anything has changed in the almost three decades since \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d it\u2019s the speed at which modern people are expected to process things, and yet, in \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d the simplest actions take an impossibly long time (consider the almost sadistically drawn-out sequence in which a key character retrieves a personal object from a long-ago hiding place, fulfilling an expectation audiences have put together minutes earlier).\n\nAs the film opens, the year, of course, is 2049. Sea levels have risen, air quality has worsened and unchecked waste has turned everything south of Los Angeles into a seemingly horizonless scrap heap (San Diego is literally a dump). But apart from that, the world hasn\u2019t changed that much in the 30 years since we last saw Harrison Ford\u2019s Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter tasked with \u201cretiring\u201d renegade android slaves \u2014 or \u201cskin jobs\u201d \u2014 who realized in that film\u2019s final scene that he might be one as well (depending on whom you believe, and which version you watch).\n\n\u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d lays the debate to rest, focusing on a younger and unequivocally robotic model, officer KD6-3.7 (Ryan Gosling). Considerably bulked up since last year\u2019s \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the naturally charismatic Gosling is back in the somewhat off-putting zero-emotion mode of \u201cDrive\u201d and \u201cOnly God Forgives,\u201d channeling the nihilistic cool Alain Delon demonstrated in hit-man masterpiece \u201cLe Samoura\u00ef\u201d to create a character who\u2019s every bit as cool, and twice as inscrutable.\n\nUndeniably handsome though he is, there\u2019s always been something amiss in Gosling\u2019s closely spaced, slightly misaligned eyes, suggesting a \u201csynthetic\u201d human who\u2019s 99% perfect, but still just a bit off. That subtle flaw serves the actor well as \u201cK,\u201d a rule-abiding Blade Runner who takes orders from plausibly tough LAPD Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Putting her \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d severity to excellent use, Wright is the standout in an all-around terrific (and largely female) supporting cast. (With any luck, a small but impactful role from Israeli-Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass could draw attention to her performance in \u201cIn Syria.\u201d)\n\nGoing through with a routine mission to apprehend/eliminate an early-model Nexus-8, K makes a startling discovery \u2014 one that threatens to undermine the delicate sense of order between humans and the now million-fold class of android slaves. As it is, the replicants\u2019 submission depends on their built-in expiration dates and the understanding that they were created to serve their masters. Any number of things could throw this system into turmoil, though Joshi has reason to fear that this one will incite a replicant uprising, and so orders K to destroy the evidence.\n\nExcept K disobeys, returning to the remote protein farm where the opening fight took place and discovering there a clue that ties him to characters from the original film (whereas the signature object in \u201cBlade Runner\u201d was an origami unicorn, here it\u2019s a carved wooden horse). Still, the links are hazy, since a huge electromagnetic pulse wiped out nearly all digital records a quarter-century earlier \u2014 the so-called \u201cBlackout\u201d of 2022 \u2014 forcing K to do some old-fashioned sleuthing that will lead him to Deckard himself, hiding out in what remains of the city of Las Vegas.\n\nVilleneuve and Deakins outdo themselves in depicting the topography and skylines of a vastly transformed western United States \u2014 a now-grungy country whose government has clearly been co-opted by its most powerful business interests, while its citizens are distracted in the pursuit of their own pleasure (as depicted by body-objectifying advertisements and sculptures, reminiscent of \u201cA.I.\u2019s\u201d hyper-sexualized Rouge City). Practically all-powerful in 2019, the Tyrell Corporation went bankrupt less than a decade later, and is now controlled by a reclusive scientist named Niander Wallace (chameleonic Jared Leto, who here assumes a burly beard and Nick Offerman-like accent to match, not to mention milky eyes and an elaborate levitating-camera system to supply his vision).\n\nFrom his ultra-modern corporate lair, Wallace is forever trying to innovate replicant technology, referring to his creations \u2014 including his ruthless favorite, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) \u2014 as his \u201cangels,\u201d and hoping to engineer one with that most dangerous ability of all. In a world where man plays god, the ultimate goal \u2014 or \u201cmiracle\u201d \u2014 would be giving these synthetic humans the power to reproduce themselves. (As it happens, that preoccupation with A.I. attempting to create life also serves as the central theme of Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cAlien\u201d prequels, where the underlying phobia has to do with humans engineering androids with the potential to surpass them.)\n\nThe scientific particulars of \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d are only nominally interesting, whereas its science-fiction framework allows for audiences to interpret the allegory as they see fit. Certainly, there\u2019s an obvious parallel to past slave-holding societies, in which the dominant race or class has cited its dubious superiority in order to rationalize the harsh treatment of so-called \u201csub-humans.\u201d Again, K knows he\u2019s a replicant, but also imagines himself as something of a Christ figure in a godless world. But then, when dealing with replicants, from Deckard to the Sean Young character he detected decades ago, hasn\u2019t the issue always been their uncanny ability to delude themselves?\n\nThat\u2019s where K\u2019s designed-for-his-pleasure hologram Joi (Cuban actress Ana de Armas) comes in: She\u2019s relatively new to the whole A.I. game, programmed to be submissive, and yet, Villeneuve devotes a significant portion of the film to observing the process by which she attempts to establish her own identity and emotions. Opposite Gosling\u2019s almost entirely blank-faced performance, Joi effectively represents the soul of the film \u2014 as do Luv, in her own misguided way, and \u201cWetlands\u201d star Carla Juri, as a \u201cmemory maker\u201d of mysterious provenance. It\u2019s perhaps the central irony of \u201cBlade Runner 2049,\u201d which depicts a future where humans have gone astray, while new-and-improved androids know precisely what they want: to be human.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blade-runner-20492.jpg?w=1000", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ffilm%2Freviews%2Fblade-runner-2049-review-1202576220%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202576220&comment_count=86", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blade-runner-20492.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Debruge"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/blade-runner-2049-review-1202576220/", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Blade Runner 2049\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "'Arrival' director Denis Villeneuve picks up 30 years after the cult classic left off, diving deep into the existential concerns of androids", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202576220, "author": "Peter Debruge", "pmc-category": "Reviews", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-09-29T06:00:52"}, "pmc-tag": "Blade Runner 2049,Denis Villeneuve,Ryan Gosling", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Blade Runner 2049\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film", "pmc-primary-category": "Reviews", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Blade Runner 2049\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/blade-runner-2049-review-1202576220/", "description": "The world as we know it has nearly caught up to the one Ridley Scott imagined when he directed the 2019-set \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and yet, for all the influence the dystopian cult favorite has had on oth\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blade-runner-20492.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Blade Runner 2049"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-29T13:00:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-29T13:11:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@https://twitter.com/askdebruge?lang=en", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "Film Review: \u2018Blade Runner 2049\u2019"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blade-runner-20492.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "Blade Runner 2049"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Blade Runner 2049\u2019", "description": "'Arrival' director Denis Villeneuve picks up 30 years after the cult classic left off, diving deep into the existential concerns of androids"}, "author": "Peter Debruge", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202576220, "title": "Film Review: 'Blade Runner 2049'", "published_at": "2017-09-29 06:00:52", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blade-runner-20492.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 86, "tags": "Ryan Gosling", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "The world as we know it has nearly caught up to the one Ridley Scott imagined when he directed the 2019-set \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and yet, for all the influence the dystopian cult favorite has had on other sci-fi movies, Scott\u2019s vision of Los Angeles still looks as mind-blowingly futuristic now as it did in 1982.
