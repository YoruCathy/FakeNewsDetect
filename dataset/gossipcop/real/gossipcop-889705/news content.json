Following Foy\u2019s Emmy best actress win for her role in the Netflix drama, expectations are high for Oscar winner Colman\u2019s performance.\n\nAfter a prolonged search, Tobias Menzies joined the show in March 2018 as Prince Philip, replacing Matt Smith. With Claire Foy and Matt Smith now gone, the drama is about to move into a new era both with a rebooted cast and with time moving forward in this epic story of the most famous family on the planet.\n\nGet all the latest Crown news and views direct to your inbox Sign up to receive our newsletter!

He was deeply in love with Camilla and forced to marry Diana.\u201d\n\nOn top of this, the series will see the monarch cultivating her steadiest relationship with a Prime Minister yet in Harold Wilson, who served as head of the British government during this period.\n\nNew star Tobias Menzies revealed to RadioTimes.com that the series will include an episode on the Apollo 11 moon landing, and how Prince Philip reacted to the momentous event in history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been shooting a really interesting episode which was all tied into the moon landings in \u201969,\u201d he revealed.\n\n\u201c[Showrunner] Peter [Morgan] has taken this angle that Philip gets very absorbed by the heroism of these men compared to what maybe he hasn\u2019t done with his own life.\u201d\n\nSeries three should also cover Prince Charles\u2019 movement into the public eye following his coronation as the Prince of Wales in 1969.\n\nJosh O\u2019Connor, who plays the young prince, says the new series introduces Charles while he is still a student.\n\n\u201cWe start off with Charles at Cambridge University, that\u2019s where we bring him into the series,\u201d he told RadioTimes.com. \u201cThis is where we scale a significant part of his life which I feel so honoured and excited to tell the story. And tell a very different side of the story that we may not have seen or have known about.\u201d\n\nIs there a trailer for The Crown?\n\nYes! We now have our first full trailer. Check it out below.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a shorter teaser:\n\nWho is in the cast of The Crown?\n\nThe Queen: Olivia Colman was the first new cast member announced \u2013 she replaces Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nNetflix has seemingly struck gold with the casting, especially after Colman won the Oscar for playing a different queen in 2018 film The Favourite.\n\nShe told RadioTimes.com about the moment when she knew she was in the running for the role.\n\n\u201cI got a phone call from my agent when I was in a car [telling her that she had been asked to meet with director Peter Morgan],\u201d she said. \u201cI think I had fairly recently finished watching the first series, which I think I had done in about three nights \u2013 and so I was very excited. My agent was trying to be subtle, not knowing who was in the car with me and she went, \u2018It\u2019s something about a tiara\u2019, and I went, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s The Crown!'\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview below.\n\nShe has also warned people however that her role as Queen Elizabeth will be very different compared to her Oscar-winning performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare the two. They both have the word \u2018queen\u2019 in the title but that\u2019s it, that\u2019s where it ends,\u201d she said in a post-Oscars interview with ABC.\n\n\u201cQueen Elizabeth\u2019s much harder to play. There are sort of no rules for Queen Anne: no one can say, \u2018She doesn\u2019t sound like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrince Philip: In late March 2018, it was announced that Outlander star Tobias Menzies would be filling the role of Prince Philip, after much speculation (it was initially rumoured that Paul Bettany was in line to replace Matt Smith).\n\nExplaining how he prepared to play the Duke of Edinburgh, Menzies told RadioTimes.com, \u201cI just listened to him loads. It\u2019s partly a technical thing: you want to sound and look like him, but move like him too. I\u2019ve gone slightly crazy just listening to him and listening to him.\u201d\n\nPrincess Margaret Veteran actress Helena Bonham Carter has taken on the role of Princess Margaret in series three, after Netflix confirmed the long-rumoured casting.\n\nIn January 2018, Vanessa Kirby, the actress who played Margaret in the first two series, shared an Instagram picture with Bonham Carter along with the caption \u201chonoured\u201d. She tagged The Crown\u2019s official Instagram account, too.\n\nLine of Duty star Jason Watkins plays Prime Minister Harold Wilson.\n\nCall the Midwife actor Erin Doherty has taken the role of Princess Anne.\n\nPrince Charles The Durrells star Josh O\u2019Connor plays Prince Charles in a key period in the Prince of Wales\u2019s history. O\u2019Connor joked he had \u201cthe ears for the part\u201d.\n\nBut appearances aside, O\u2019Connor has stated that he\u2019s not looking to entirely mimic Prince Charles, stating his role in The Crown is distinct from the real-life heir to the throne.\n\n\u201cWhat [writer] Peter Morgan does is that he doesn\u2019t just present us with what we can see on YouTube. He goes behind the closed doors,\u201d he said at the BFI and Radio Times Television Festival.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ticking little things people can register and identify as Prince Charles but going beyond that and creating a full character that isn\u2019t just Prince Charles, and is something else.\u201d\n\nThe Queen Mother is played by Marion Bailey.\n\nIn October 2018, Netflix confirmed that Call the Midwife star Emerald Fennell would play the key role of Camilla Shand (now known as Camilla Parker-Bowles, or the Duchess of Cornwall) \u2013 Prince Charles\u2019 future wife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely over the moon and completely terrified to be joining so many hugely talented people on The Crown,\u201d Fennell said, adding cheekily, \u201cI absolutely love Camilla, and am very grateful that my teenage years have well prepared me for playing a chain-smoking serial snogger with a pudding bowl hair cut.\u201d\n\nWinston Churchill makes one final appearance in The Crown season three, as John Lithgow returns to play the former Prime Minister. He is the only original actor to escape re-casting.\n\nGame of Thrones star Charles Dance appears in The Crown too, playing Prince Charles\u2019 favourite great-uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten.\n\nThe X-Files and Sex Education star Gillian Anderson meanwhile will play Margaret Thatcher in season four.\n\nWill Princess Diana feature in The Crown season three?\n\nEmma Corrin will play Lady Diana Spencer (the future Princess of Wales) in The Crown.\n\nWhile Corrin has been cast in the Netflix series, she won\u2019t make her first on-screen appearance until season four. However, with filming beginning on the fourth season, her casting was confirmed in April 2019.\n\n\u201cI have been glued to the show and to think I\u2019m now joining this incredibly talented acting family is surreal,\u201d Corrin said.\n\n\u201cPrincess Diana was an icon and her effect on the world remains profound and inspiring. To explore her through Peter Morgan\u2019s writing is the most exceptional opportunity and I will strive to do her justice!\u201d she added.\n\nHer new co-star O\u2019Connor later praised the casting, telling RadioTimes.com, \u201cI\u2019ve met her and I think she is young but she\u2019s totally on point. She\u2019s an incredible talent.\u201d\n\nHow similar do the new cast of The Crown look to the actual royals?\n\nWhile Colman will be familiar to British drama fans, it\u2019s striking just how similar she appears to Queen Elizabeth II in her first official photo in costume.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one: looking back at photos from the time, we can see that the new cast could well be very suited to their roles. Check out the comparisons here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs there going to be a season four of The Crown?\n\nYes, season four of The Crown will follow in 2020 with the same main characters, with a further two seasons (and a further cast reset) due in the following couple of years. So plenty more to look forward to for fans of the show.", "images": ["https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/08/cropped-radiotimes-header-logo-ad1202c.png?quality=90&resize=265,55", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2020/03/hamnet-2916df2.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/03/tobiasmenzies-ae36eb7.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/10/TheCrown_302_00237_R2-652ec97.jpg?quality=45&resize=556,556", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2020/04/Spring_Brandsite_1200x800_RTv2-da3a75a.jpg?quality=45&resize=1200,800", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/08/TC3_304_RC-9c81150.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2020/03/001-SE-14-3-Cover-footer-47186e2.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/08/python-for-article-0f0e8fe.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/12/ipso-sq-7800070.png?quality=90&resize=150,150", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/08/the-crown-a993dd4.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/GettyImages-954350490-copy-e5671f2.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/11/The-Crown-S4-7adfc09.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/12/the-witcher-geralt-4acfd53.jpeg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2020/02/freud_cleared_janhromadko__ep5-53_DSC_0997-81e255e-scaled.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/10/TheCrown_302_00237_R2-652ec97.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/02/TheCrown_304_Unit_00289_R-bed4b13.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413"], "top_img": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/02/TheCrown_304_Unit_00289_R-bed4b13.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Gill"], "canonical_link": "https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-11-30/the-crown-season-3-netflix-release-date-cast/", "title": "When is The Crown season 3 on Netflix?
