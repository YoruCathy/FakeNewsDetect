I'm so proud of you! Each of you have brought me so much joy! Walk closely with God, and be faithful to His word.\n\n\"Teach my grandchildren as you have been taught,\" Caruso instructs. \"Live each day and celebrate life \u2014 it is God's greatest gift!\"\n\nAnticipating her passing, she attempted to console her children. \"You can feel my love even now \u2014 know I am with you always, your mommy\"\n\nDaly returned to Today Wednesday for the first time since Caruso's death, telling his colleagues he's \"doing okay.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m healing. Still in stock,\" Daly shared. \"Really rough loss. Nobody likes that phone to ring in the middle of the night to get that call.\"\n\nFeeling akin to those affected by Sunday's Las Vegas shooting, Daly said, \"My heart re-breaks for everybody in Las Vegas, who just lost so many people, and they also got that call that somebody that they loved was suddenly taken away from them. It\u2019s an incredible pain.\"\n\nDaly thanked his colleagues for their support and expressed his gratitude for being a part of NBC's morning show. \"You guys gave my mom the greatest gift ever by employing me on the Today show because she could watch me every single morning in her kitchen and I know that she did,\" he said. \"And there\u2019s no place she\u2019d rather have me be than right back here.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/460a40eda64cabeb782fe8ed8194c760dcd49232/c=0-288-3456-4896/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427073815056653-XXX-USAW-CARSONDALY29-67344628.JPG?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94865da5a747e951f288be7abc652758b08b93a7/c=0-415-3443-2360/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427073815056653-XXX-USAW-CARSONDALY29-67344628.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5579958557001_5579954647001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94865da5a747e951f288be7abc652758b08b93a7/c=0-415-3443-2360/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427073815056653-XXX-USAW-CARSONDALY29-67344628.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/10/04/carson-daly-discovers-touching-goodbye-letter-his-late-mom-pattie-daly-caruso/730849001/", "title": "Carson Daly discovers touching 'goodbye' letter from his late mom", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Carson Daly discovers touching 'goodbye' letter from his late mom", "description": "Carson Daly's mom, Pattie Daly Caruso, prepared to say goodbye nearly two decades before her fatal heart attack last month.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/10/04/carson-daly-discovers-touching-goodbye-letter-his-late-mom-pattie-daly-caruso/730849001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94865da5a747e951f288be7abc652758b08b93a7/c=0-415-3443-2360/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427073815056653-XXX-USAW-CARSONDALY29-67344628.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Carson Daly's mom, Pattie Daly Caruso, prepared to say goodbye nearly two decades before her fatal heart attack last month.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/94865da5a747e951f288be7abc652758b08b93a7/c=0-415-3443-2360/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427073815056653-XXX-USAW-CARSONDALY29-67344628.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Carson Daly discovers touching 'goodbye' letter from his late mom", "description": "Carson Daly's mom, Pattie Daly Caruso, prepared to say goodbye nearly two decades before her fatal heart attack last month."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507046400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
