Always.\"\n\nCulkin -- who is also the godfather to the King of Pop's two sons, Michael \"Prince\" Jackson Jr., 21, and Prince \"Blanket\" Jackson II, 16 -- admitted that he's \"very protective\" toward the Sound Flowers singer during a conversation with Marc Maron on his WTF podcast back in January.\n\n\"I'm going to warn you now, I am very protective of her so just look out,\" the actor said when Maron broached the subject. \"I am a very open book when it comes to things but like with her, she is beloved by me.\"\n\nWhen asked simply how Paris is doing, the Home Alone star answered, \"She\u2019s tall, and beautiful and smart. It\u2019s great.\"\n\nCheck out the video below to hear more from the interview.\n\nMacaulay Culkin Opens Up About His Bond With Paris Jackson This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
