The model kicked off Coachella weekend and #REVOLVEFestival with a poolside dinner in celebration of her collection Ale by Alessandra x Revolve. Fellow Victoria\u2019s Secret model Sara Sampaio, as well as A$AP Ferg and many influencers celebrated the collection by her side.\n\nImage zoom Katie Jones/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nGrammy-nominated singer and Coachella alum performer, Halsey, rode out to the desert bar crawl style with Three Olives Vodka. Along the way, Halsey and guests stopped at the Three Olives Thrift Shop with cocktails and shopping. The singer then surprised guests at The Saguaro in Palm Springs for the vodka brand\u2019s \u201cFind Otherness\u201d party.\n\nFriday, April 14\n\nDon\u2019t put it past REVOLVE to keep the parties going into the weekend.

The Pretty Little Liars actress made her way over to the VELOCITY BLACK x 1OAK/Up & Down Beach Club, where partygoers attending the bash snacked on Catch LA sushi and desserts, refueled with massages by Zeel and IV drips, and even had the opportunity to jet-ski in the mega-mansion\u2019s very own backyard lake.\n\nRELATED: Every Can\u2019t-Miss Celebrity Outfit at Coachella (From Crazy-Cool to Hotter Than the Desert)\n\nUpon arrival, Mitchell posed for photos with her stylists, Marie-Lou and Chloe Bartoli. Those who opted for the day club instead of the festival danced to music by will DJ Taco (of ODD Future), as they sipped on cocktails by Absolut Elyx mixed with Red Bull, D\u2019usse and Budweiser. The star-studded guest list included some of Hollywood\u2019s finest, like Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Tyga, Russell Simmons, Rita Ora, Sofia Richie, Chanel Iman and more. Amid Tyga\u2019s recent split from girlfriend Kylie Jenner, an onlooker tells PEOPLE the rapper \u201cappeared to be in great spirits, as he sipped on a drink and partied with a table full of his male friends.\u201d\n\nThe rapper left the party with his entourage through the back entrance around 5:45 p.m., right around the same time Paris Hilton showed up hand-in-hand with Chris Zylka.\n\nWhile some were keen on showing affection, others just enjoyed the sunny California weather poolside at a private cabana with some best friends.\n\n\u201cOrlando was really low-key at the party. He wasn\u2019t flirting with any girls and was just wandering around with a guy friend,\u201d says an onlooker about the newly single star, whose ex Katy Perry partied at the FUNBOY X Smashbox pool party just miles away. \u201cTobey hung out at a VIP table and later spent time with his BFF Leonardo DiCaprio.\u201d\n\nImage zoom FameFlynet\n\nAnother day, another fashion celebration.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star attended the Pretty Little Things x PAPER Magazine party with besties Jordyn Woods and Stassie Karanikolaou. Once they arrived they decided to forgo the first stop at the carpet, and instead headed straight to the fun, where they quickly got comfortable at their VIP table by the pool and snacked on hamburgers and french fries while mingling with friends. Continuing on with fashion parties at Coachella, Hailee Steinfeld performed at Republic Records x sbe\u2019s \u201cThe Hyde Away\u201d Presented by Hudson.
