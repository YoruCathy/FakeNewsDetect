The couple found themselves in the spotlight after host Jack Whitehall stopped by their table for a chat. Things got steamy after Jack asked Liam if there was a \u201csafe word\u201d for his Fifty Shades of Grey performance with Rita Ora, which was coming later in the show. Liam joined in the joke and pointing at Cheryl, said: \u201cShe knows.\u201d\n\nBut instead of playing coy, Cheryl shared their bedroom secret, and jokingly said their safe word is \u201cdon\u2019t stop\u201d - to the shock and amusement of the crowd.

alert from the start with her upright back and fiddly hand clasp on the table suggesting she might have already smelled comedy trouble brewing. \"Her smile looked fixed and signs of anxiety were suggested in the way she started picking gently at her own fingers. \"When she dropped one hand, the other hand picked away at itself in what is known as body language leakage. \"This is when a smile
