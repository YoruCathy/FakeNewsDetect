In an actual study from Macquarie University in Australia, epidemiologists (people who study the spread and distribution of disease) examined the series and found that being of noble birth, female and flexible about loyalty were the strongest characteristics for surviving to the end. Sounds like we have a Daenerys Targaryen on the throne, then (although, she doesn\u2019t see herself there, apparently). Noble? Check. Female? Check. Wavering loyalty to the masters of Astapor who she had killed? Check.\n\nOther possibilities: Cersei Lannister, who is also noble, female and of wavering loyalty when it serves her best (#TBT to the High Sparrow). Sansa Stark is also in the running if we\u2019re going off this study, since she was \u201cloyal\u201d to the Lannisters when she married Joffrey.\n\nThe (highly technical) research noted that Game of Thrones characters who were nobles died at a lower rate than commoners, and women died at a lower rate than men. Also, switching allegiances, like the character of Tyrion Lannister does by siding with Dany, was another good strategy for outlasting rivals.\n\nJust an excuse for the team to rewatch all seven seasons? Possibly. More fuel for our group chat debate? Definitely.\n\nRELATED: These \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Scripts Might Have Just Confirmed a *Major* Fan Theory About the Old Cersei Prophecy", "images": ["https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2018_12/tyrion-dany-jorah-hero.jpg?auto=format,compress&cs=strip", "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2019_02/pw_white_logo.png?auto=format,compress&cs=strip", "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2018_12/tyrion-dany-jorah-msn.jpg?auto=format,compress&cs=strip&fit=min&w=600&h=315", "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2019_02/fb_login.png?auto=format,compress&cs=strip", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15961801&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2018_12/peter_billingsley_elf_a_christmas_story_400.jpg", "https://d1glun6kjhlyhe.cloudfront.net/v_2013/images/subscribe-mailbox-icon.jpg", "https://d1glun6kjhlyhe.cloudfront.net/v_2013/images/pw-entertainment-logo2.svg", "https://www.purewow.com/v_2013/images/snapcode.svg", "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2017_11/theCoterie-logo.svg", "https://d1glun6kjhlyhe.cloudfront.net/v_2013/images/placeholder-small-transparent.png"], "top_img": "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2018_12/tyrion-dany-jorah-msn.jpg?auto=format,compress&cs=strip&fit=min&w=600&h=315", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roberta Fiorito"], "canonical_link": "https://www.purewow.com/news/game-of-thrones-who-should-win-according-to-science", "title": "Who Should Win the 'Game of Thrones,' According to Science", "meta_data": {"thumbnail": "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2018_12/tyrion-dany-jorah-msn.jpg?auto=format,compress&fit=min&w=176&h=127", "title": "Who Should Win the 'Game of Thrones,' According to Science - PureWow", "description": "Whether you want to see Jon and Dany win it all, or you're putting your money on Arya and her hitlist, Game of Thrones fans have a hard time agreeing who should ultimately get the Iron Throne.", "keywords": "tv, HBO, study, news, Game of Thrones", "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-10T15:37:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-10T15:59:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PureWow"}, "FacebookShareMessage": "Valar morghulis: All men must die.", "google-site-verification": "_IUzbA1brhr5VAZoM_6knrRArtmPwibJlBjtditOZeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "moat": {"article_type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 410092635715198, "admins": 6908585, "pages": "134570403224681,251502288549594,1733023133584949,547492415455789"}, "og": {"site_name": "PureWow", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.purewow.com/news/game-of-thrones-who-should-win-according-to-science", "title": "Here's Who *Should* Win \u2018Game of Thrones,' According to Science", "image": {"identifier": "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2018_12/tyrion-dany-jorah-msn.jpg?auto=format,compress&cs=strip&fit=min&w=600&h=315", "height": 315, "width": 600}, "description": ""}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PureWow", "title": "Here's Who *Should* Win \u2018Game of Thrones,' According to Science", "description": "", "url": "https://www.purewow.com/news/game-of-thrones-who-should-win-according-to-science", "image": {"src": "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2018_12/tyrion-dany-jorah-hero.jpg"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544427420.0, "source": "https://www.purewow.com", "summary": ""}
