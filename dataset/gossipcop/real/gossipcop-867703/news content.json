By coincidence, we both booked a vacation at the same time in Greece! #magicaltiming #bestvacations.\u201d\n\nA few days earlier, the actor posted a photo of himself reading costar Lauren Graham\u2018s recent book, Talking as Fast as I Can: From Gilmore Girls to Gilmore Girls (and Everything in Between).\n\n\u201cCatching up on my reading in Greece,\u201d Truesdale wrote in the caption. \u201cAt last a vacation! Proud of my friend Lauren for her funny and entertaining new book! #talentedactress #friendship #bestvacations.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy, 46, and Truesdale previously reunited in March and shared a meal together.\n\nFROM PEN: The Cast of Gilmore Girls Discuss the Infamous Four Final Words of the Series\n\nWhile the show\u2019s revival on Netflix last year brought fans great joy (and hope for more), the show\u2019s stars aren\u2019t so sure there will be a continuation. Graham, 50, told IndieWire in June that the experience of playing Lorelai again was \u201ckind of perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always said, while we were doing it, that I couldn\u2019t see more episodes in that form,\u201d she said. \u201cFive years from now do you have A Very Gilmore Christmas?Maybe, but there\u2019s no reason anymore except enjoyment. And, actually, I think there\u2019s far more risk to continue \u2014 you run the risk of disappointing people.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgilmore-girls-melissa-mccarthy-yanic-truesdale.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2099'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgilmore-girls-melissa-mccarthy-yanic-truesdale.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgilmore-girls-melissa-mccarthy-yanic-truesdale.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/gilmore-girls-reunion-melissa-mccarthy-yanic-truesdale/", "title": "It's a Gilmore Girls Reunion!
