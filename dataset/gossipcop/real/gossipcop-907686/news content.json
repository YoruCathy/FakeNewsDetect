They can\u2019t represent some of us.\"\n\nEva Longoria, Amber Tamblyn and Patricia Arquette were also among thousands of activists across the country marching this weekend.\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a2ba95d38047c2864d81dad7162515ffd068524/c=0-202-3000-1897/local/-/media/2017/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636488565519404786-XXX-JONES14-95967055.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a2ba95d38047c2864d81dad7162515ffd068524/c=0-202-3000-1897/local/-/media/2017/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636488565519404786-XXX-JONES14-95967055.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e543f45805a9b0e1b2059dbfe5ecda3b0631408e/c=0-145-2996-1838&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/01/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636520552533760646-USP-News--Women-s-March.4.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a2ba95d38047c2864d81dad7162515ffd068524/c=0-202-3000-1897/local/-/media/2017/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636488565519404786-XXX-JONES14-95967055.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/20/alyssa-milano-stars-speak-2018-womens-march/1051198001/", "title": "Alyssa Milano, Viola Davis and more stars speak at the 2018 Women's March", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Alyssa Milano, Viola Davis and more stars speak at the 2018 Women's March", "description": "Here's what the stars are saying at the Women's March L.A. on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/20/alyssa-milano-stars-speak-2018-womens-march/1051198001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a2ba95d38047c2864d81dad7162515ffd068524/c=0-202-3000-1897/local/-/media/2017/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636488565519404786-XXX-JONES14-95967055.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3000, "height": 1695}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sara M Moniuszko", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Here's what the stars are saying at the Women's March L.A. on Saturday.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a2ba95d38047c2864d81dad7162515ffd068524/c=0-202-3000-1897/local/-/media/2017/12/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636488565519404786-XXX-JONES14-95967055.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Alyssa Milano, Viola Davis and more stars speak at the 2018 Women's March", "description": "Here's what the stars are saying at the Women's March L.A. on Saturday."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516377600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
