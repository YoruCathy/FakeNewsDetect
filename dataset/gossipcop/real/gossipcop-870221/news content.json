Warner Bros. announced nine days later that filming would resume, as their investigation did \"not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member.\"\n\nIn an interview with E! News over the weekend, Season 4 contestant Vinny Ventiera weighed in on changes made to the revived run, including a limit on alcohol consumption, along with cast members needing to tell producers that they consent before engaging in sexual activity.\n\n\"The most significant change was we had a limit on what we could drink,\" he said. \"We were only allowed two drinks per hour, so every hour, we'd have a log, and we'd go up there and get two drinks.\"\n\n12 PHOTOS Bachelor In Paradise 2017 contestants See Gallery Bachelor In Paradise 2017 contestants LOS ANGELES, CA - APRIL 11: Model / Reality TV Personality Corinne Olympios attends the 'PrettyLittleThing' campaign launch on April 11, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.

As if it's not already awkward that you're on camera hanging out with somebody, now you have to go in front of the camera and look at it and go, 'I'm willing to go spend the night with this person.' It wasn't a buzzkill, but it was a little bit of a speed bump.\"\n\nVentiera, who dated Izzy Goodkind on \"Paradise\" Season 3 last summer, said that trimming the filming from the typical 18 days to 10 meant there was less time for filler.\n\n\"It was definitely rapid-fire,\" he said. \"Less hours of sleeping, up bright and early.
