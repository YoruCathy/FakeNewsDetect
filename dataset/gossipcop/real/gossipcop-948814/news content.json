{"url": "https://theundefeated.com/features/can-drake-stop-trying-to-control-womens-sexuality-more-life/", "text": "With the impending release of his fifth studio album \u2014 the first since the four-time platinum, Grammy-nominated 2016 Views \u2014 Drake has many questions surrounding him. Can he again move a million units in a week? Can he prove all the doubters wrong after two years of ghostwriting allegations? Can he top \u201cHotline Bling\u201d or \u201cOne Dance\u201d? Can More Life overtake Take Care as Drake\u2019s undoubted classic album?\n\nBut also, can he, like so many artists in 2016 \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9 (Lemonade), Solange (A Seat at the Table), Rihanna (Anti), Kanye West (The Life of Pablo), Young Thug (Jeffery) \u2014 take risks on his new album, exposing a deeper version of himself? Drake and his legion of fans \u2014 and his seemingly equal number of detractors \u2014 are waiting with bated breath for March 18 to see what the 6 God has been cooking up. But before we can call the new project \u201cclassic\u201d or \u201ctrash,\u201d before we spend the next few weeks debating the best and worst tracks, here\u2019s the most important question that Drake has to answer: Can he stop attempting to control women?\n\nOver the past eight years, Drake\u2019s built up a reputation as being the compassionate and less threatening (read: soft) rapper who appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, cuddles up with professional athletes, and gets tattoos of Aaliyah. He\u2019s played the role of Nice Guy by constantly smiling, and apparently wearing his heart on his sleeve. This appeals to the sensitivities of the women in his fan base. But, as is often the case with these so-called nice guys, Drake plays the charmer \u2014 he\u2019ll call you beautiful, open doors for you and send you smiley-face emojis \u2014 but the minute he has sex with you, or you move on to someone else, he turns into Michael Ealy in The Perfect Guy.\n\nDrake\u2019s corniness, outward kindness and lack of sexual aggression has been misinterpreted as an overarching respect for women. He\u2019s even been referred to as a feminist. But Drake is as much a feminist as Rachel Dolezal is a black woman. His entire catalog is steeped in respectability politics, accepting women so far as their body count goes.\n\nThose songs pale in comparison to \u201cShot For Me,\u201d \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d and \u201cPractice.\u201d They are Drake at his worst.\n\nWhile he\u2019s constantly praised Nicki Minaj over the years, Drake belittled the Grammy-nominated artist during his beef with her former boyfriend, Meek Mill \u2014 Is that a world tour or your girl\u2019s tour? \u2014 implying that it\u2019s emasculating for a man to receive second billing to his significant other.\n\nAs with stars of rock and country music, almost every successful rapper today, from Jay Z to Future to Chance the Rapper, has at some point performed lyrics that objectify or exploit women. J.Cole\u2019s music has taken on more social justice elements over the years (Drake has spoken out for black causes as well). But Cole, in a 2013 song, called women \u201cb\u2014\u2013s\u201d \u2014I got smart, I got rich, and I got b\u2014\u2013s still/And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell \u2014 and patriarchally dismisses female sexuality on 2014\u2019s \u201cNo Role Modelz\u201d:\n\nMy only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet, my only regret was too young for Nia Long/Now all I\u2019m left with is hoes from reality shows, hand her a script the b\u2014h probably couldn\u2019t read along\n\nEven so-called progressive rappers fall into this trap, namely the androgynous Young Thug and the genderfluid Young M.A.\n\nSometime between Drake\u2019s early rise and his third mixtape being converted into 2009\u2019s So Far Gone, the rapper known for singing about his romantic feelings and the pressure of newfound fame \u2014 with a flow that made every 16 bars sound like the hottest verse ever \u2014 became his own worst enemy. Drake, known for hits like 2009\u2019s \u201cBest I Ever Had\u201d and 2010\u2019s \u201cFind Your Love,\u201d became synonymous with quote-heavy memes on social media, and fake Twitter accounts such as @drakkardnoir pumped out fake deep quote after fake deep quote.\n\nBut the rapper\u2019s verses about loving and being proud of college-educated, independent women \u2014 Sound so smart like you graduated college/Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard \u2014 paved the way for hypermasculine diatribes against the sexual agency of seemingly any woman he\u2019s ever encountered. Through an examination of Drake\u2019s four studio albums, plus mixtapes, collaborative projects and guest features, it is clear that the man who made music for folks who couldn\u2019t get over their exes was himself struggling with the basic concept of \u201cmoving on.\u201d\n\nWhile So Far Gone doesn\u2019t count as a studio album \u2014 it was his final mixtape before signing with Universal Republic \u2014 it gave listeners a sneak peek into the troublesome lyrics Drake would release in subsequent years. On the soothing track \u201cHoustatlantavegas,\u201d he raps about \u201csaving\u201d an exotic dancer from a strip club:\n\nYou go get f\u2014\u2013 up and we just show up at your rescue/Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you.\n\nI give you my all and the next morning you\u2019ll forget who or why, or how, or when/Tonight is prolly \u2019bout to happen all over again.\n\nThank Me Later, Drake\u2019s 2010 debut studio album, features the rapper slut-shaming women for having previous sexual partners. From \u201cKaraoke\u201d (I hope that you don\u2019t get known for nothing crazy/Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories \u2019bout his lady) to \u201cMiss Me\u201d (Work somethin\u2019, twerk something, basis/She just tryna make it so she\u2019s right here getting naked. I don\u2019t judge her, I don\u2019t judge her/But I could never love her) to \u201cThank Me Now\u201d (Alohas to women with no ties to men/That I know well, that way there are no lies), Drake positions women with previous sexual experience as undesirable. On the Rihanna-assisted \u201cTake Care,\u201d he seems to open up to the idea of women having sexual agency, relenting I\u2019ve asked about you and they told me things/But my mind didn\u2019t change and I still feel the same.\n\nThank Me Later was also at times a celebration of independent women \u2013 appreciating women\u2019s \u201cbook smarts and street smarts\u201d on \u201cShut it Down\u201d and \u201cFancy\u201d \u2014 but set the foundation for 2011\u2019s Take Care, which was, at that point, the peak of Drake\u2019s overt misogyny and objectification of women. On Take Care, which won Drake a Grammy for best rap album \u2014 he continues his focus on sex workers with \u201cLord Knows\u201d:\n\nTo all these women that think like men with the same intentions\n\nTalking strippers and models that try to gain attention.\n\nEven a couple porn stars that I\u2019m ashamed to mention.\n\n\u201cUnder Ground Kings\u201d (Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance/Sometimes I need that stripper that\u2019s gon\u2019 tell me that she don\u2019t dance) even creates a binary of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. While Drake has an infatuation with exotic dancers, he also makes it clear that admiration only goes as far as sex. \u201cTrust Issues,\u201d which Drake said he made for \u201cfun\u201d and thus didn\u2019t include on the album, has Drake playing into the thoroughly debunked myth that women can\u2019t want sex as much as men, rapping And it\u2019s probably why I\u2019m scared to put the time in/Women want to f\u2014 like they\u2019re me and I\u2019m them.\n\nThose songs, though, pale in comparison to \u201cShot For Me,\u201d \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d and \u201cPractice.\u201d They are Drake at his worst, going beyond the behaviors of the paternalistic and disapproving ex. He goes from telling a woman she\u2019s drinking away the pain she feels due to leaving him on \u201cShot For Me\u201d \u2014 Yeah, I\u2019m the reason why you always getting faded \u2014 to cursing out another for finding happiness with a new lover on \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (F\u2014 that n\u2014-a that you love so bad).\n\nDespite admitting that he\u2019s a flawed individual in the latter song, in the former he tells the woman that he \u201cmade\u201d her and calls her a \u201cb\u2014-.\u201d This then leads to Drake\u2019s most confusing and disturbing song to date, \u201cPractice.\u201d While acknowledging that women can have sex \u2014 the song is about a woman having multiple partners \u2014 Drake then spins it to his advantage: All those other men were practice, they were practice/Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me. He senses \u201cpain and regret\u201d in the woman from her past, and then reluctantly accepts the fact that she has casual sex. He tops the song off with an uncomfortable, familial request: You can even call me daddy, give you someone to look up to.\n\nBut, Drake can still change. His lyrics paint the picture of a man who is constantly questioning himself.\n\nIt\u2019s 2016\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling\u201d that ignited the re-examination of Drake\u2019s entire catalog. The song is the rapper\u2019s second-best-selling single of all time (behind fellow Views track \u201cOne Dance\u201d), and won him two Grammys at last month\u2019s award show. Not to mention, the visuals for the song will go down in music history as one of the most memorable music videos of all time.\n\nBut while the chorus is equal parts infectious and mesmerizing, Drake sneaks in two verses and a bridge full of \u201creductive stereotypes\u201d and body-policing lyrics about an old fling. Whether about said woman \u201cwearing less and goin\u2019 out more\u201d or \u201cgoing places where you don\u2019t belong,\u201d Drake makes it apparent that he\u2019s offended that she has the audacity to move on with her life. By the end of the song, Drake\u2019s become so desperate that he\u2019s even concerned that the woman is \u201cbendin\u2019 over backwards for someone else.\u201d Textbook narcissism.\n\nHis guest appearances have been a mixed bag as well. On rapper The Game\u2019s 2011 track \u201cGood Girls Go Bad,\u201d Drake raps Who\u2019s still getting tested?/Where\u2019s all the women that still remember who they slept with? and a year later added to 2 Chainz\u2019s \u201cNo Lie\u201d:\n\nShe could have a Grammy, I still treat her a\u2013 like a nominee\n\nJust need to know what that p\u2014- like\n\nSo one time is fine with me.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Drake has put out two mixtapes, a solo effort If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late, and What A Time To Be Alive with Future. His male chauvinism can be found on tracks \u201cLegend,\u201d \u201cEnergy\u201d and \u201cMadonna\u201d and repeatedly calls a woman \u201cungrateful\u201d for living her life without him on \u201cDiamonds Dancing.\u201d As writer Tahirah Hairston pointed out, Drake has also had questionable lyrics on \u201cWu-Tang Forever,\u201d \u201cOwn It,\u201d \u201cFurthest Thing,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m The Plug\u201d and even notable feminist Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cMine.\u201d\n\nBack in October, Drake released three tracks from his upcoming More Life album \u2014 \u201cFake Love,\u201d \u201cSneakin\u2019,\u201d and \u201cTwo Birds, One Stone.\u201d Looking solely at those tracks, it appears Drake has let up a little on his control, instead rapping about success, fake friends and his long list of haters. Even his appearance on labelmate Nicki Minaj\u2019s diss to Remy Ma, \u201cNo Frauds,\u201d he steers clear of trying to preserve women\u2019s sanctity.\n\nFor nearly a decade now, Drake has wrapped up his alarming lyrics inside catchy, Instagram-caption-worthy choruses and tunes. The \u201clight-skinned Keith Sweat\u201d gets away with this because he carefully crafted a \u201cnice guy\u201d persona that deflects the criticism that, say, a 21 Savage, Kodak Black or the Migos would receive.\n\nFor many men, Drake\u2019s attitudes reflect their own attitudes and desires, which in turn reflect a patriarchal society that views women as sexual objects meant to be gazed at. For women, they\u2019ve had to deal with sexism in the arts since the beginning of time, so choosing to not enjoy an artist because of his views on sexuality would mean giving up on music all together. And at the end of the day, Drake is just that good at his job, unquestionably the most influential and popular musician in the business right now.\n\nBut Drake can still change. His lyrics paint the picture of a man who is constantly questioning himself, consistently trying to become a better person, whatever that entails. From So Far Gone to More Life \u2014 age 22 to 30 \u2014 he\u2019s learned all the lessons life can teach, from whom to trust to what forms of happiness money and fame can buy. But it seems he\u2019s yet to learn that women aren\u2019t sexual objects. They\u2019re human beings. If the only women of the world were all exactly like the women he seems to respect \u2014 his mother or Rihanna or Aaliyah or Serena Williams \u2014 we\u2019d call him Aubrey the Riveter. But, they aren\u2019t the only women who deserve his respect.\n\nHe knows that. But it begs the question: Does he care?", "images": ["https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/johnson.png?w=90", "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-652599480.jpg?w=700", "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/r689927_2_1296x729_16-9.jpg?w=600&quality=70", "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1193185303-e1587039054106.jpg?w=600&quality=70", "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BLACKAF_107_Unit_00417R-e1586993601934.jpg?w=600&quality=70"], "top_img": "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-652599480.jpg?w=700", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martenzie Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://theundefeated.com/features/can-drake-stop-trying-to-control-womens-sexuality-more-life/", "title": "Can Drake stop trying to control women\u2019s sexuality?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Can Drake stop trying to control women\u2019s sexuality?", "url": "https://theundefeated.com/features/can-drake-stop-trying-to-control-womens-sexuality-more-life/", "description": "With the impending release of his fifth studio album \u2014 the first since the four-time platinum, Grammy-nominated 2016 Views \u2014 Drake has many questions surroundin\u2026", "site_name": "The Undefeated", "image": {"identifier": "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-652599480.jpg?w=700", "width": 700, "height": 394}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-18T21:06:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-18T21:06:30+00:00", "author": "https://facebook.com/MartenzieJohnsonESPN", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theundefeatedsite"}, "fb": {"app_id": 834240743288407, "pages": 1583598865225460}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "TheUndefeated", "id": 3033098871}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "maxage": 300, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "martenzie", "id": 194204409}, "image": {"src": "https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-652599480.jpg?w=700"}, "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Martenzie Johnson", "label2": "Filed under", "data2": "Music, Commentary, Rap, Drake, More Life"}, "DC.date.issued": 61814, "description": "With the impending release of his fifth studio album \u2014 the first since the four-time platinum, Grammy-nominated 2016 Views \u2014 Drake has many questions surroundin\u2026"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489871190.0, "source": "https://theundefeated.com", "summary": ""}
