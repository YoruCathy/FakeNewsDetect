And on Monday's episode of \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert, the star recalled some of her more outrageous moments \u2014 including when she flashed David Letterman on his birthday.\n\nBarrymore, who told Colbert that she \"tends to overdo it for people [she] loves,\" detailed one of her wildest appearances in 1995.\n\n\"I did something in particular with Mr. [David] Letterman on his birthday,\" she said.\n\nThe star went on to explain that she jumped up on his desk and performed a sexy dance where she famously flashed her breasts and ended the stunt by giving Letterman a kiss on the cheek.\n\n\"I literally was like, 'What?' I sometimes think, 'That doesn't feel like me.' It's like a distant memory that doesn't seem like me \u2014 but it is me,\" the star admitted to Colbert. \"And that's kind of cool. I'm still down with that. I'm a mother of two. I don't know. I'm such a different person now that it doesn't feel like me, but I'm still into it.\"\n\nThe \"Santa Clarita Diet\" actress then joked that she has no regrets about her show-stopping moment on Letterman and said, \"You only have one life!\"\n\nShe also reflected on her long history of late-night appearances. She said she had several cringeworthy moments.\n\n\n\n\"I did Johnny Carson in 1982, and I tripped on the step and really, really ate it. I think they cut to a different angle on the camera, because I was, like, splayed,\" Barrymore reminisced. \"I was like, 'This is a lesson in humiliation. It's 'The Tonight Show' and you're seven and you've completely eaten it.\"\n\nShe went on to explain that she became a frequent \"Tonight Show\" visitor as she rose to stardom.\n\n\"I would go on the show when Jay Leno and Joan Rivers were on. I was on his show, like, eight times and then I started bringing him gag gifts. Like, he was on his eighth divorce, and I brought him a set of dishes with his name on it. And I was like, 'Now whatever woman your \u2014 whatever woman you divorce is not going to want these because they say, Johnny.' I was a real card or something. I don't know why\u2014or how\u2014I had that sense of humor. But I loved joking with him.\"\n\nBarrymore also had a close friendship with Letterman.\n\n\"From the moment I went on \u2014 especially with my little dance number, which was completely spontaneous and not calculated in any way \u2014 he let the audience know it was OK,\" she said in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Weekly. \"From that infamous show, we developed a really fun chemistry. Then I just looked forward to going back.\"", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/21/931/524/694940094001_5755285429001_5755280696001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mafia-Hit-Man.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20104012734692.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/21/694940094001_5755285429001_5755280696001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/270/152/RT-Hollywood-sign.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e4bdc6f3-8d06-4623-b934-f4a25899cb6c/dc192956-9929-4f64-abb4-d9b8827a6fac/1280x720/match/270/152/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/21/694940094001_5755285429001_5755280696001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Morgan Evans"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/drew-barrymore-recalls-flashing-david-letterman-im-such-a-different-person-now", "title": "Drew Barrymore recalls flashing David Letterman: 'I'm such a different person now'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Drew Barrymore is no stranger to late-night appearances.
