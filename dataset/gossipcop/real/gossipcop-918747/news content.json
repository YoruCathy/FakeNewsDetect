Problem is, we don\u2019t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2018\n\nOn the numbers, Trump was correct. According to data released by Nielsen, the Academy Awards broadcast on ABC Sunday night did hit an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers, down significantly--20%--from one year ago, when the awards ceremony reached 33 million viewers.\n\nBut then there's Trump's even bolder claim: that he's the only \"Star\" anymore \"(just kidding of course).\" Of course? Trump's not kidding. He has repeatedly made claims to being the most powerful ratings force since the dawn of television, most recently--though falsely--claiming that the 45.6 million viewers who watched his first State of the Union address in January was \"the highest number in history,\" which it most definitely was not.\n\nAnd while the president loves to tease CNN about its third-place ratings of late, Trump has ignored MSNBC's rise. For the first week of March, MSNBC finished first among the advertiser-coveted demographic of viewers 25-54 in each hour from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., with Rachel Maddow, who has focused extensively on the investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, finishing the week as the top-rated show in cable news.\n\nMaddow, however, is not likely to fit the bill when the president talks about big ratings and \"Stars.\"\n\nHollywood observers note that the nominees this year did not include many hit movies and that viewership has been down for most of TV's big draws, including the Super Bowl, the Golden Globes and the Grammys. The Oscars had their last big year in 2014 when 43.7 million people tuned in to watch host Ellen DeGeneres take a selfie with Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt, and other stars that was retweeted more than 3 million times and is one of the most-retweeted messages ever.\n\nTrump, by the way, does not appear on the list of 30 most-retweeted tweets on Twitter, but Barack Obama does, with four of the top 30, and Hillary Clinton has two--including her \"delete your account\" retweet of one of Trump's own campaign tweets from 2016, making fun of Obama for endorsing Clinton.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/144x144/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmarkjoyella%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F01%2FMark-Joyella_avatar_1516125245-400x400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F927681466%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F927681466%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mark Joyella"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732/https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2018/03/06/trump-jokes-about-low-oscar-ratings-we-dont-have-stars-anymore-except-your-president/", "title": "Trump Jokes About Low Oscar Ratings: 'We Don't Have Stars Anymore, Except Your President'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Trump Jokes About Low Oscar Ratings: 'We Don't Have Stars Anymore, Except Your President'", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F927681466%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2018-03-06T13:58:32-05:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732/https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2018/03/06/trump-jokes-about-low-oscar-ratings-we-dont-have-stars-anymore-except-your-president/", "description": "Trump was the subject of several jokes during the Oscars ceremony, and the president seemed delighted to suggest he was far more popular than the actors in this year's nominated films.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trump Jokes About Low Oscar Ratings: 'We Don't Have Stars Anymore, Except Your President'", "description": "Trump was the subject of several jokes during the Oscars ceremony, and the president seemed delighted to suggest he was far more popular than the actors in this year's nominated films.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180306214732im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F927681466%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "creator": "@markjoyella"}, "description": "Trump was the subject of several jokes during the Oscars ceremony, and the president seemed delighted to suggest he was far more popular than the actors in this year's nominated films.", "author": "Mark Joyella", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Mark Joyella", "section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/business/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/4825-723", "published": "2018-03-06", "modified": "2018-03-06"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520265600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
