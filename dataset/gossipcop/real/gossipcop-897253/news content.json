This year, the NYFCC has given a key push to several fringe contenders hovering around the edges of the Oscar race, placing a spotlight on Girls Trip supporting actress Tiffany Haddish, whose standout role in perhaps the year\u2019s most beloved comedy (and one of the genre\u2019s biggest box office hits of 2017) could translate to a Melissa McCarthy-style nod from the Academy if she maintains momentum with larger awards bodies in the weeks ahead. On the men\u2019s side, The Florida Project\u2018s Willem Dafoe picks up more steam following his Gotham Awards nomination with a NYFCC victory in the best supporting actor category.\n\nLead actors Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan triumphed in their respective categories as well, continuing what appears to be an early consensus forming around Call Me By Your Name (the Gotham Awards\u2019 best picture winner) and Lady Bird (the National Board of Review\u2019s best director winner). Though Lady Bird was the big winner of the day, The Florida Project picked up an additional win for director Sean Baker, who was also recognized with nominations and/or wins from the Film Independent Spirit Awards, the Gotham Awards, and the National Board of Review.\n\nWhile Netflix still faces a bumpy road ahead as its streaming-focused release strategy presents a potential roadblock for its prestige titles like Mudbound and First They Killed My Father, the NYFCC has seemingly given the former film equal footing as its theatrical counterparts, highlighting Rachel Morrison\u2019s camerawork with a well deserved win among the cinematography set.\n\nAfter landing notices from the National Board of Review for its script and as one of the top 10 films of the year, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Phantom Thread additionally courted NYFCC attention, taking the group\u2019s screenplay prize in what\u2019s bound to be a fruitful showing on the precursor circuit for the renowned auteur\u2019s latest project, also touted as the final film starring retiring actor Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nWhile not a steadfast portent of Academy tastes to come (only three NYFCC best film winners have gone on to take best picture at the Oscars since 2007: No Country For Old Men, The Hurt Locker, and The Artist), the NYFCC\u2019s picks can add much-needed buzz to a given film or performance, reprioritizing respective contenders for non-critic guild voters deciding which movies to watch as they make their way through their collection of screeners.\n\nIn terms of crossover into Oscar nominations, each of the NYFCC\u2019s best film victors since 2007 \u2014 save for 2015\u2019s Carol \u2014 has received a corresponding Oscar nomination for best picture. Across the same frame, only two NYFCC best actress winners \u2014 Rachel Weisz (2012\u2019s The Deep Blue Sea) and Sally Hawkins (Happy-Go-Lucky) \u2014 didn\u2019t follow up with an Oscar nod. When it comes to the men, the only NYFCC best actor champions since 2007 who didn\u2019t receive an Oscar nomination occurred one after the other, when a three-year dry spell saw Robert Redford (All Is Lost), Timothy Spall (Mr. Turner), and Michael Keaton (Spotlight) emerging with NYFCC wins between 2013 and 2015.\n\nCheck out the full list of 2017 NYFCC Awards winners below, updating live as
