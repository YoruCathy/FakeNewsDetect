The mother of two was spotted heating up the dance floor with her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez while on vacation in the Dominican Republic on Sunday (Apr. 16).\n\n#afterparty #jlo #arod #altosdechavon #casadecampos #dominicanrepublic #onesir#nicksilva #the_concept A post shared by Miami Luxury Realtor (@susydunand) on Apr 16, 2017 at 4:47pm PDT\n\nThe former Yankees star\u2019s sister Suzy posted a video on Instagram of the couple having the time of their lives as they smiled and laughed together, while swaying to the music with fellow partygoers. The Shades of Blue star was in the Caribbean to perform a sold-out show with her ex-husband Marc Anthony at the Los Altos de Chavon theatre in La Romana on Saturday (Apr. 15).\n\nJennifer and Marc have maintained a close friendship since their split in 2011, and it looks like Alex has no problem watching the duo work together in such close quarters. The all-star athlete was spotted supporting the \u201cDance Again\u201d singer while she performed on stage with Marc during the dress rehearsal and final show.\n\nThe couple decided to turn their romantic getaway into a family affair by bringing their children along on the trip. Jennifer's twins Max and Emme and Alex's children Natasha and Ella joined their parents in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the latest stop on Jennifer and Alex\u2019s tour of romance. After news of their relationship broke in March, the couple jetted off to the Bahamas for some fun in the sun before returning to the US where they were spotted on dates in New York and Los Angeles. Most recently, the lovebirds enjoyed a day out in the Big Apple with Jennifer\u2019s mother Guadalupe.\n\nJennifer isn\u2019t letting her busy schedule stand in the way of love. It appears the 47-year-old is determined to spend any free time she has with Alex, in between working on her hit series Shades of Blue and preparing for the debut of her new dance competition series World of Dance. The latter will see the former Fly Girl, along with Derek Hough and Ne-Yo, search for the world\u2019s next top dance act.", "images": ["https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2017/04/17/000/457/063/featured_5_3.jpg", "https://www.himgs.com/css/hello/img/logo.png", "https://ca.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/02017041735008/\nhttps:/www.facebook.com/tr?id=1728383620790976&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=HS7uq1SZw320l9", "https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hello-canada/common/sjc-black.png"], "top_img": "https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2017/04/17/000/457/063/featured_5_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hello"], "canonical_link": "https://ca.hellomagazine.comjennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-dancing-domincan-republic", "title": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez heat up the dance floor in the Dominican Republic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez heat up the dance floor in the Dominican Republic | HELLO!
