But it\u2019s her mother, Katie Ryan, who\u2019s the most thankful for her daughter\u2019s comedy, as it helped her through the loss of her younger sister, Sarah. When she was grieving, it was her daughter who pulled her through.\n\n\u201cEven in those times, she was able to make me laugh,\u201d Katie told TODAY. \u201cMy parents, too\u2014they were in such despair and grief. I think Ava gave them a reason to kind of keep going. She became our sunshine\u2014I know it\u2019s kind of clich\u00e9\u2014in the darkest time of our lives.\u201d\n\nKatie\u2019s sister, Sarah, had cerebral palsy, as well as Prader-Willi syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and constant hunger.\n\nDespite the obstacles of Sarah\u2019s disabilities, the sisters, who were only three years apart, were very close.\n\nWhen Ava was born, Katie says Sarah was \u201cso excited.\u201d\n\nThey only had a short time together before Sarah passed away in 2011, but she and Ava shared a beautiful bond.\n\n\u201cShe would sit with Sarah, they\u2019d play with stickers,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWe tried to get them together at least an hour a day, anything to help Sarah get better, to fight through it. Sarah was so adorable. She had such a kind face. Ava really took to that and genuinely loved her.\u201d\n\nKatie credits Ava for giving her \u201ca reason to get up\u201d in the morning, when all she wanted to do after Sarah\u2019s death was wallow.\n\n\u201cIt was such a weird time in my life because I was going through the most grief I\u2019d ever experienced, but I also had this little girl with me who I just adored,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think just having a reason to get up, and not kind of wallow in my sadness\u2026I was able to put it aside.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Ava\u2019s personality really began to develop. Katie would record some of the funny things her daughter would do and say, and look back on them when she was having a rough time.\n\n\u201cShe started to develop this really silly personality and I was taking videos,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think her humor was going to translate to so many people. I just thought she was funny to me, because she\u2019s my daughter.\u201d\n\nToday, Ava\u2019s healing humor has made her an Internet sensation. Katie says her 7-year-old carries a notebook around with her and jots down ideas for new characters whenever they strike. She insists that Ava comes up with most of the videos and personalities on her own.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s naturally funny,\u201d Katie said. \u201cHer take on the world is innocent, but also a little mature, and I think people relate to that in some strange way. She\u2019s so smart for her age when it comes to picking up social cues.\u201d\n\nAva\u2019s aunt Sarah isn\u2019t here to watch the videos, but Katie is confident that she would have found her niece \u201chysterical.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loved to laugh. She had the best laugh in the world. She would have gotten such a kick out of her.\u201d\n\nOne thing is certain, Ava\u2019s videos are sure to make anyone\u2019s day just a little brighter.", "images": ["https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/categories/inspiration.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fedexemployee1.819.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-u4Lu0aSku9UgC.gif", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/Faithit_Blue.svg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/avaryanfinal.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/Faithit_White.svg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/categories/entertainment.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/marriage3.27.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/beans/images/avaryanfinal-8b38574.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BriannaLammHeadshot.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17463555&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/categories/parenting.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/categories/causes.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wifekids12.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/categories/spiritual.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/themes/faithit-v3/assets/images/categories/relationships.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jcross887.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seeyouhubs.jpg", "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hg899.jpg"], "top_img": "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/avaryanfinal.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bri Lamm", "Posted By"], "canonical_link": "https://faithit.com/katie-ava-ryan-daughter-humor-healed-death-sister/", "title": "Mom of 7-Yr-Old \u2018Viral Sensation\u2019 Reveals the Heartbreaking Tragedy That Her Daughter\u2019s Humor Healed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mom of 7-Yr-Old \u2018Viral Sensation\u2019 Reveals the Heartbreaking Tragedy That Her Daughter\u2019s Humor Healed", "description": "\"She became our sunshine\u2014I know it's kind of clich\u00e9\u2014in the darkest time of our lives.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/avaryanfinal.jpg", "width": 707, "height": 398}, "url": "https://faithit.com/katie-ava-ryan-daughter-humor-healed-death-sister/", "site_name": "Faithit", "updated_time": "2017-08-18T20:41:14-06:00"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/BriLamm/", "publisher": "https://facebook.com/sharefaithit", "published_time": "2017-08-18T15:43:55-06:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-18T20:41:14-06:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 546486202067457}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mom of 7-Yr-Old \u2018Viral Sensation\u2019 Reveals the Heartbreaking Tragedy That Her Daughter\u2019s Humor Healed", "description": "\"She became our sunshine\u2014I know it's kind of clich\u00e9\u2014in the darkest time of our lives.\"", "image": "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/avaryanfinal.jpg", "site": "@sharefaithit"}, "description": "\"She became our sunshine\u2014I know it's kind of clich\u00e9\u2014in the darkest time of our lives.\"", "google-site-verification": "p1PusuaqYBNuvlo_82vmTjDZM_vO0BM5MzPy2t5WTIM", "lytics": {"topics": "omg-entertainment-fi,omg-entertainment-fi,omg-humor-fi,omg-humor-fi,omg-inspirational-fi,omg-inspirational-fi,omg-bri-lamm-fi"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://faithit-eszuskq0bptlfh8awbb.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/favicon.png"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dmpmpfe5M4Q?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1503092635.0, "source": "https://faithit.com", "summary": ""}
