The video, which Paul initially called \u201ca moment in YouTube history,\u201d quickly drew sharp criticism for its offensive, voyeuristic treatment of a dead body hanging in a tree, and was removed by Paul on Jan. 1. After apologizing for the video, Paul announced he would temporarily suspend his channel to \u201ctake time to reflect.\u201d\n\nYouTube issued this statement on Jan. 10: \u201cIn light of recent events, we have decided to remove Logan Paul\u2019s channels from Google Preferred. Additionally, we will not feature Logan in season 4 of \u2018Foursome\u2019 and his new Originals are on hold.\u201d (Google Preferred is a premium advertising program that aggregates \u201cthe top 5 percent of YouTube content\u201d targeting users between 18 and 34.)\n\nAn earlier statement from YouTube on Jan. 2 condemned Paul\u2019s video, expressed sympathies with the family of the dead person seen in the video, and reiterated that the video violated YouTube\u2019s community standards regarding \u201cviolent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner.\u201d And on Jan. 9, YouTube tweeted the following from its official account:\n\nAn open letter to our community: Many of you have been frustrated with our lack of communication recently. You\u2019re right to be. You deserve to know what\u2019s going on. Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week. Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views. As Anna Akana put it perfectly: \u201cThat body was a person someone loved. You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness.\u201d We expect more of the creators who build their community on @YouTube, as we\u2019re sure you do too. The channel violated our community guidelines, we acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences. It\u2019s taken us a long time to respond, but we\u2019ve been listening to everything you\u2019ve been saying. We know that the actions of one creator can affect the entire community, so we\u2019ll have more to share soon on steps we\u2019re taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.\n\nThis, however, is the first action YouTube has taken against Paul because of the video. Notably, Paul has not been suspended or removed from YouTube, or its ordinary monetization network. (The Preferred Network attracts premium advertisers and earns at a higher pay rate.) Paul was issued a strike for violating YouTube\u2019s community standards; three strikes or violations are typically required for a user to be ejected from the platform outright.\n\nA YouTube spokesperson also emphasized that the company\u2019s decision to cut these particular business ties was specific to this case, and did not indicate a change in YouTube\u2019s policies regarding controversial content. Those continue to be handled separately.\n\nFurthermore, this may not be YouTube\u2019s only response. Its efforts to \u201censure a video like this is never circulated again\u201d are not limited to Paul\u2019s removal from the Preferred network or his projects with YouTube Red. A YouTube spokesperson said that the platform was always seeking to improve its efforts at moderating and removing offensive and inappropriate videos.\n\nGoogle took similar steps against PewDiePie last year when it was revealed that the YouTube star had posted videos with anti-Semitic comments.\n\nJason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, was unimpressed. \u201cGoogle\u2019s response was meaningless,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in where they ultimately go on this. On one side, they have their normal safe-for-Google strategy to tune the dials on the algorithm. On the other side, they have 80,000 employees [and] $35 billion in profit to come up with real solutions \u2026 A commitment to resources, both human and engineering, to better flag and prevent vitality of garbage.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-paul-youtube-CONTENT-2018.jpg",
