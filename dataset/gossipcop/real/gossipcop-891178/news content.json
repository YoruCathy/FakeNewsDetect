It will consist of contemporary, everyday, fashionable, fun, and comfortable athletic clothing for today's active and sporty woman. Pieces that can take you from the gym to the streets to lunch with the girls. #joggers\n\nBravoTV.com: What went through your mind when Kenya said she was pregnant?\n\nUm, nothing. I\u2019ve learned to not believe everything I hear. If it is true, I\u2019m happy for her. Kids are definitely a blessing\u2026but can we get her to pee on a stick?\n\nShow Highlight Kenya Moore Announces Her Pregnancy\n\nBravoTV.com: Do you think you and Porsha can move forward?\n\nI don\u2019t hold grudges, so moving forward is always an option, but I need to know what I\u2019m moving forward from! Porsha conveniently forgot who supported her throughout the season when the entire cast didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with her! I guess the grass is greener being up NeNe\u2019s ass after she\u2019s been s--- on all season, but I digress.\n\nBravoTV.com: What about you and NeNe?\n\nNeNe is like Trump; she wants everyone to be loyal to her but has never been loyal to anyone, past or present! I'm a practical woman \u2014 I don't expect more than I give. To me, loyalty is something that is earned and not freely given. Her expectations of friendships/relationships/mutual considerations are unrealistic. If we\u2019re ever on the same page of understanding those simple ideas, then maybe we can become hospitable.\n\nThat being said, NeNe poked the bear all season but wasn\u2019t ready for the results. She continued to insert herself into my personal life with her opinions, but per usual, she then tried to play victim. She does that so well! Everyone she has ever moved forward with had to kiss her ass. No thanks \u2014 not interested!\n\nThank you guys for your continued love and support!\n\n#ShebySheree\n\n#joggers\n\nXo,\n\nShere\u00e9\n\nGo behind the scenes at the #RHOA reunion:\n\n", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-kenya-asa.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/395/131/200413_4149847_Porsha_Williams_Calls_Out_Kenya_Moore_for_Ly.jpg?itok=oyIhYjdJ", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/contributor-logo/public/field_person_cover_photo/2018/04/rhoa-800x800_shereewhitfield.jpg?itok=gi3S_TS9", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/463/75/200410_4148728_Eva_Marcille_s_Beauty_Must_Haves_Include_Eye.jpg?itok=1CNyB7-J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/12/kandi-blog-image_2.jpg?itok=IpB5s9-L", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149831_Kenya_Moore_Calls_Nene_Leakes_a__Bully_with_.jpg?itok=zSFVD9lv", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/12/nene-blog-image_2.jpg?itok=j1ksa1YY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/12/shamari-blog-image_2.jpg?itok=pGcmiY4J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/651/151/180330_3693207_Sheree_Whitfield_Comes_for_Porsha_Williams.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/sheree-blog-image.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/12/bitch-stole-my-talent-promote.jpg?itok=fyDburwC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-kim-nene.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2018/03/dish-rhoa-cast-reunion-seating-chart.jpg?itok=9RIKykB9", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=mya4BAZX", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/12/eva-blog-image_1.jpg?itok=p0eek3cl", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/931/551/180406_3697016_Kenya_Moore_Announces_Her_Pregnancy.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=4JO_9G_y"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/sheree-blog-image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta/season-10/blogs/sheree-whitfield/sheree-nene-has-never-been-loyal-to", "title": "Shere\u00e9: NeNe Has Never Been Loyal to Anyone", "meta_data": {"title": "Shere\u00e9 Whitfield: NeNe Leakes Has Never Been Loyal to Anyone | The Real Housewives of Atlanta Blog", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "BravoTV.com: What's the latest on your She by Shere\u00e9 line?Shere\u00e9 Whitfield: She by Shere\u00e9 is expanding into a lifestyle line, and I'm so excited!
