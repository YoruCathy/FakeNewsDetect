I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama\u2019s movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she\u2019s a great filmmaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then we f**ked it all up,\u201d she says laughing. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we really knew how to execute it. And it\u2019s disappointing, but it happens. I\u2019ve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.\u201d\n\nCharlize finally got to play her perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, in Atomic Blonde, and she\u2019s convinced the new David Leitch movie will be a hit among fans and critics alike.\n\nThe actress admits her character, Lorraine Broughton, left her intrigued when she read the script because she had never seen a woman like that on the big screen.\n\n\u201cI might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),\u201d she smiles. \u201cYou know nothing about this woman. It\u2019s so rare that a female gets that in a movie.\u201d", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ef1y0A8erBLUc.gif", "https://www.media3.hw-static.com/media/2017/07/wenn_charlizetheron_071217_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3002265&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://www.media3.hw-static.com/media/2017/07/wenn_charlizetheron_071217_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janette Becerra"], "canonical_link": "http://www.hollywood.com/general/charlize-theron-still-upset-aeon-flux-didnt-work-60693723/", "title": "Charlize Theron still upset Aeon Flux didn\u2019t work", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#df8424", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 ,maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "author": "WENN", "article": {"topic": "Movies", "type": "Article", "category": "News", "publisher": "http://facebook.com/hollywoodcom", "tag": "atomic blonde", "section": "Movies", "published_time": "2017-07-12T10:44:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-12T11:46:56+00:00"}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Charlize Theron still upset Aeon Flux didn't work", "url": "http://www.hollywood.com/general/charlize-theron-still-upset-aeon-flux-didnt-work-60693723/", "site_name": "Hollywood.com", "updated_time": "2017-07-12T11:46:56+00:00", "image": "https://www.media3.hw-static.com/media/2017/07/wenn_charlizetheron_071217_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 825400}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Charlize Theron still upset Aeon Flux didn't work", "site": "@hollywood_com", "domain": "Hollywood.com", "image": {"src": "https://www.media4.hw-static.com/media/2017/07/wenn_charlizetheron_071217_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg"}, "creator": "@hollywood_com"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499856252.0, "source": "http://www.hollywood.com", "summary": ""}
