It answered some of the questions fans have been dying to know, and also gives a first look at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s third child, Chicago West.\n\nJenner\u2019s video, titled \u201cTo Our Daughter,\u201d shows the then-pregnant reality star holding little Chicago.\n\n\u201cShe looks completely different,\u201d Jenner says in the video. \u201cShe\u2019s so little.\u201d\n\nTyler Ross\n\nA post shared by Kim Kardashian Snapchats \ud83c\udf51 (@kimksnapchats) on Feb 4, 2018 at 3:03pm PST\n\nTyler Ross\n\nDuring the sweet moment, Jenner\u2019s best friend, Jordyn Woods, asks Kardashian if she\u2019s decided on a name.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna go with Chicago,\u201d Kardashian says. Jenner tells Kardashian she loves the name.\n\nTyler Ross\n\nJenner didn\u2019t reveal the name of her own baby girl, or a full photo or video. Her YouTube video shows only a shot of the baby\u2019s arm and leg wiggling around shortly after her birth.\n\nThere are many other big reveals in the video. Friends share how Jenner told them she was pregnant, and another friend says Jenner has wanted a child since she was 15.\n\nWoods confirms that in the video.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re 20 years old, you\u2019re just figuring out your life,\u201d Woods says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you want, you\u2019re an indecisive teenager and you\u2019re just becoming a young adult, and there was one thing that your mom knew for sure, and that was you.\u201d\n\nWatch the whole video below:", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785d552d00001f00943c38.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785e692d00004900943c3c.png?cache=j53ix4hhw0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785d0e1d000026006adce4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785e692d00004900943c3c.png?cache=j53ix4hhw0&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5df70b30240000840a5a35d7.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785e692d00004900943c3c.png?cache=j53ix4hhw0&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chicago-west-debut-kylie-jenner-baby-video_n_5a785620e4b0905433b6997c", "title": "Chicago West Makes Her Debut In Kylie Jenner's Baby Announcement", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "So many reveals in one video.", "keywords": "kim kardashian,kanye west,Kylie Jenner,celebrity pregnancy,chicago west", "og": {"title": "Chicago West Makes Her Debut In Kylie Jenner's Baby Announcement", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785e692d00004900943c3c.png?cache=j53ix4hhw0&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785e692d00004900943c3c.png?cache=j53ix4hhw0&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chicago-west-debut-kylie-jenner-baby-video_n_5a785620e4b0905433b6997c", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "So many reveals in one video."}, "article": {"tag": "kim kardashian,kanye west,Kylie Jenner,celebrity pregnancy,chicago west", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-05 09:42:42 -0500", "modified_time": "2018-02-05 18:27:34 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Chicago West Makes Her Debut In Kylie Jenner's Baby Announcement", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a785e692d00004900943c3c.png?cache=j53ix4hhw0&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "So many reveals in one video.", "creator": "ledbettercarly"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a785620e4b0905433b6997c", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517841762.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
