{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/15/olivier-rousteing-on-rihanna-kim-kardashian-and-the-balmain-army", "text": "A gorgeous July day in Paris, the haute couture shows are in full swing and the Four Seasons hotel is in glamour lockdown. A motorcade of buffed, black, presidential-scale cars lines the kerb outside its street entrance, currently occupied by two women in red-carpet hair and makeup who have paused at the exit for a prolonged session with a selfie stick. Inside, a chandelier the size of a meteorite twinkles above a vast expanse of black and white marble floor, the airy space punctuated by urns crowded with triffid-sized white gladioli, reed slender and supermodel height.\n\nIn other words, the scene is perfectly set for the entrance of Olivier Rousteing, Balmain\u2019s creative director and Paris fashion\u2019s most glamorous frontman. Except, of course, he isn\u2019t here yet, because I am 10 minutes early and he \u2013 like any self-respecting rock star \u2013 will be 20 minutes late. The restaurant is mostly empty, the diners having spilled out into the courtyard for post-lunch cigarettes and espresso, so I sip a Diet Coke served with elaborate ceremony by a waitress in a cocktail dress, and wait.\n\nAnd then here he is. He is in a black fedora, Keith Richards vibes, a sharp Balmain blazer with sleeves pushed up to the elbow. His chunky black and gold Rolex is exactly the watch Tutankhamun would have worn, were he to be reincarnated in 2016. Skinny jeans, biker boots, a black T-shirt faded to the perfect sultry charcoal. His sunglasses are enormous, the size of lab goggles. There is an awkward moment when he sits down opposite me and I think he isn\u2019t going to take them off, but then he does, flashing me the wide, slightly distancing smile of the very beautiful, the smile of a man accustomed to being admired.\n\nHe is ridiculously good-looking. Zoolander good-looking. Poreless skin, worked-out body, cheekbones for days. And while being good-looking has never been part of the job description for a traditional fashion designer, that is the point, because Rousteing is very much a non-traditional fashion designer. He is mixed race. He loves the Kardashians. He posts endless selfies. And he has reinvented the house founded by Pierre Balmain in 1945 as a new kind of fashion enterprise, one that \u201cis very pop, but communicates like a luxury brand\u201d. He is not always adored by the critics (of which more later). But can 3.8 million Instagram followers be wrong?\n\nThe industry is scathing about designers who pour their creative energies into their celebrity friendships and social media feeds, but Rousteing turns this on its head. He tells me the moment his creativity stepped up a notch was five years ago, when he moved from behind the scenes at Balmain to replace Christophe Decarnin as creative director. \u201cThat was a big step,\u201d he says. \u201cSchool can teach you to be a great \u2018designer\u2019\u201d \u2013 he puts ironic speech marks around the word with his fingers, as if to suggest being a designer isn\u2019t really a proper job \u2013 \u201cbut there is so much more to being a creative director.\u201d This job title, by contrast, he says in reverential tones. \u201cIt means overseeing everything from the business to the fittings to the campaign to the stores. It means having a vision.\u201d Where the traditionalists of Paris revere the role of designer and roll their eyes at that of creative director, Rousteing does the opposite.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Olivier Rousteing backstage at Paris fashion week with bosom buddies Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kris Jenner. Photograph: Michel Dufour/WireImage\n\nFrankly, Rousteing\u2019s Balmain frightens the life out of the fashion establishment, particularly in Paris, where a few blue-chip family names \u2013 Gainsbourg, Deneuve, de la Fressange, de la Falaise \u2013 have for decades ruled the front row like a quaint oligarchy. Rousteing, by contrast, has forged an alliance with the Kardashian-Wests, an American family who have built a multimillion global empire on sex tapes and nude selfies. To use an analogy with a suitable level of cultural bling, Olivier Rousteing is to the Kardashians what Sandro Botticelli was to the Medici family. Critics who dismiss Balmain\u2019s dresses as vulgar because they are made for Kim Kardashian might bear in mind that Botticelli painted Primavera for the Medicis.\n\nThe Balmain aesthetic is tight, bright and leggy. It is a rarefied, artisan-embroidered, exquisitely tailored version of an aesthetic instantly recognisable by any 18-year-old as Friday-night partywear. \u201cSome people feel luxury shouldn\u2019t look like what the masses like,\u201d Rousteing says. \u201cThey feel it should be more elitist. But Balmain talks to young people. It\u2019s not about selling to them, it\u2019s about making them part of my world. And the people who can afford to buy luxury fashion, today those women want to feel young. So Balmain is pop, but it is a luxury brand as well. I don\u2019t think you have to make sad, complicated clothes to show you have depth.\u201d The aesthetic is accessible, but the prices are stratospheric \u2013 so high that they make Balmain feel aspirational in an abstract way. Like diamonds, or skiing holidays.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Olivier Rousteing hanging out with Justin Bieber at the Met Ball in New York. Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nTogether, Rousteing, the Kardashians and a \u201cBalmain army\u201d of I\u2019m-with-the-brand model-groupies have staged a coup over the fashion establishment as gamechanging as it is glamorous, in which the traditional gatekeepers of taste are bypassed. Consider, for example, how Balmain\u2019s autumn/winter 2016 collection has made it into the public consciousness. When Kardashian-clan supermodel and Rousteing\u2019s close friend Kendall Jenner opened and closed the show in March, she shared the moment with her 63 million Instagram followers. (It pains me to say it, but with that kind of instant reach, it arguably doesn\u2019t matter whether newspaper critics like your show.) In July, Kanye West and Rousteing jointly released a music video for West\u2019s single Wolves which doubled as the Balmain autumn/winter 2016 campaign video, featuring Kim Kardashian and models including Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn and Alessandra Ambrosio wearing the collection. \u201cWith music, you talk to an entire generation, where sometimes with fashion, you don\u2019t talk to an entire generation because not everybody gets magazines,\u201d Rousteing told Vogue. Within two days, the video had been watched five million times on YouTube.\n\nYet when we meet, two weeks before the video will be released, Rousteing is in sensitive mood. In particular, and awkwardly, he is fed up with critics, who he feels disparage his work.\n\n\u201cThe reality of fashion is that the more success you have, the more haters you get. I am talking about journalists. But I understand that I will not always be loved in fashion, and that the only thing that matters is the business I am building. So, I don\u2019t care.\u201d I am not entirely convinced of the veracity of this sentence, especially when he continues, \u201cYou can dislike my show, but don\u2019t come to my show and then write 20 lines about how my face looks on Instagram! If that\u2019s what you want to write, don\u2019t bother coming to see six months\u2019 hard work. Just stay home!\u201d\n\nHaters? It is a word a pop star would use, not a fashion designer. But then that is Rousteing\u2019s world. Earlier that day, I visited the Balmain showroom to see the resort collection, some of which had been showcased during the menswear show the week before. One fringed and latticed leather coatdress in cornflower blue looked familiar: Rihanna had already worn it on a night out in London, a couple of days after the show, at which it had been well-documented by the paparazzi. I asked Rousteing how that came about.\n\n\u201cThe night of the show, she [Rihanna] texted me and she was like, \u2018Babe, I love that show, so beautiful, it was amazing.\u2019 So I texted back, \u2018What do you like?\u2019 and she sent me a picture of the blue coat and I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll send it tomorrow.\u2019 There is no strategy. It comes from a text, from love and friendship. I don\u2019t need PRs.\u201d At this point he remembers his PR is sitting next to him and says, \u201cI mean, of course I need PR. But I don\u2019t need them for that.\u201d His PR, sanguine, concurs. \u201cWhen you see someone wearing Balmain, there\u2019s no contract. It\u2019s a real relationship, and that\u2019s the magic.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rihanna wore a Balmain outfit to a fragrance launch in Paris just a few days after it was first shown on the catwalk. Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nRousteing has sufficient star quality not just to get his clothes in paparazzi photographs, but to be in the frame himself. There is a striking photograph of Beyonc\u00e9 from this year\u2019s Met Ball after party, in which she is lounging on a velvet sofa, gazing at Rousteing next to her, who is talking and gesticulating, feet pulled up on the sofa as if he owns the place. Rousteing wants to be the face of Balmain, because that is \u201ca positive message\u201d, he says. He spent the first year of his life in an orphanage before being adopted by a middle-class white couple, who brought him up in Bordeaux. \u201cDiverse is a word that is really important to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to show that no matter your background, no matter what colour you are, where you come from, you can feel part of Balmain.\u201d He is a committed activist for diversity in fashion, consistently casting a range of ethnicities for his catwalks and ad campaigns, and appearing on Newsnight and CNN to challenge the fashion industry\u2019s lack of diversity.\n\nRousteing began his career in Italy, where he spent five years at Roberto Cavalli before moving back to France. For two years, he worked closely with Decarnin, adored by the French Vogue in-crowd for his haute-grunge aesthetic of insanely expensive ripped jeans, before stepping up to replace him in 2011 at the age of just 24. Between 2013 and 2015 revenue grew by 50% \u2013 but this tells only half the story. Balmain\u2019s new celebrity firepower brought it a vast slice of the fashion bandwidth, and this new status as an industry headliner brought about the collaboration with H&M last year, which made the brand a household name. In June this year, Mayhoola, the Qatari private investment company that owns Valentino, announced the acquisition of Balmain, with a view to growing the brand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rousteing has recreated Balmain\u2019s aesthetic: under his leadership it is tight, leggy and bright. Photograph: Jason Lloyd-Evans/The Guardian\n\nRousteing was closely involved in sealing the deal. \u201cI met them right at the start, and we clicked. They understand the depth in my work. They get that I have success because I work hard.\u201d To paraphrase Melanie Griffiths in Working Girl, Rousteing has a head for business and a bod for Instagram. \u201cThe point of my Instagram is to show the beauty of my life. I want to inspire people. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to post a picture of me where I don\u2019t feel like I am pretty, and I am not going to post a picture of my collection before it is ready. But everything is real. I can post a picture of a flower, of my grandma at Christmas.\u201d The bio on his Instagram reads, \u201cTHIS IS MY REALITY\u201d. To be fair, it is probably quite hard to take a bad photo of someone who looks like Rousteing.\n\nHe works at this. \u201cI go to the gym every morning at 7.30. I work out, I box, and then I go to work for about 10am. I work late, so I eat in the office in the evening. And then I want to go to sleep, because I will be up early at the gym. I might go out Friday or Saturday, but not both.\u201d He was working late in his office on the Friday evening in November last year when news broke of the terrorist attacks that killed more than 130 people. Rousteing\u2019s apartment, like many of his colleagues\u2019, is in the 11th arrondissement, close to where the attacks took place, so they slept in the office. That weekend, he stayed in a hotel. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone in my life in Paris,\u201d he told Vogue. \u201cMy assistants and colleagues went to their boyfriend\u2019s or girlfriend\u2019s or parents\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t have that here.\u201d\n\nRousteing does have a support network, but it is a meta, international one. \u201cWhen I post on Instagram about Justin [Bieber] or Lewis [Hamilton] or Kim or Rihanna, that\u2019s a real friendship I am showing. If I love your album, I\u2019ll post about your music. But also, we can call each other at 5am when we just need to talk.\u201d\n\nHis connection to the Kardashians came through West, whom he first had lunch with seven years ago. These days, he is very close with Kris Jenner (\u201cI am always with Kris\u201d) and devoted to Kim. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody says about Kim. I love her. I love that she is a woman but has more power than so many men. And I love that she is so powerful but always takes care of the people she loves. And I admire her, because she is the best in the world at communicating with people.\u201d Like it or not, Kim makes people want what she has. It\u2019s a gift her friend Rousteing also has. Balmain\u2019s global presence is only going to grow as the house\u2019s new owners add their financial clout to the cultural pull of the Balmain army. \u201cFashion is a business. If you have a job in fashion, you have that job because people want fashion \u2013 and they want my fashion. You can dislike my taste, but you can\u2019t say I\u2019m not relevant.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/05/20/Jess_Cartner-Morley,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=83e14d6ea08e266b435fb3b9114f1828", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3fe1c030ebd1e618944b35b4e401ae2b0e6c78/0_0_2550_3000/master/2550.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89deafd4c75ba28c4bcdded826d99b95", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326de5a1b7759ce807d812bc8c1bd2810945e8dc/613_947_8075_4845/8075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fab207885fef2f5801e38b340034c8a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4ccb93a94e5753cbf81c70afe27a337637fb58/0_0_3000_2001/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3aa57aecbf823ee5c4041a4b003e9b94", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326de5a1b7759ce807d812bc8c1bd2810945e8dc/613_947_8075_4845/master/8075.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=923ee371a223813fd856c19da7ceff82", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ec0c4dad176647d029ad22c698c9f09f3de888/0_855_3280_3908/master/3280.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89c8dc383f6ff71c6ecd326ba0841294", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fec7a7a49e77a5a2e7894ade6533b3809b23b6d/0_0_3016_4642/master/3016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=305079e231cf23dce4527c6c935904c7", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Fashion%2CCelebrity%2CLife+and+style%2CWomen%27s+dresses%2CKendall+Jenner"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326de5a1b7759ce807d812bc8c1bd2810945e8dc/613_947_8075_4845/8075.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fab207885fef2f5801e38b340034c8a", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jess Cartner-Morley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/15/olivier-rousteing-on-rihanna-kim-kardashian-and-the-balmain-army", "title": "Olivier Rousteing on Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and the Balmain army", "meta_data": {"description": "With his model good looks, celebrity friends and Instagram fame, Olivier Rousteing is not your traditional fashion designer.
