She appeared on television shows like Deal or No Deal and films like Remember Me, but her most notable role was as Rachel Zane on American TV show Suits, which she appeared on from 2011 to 2017. But on her wedding day, her worlds collided when a surprise guest showed up.\n\nAfter the nuptials at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, the happy couple embarked on a carriage ride through London. However, they had no idea that ITV News, an English news station, had a special guest waiting for them.\n\nThe moment Meghan saw our studio guest Gigi Perrreau - her drama teacher from #Immaculateheart School in LA. The person you could say helped make today happen!! \u201cOh my God\u201d Meghan said from her carriage ... @ITV #royalwedding https://t.co/aBCNvhWoug \u2014 Chris Ship (@chrisshipitv) May 19, 2018\n\nGigi Perreau, Markle's former drama teacher and 1940s film star, was a guest of ITV as an exclusive contributor. As the carriage grew closer, Perreau wondered aloud if the new duchess would recognize her. She was right.\n\n\u201cOh my God\u201d screams Meghan as her old drama teacher Gigi Perreau manages to catch her eye in the crowd! Two seconds before I said do you think she\u2019d recognise you! She was right! @itv @itvnews pic.twitter.com/6QMqLV1lp3 \u2014 Alex Beresford (@alexberesfordTV) May 19, 2018\n\nIn the video, Markle sees her old teacher and exclaims \"Oh my God,\" as she makes direct eye contact before the carriage pulls away. It causes Harry to look at her as well. Perreau is obviously delighted, and the acknowledgment makes for a sweet moment in the midst of what's a long and exciting day for the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghanmarklecarriage-960100230-1526746218.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.656xh;0,0.101xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghanmarklecarriage-960100230-1526746218.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.656xh;0,0.101xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Temi Adebowale", "Temi Adebowale Is The Editorial Assistant At Men'S Health."], "canonical_link": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a20758259/meghan-markle-drama-teacher-gigi-perreau-carriage-ride-royal-wedding/", "title": "Meghan Markle Spotted Her Old Drama Teacher During the Royal Carriage Ride", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#BE3E19", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Town & Country", "title": "Meghan Markle Spotted Her Old Drama Teacher During the Royal Carriage Ride", "description": "This was the sweetest moment.", "url": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a20758259/meghan-markle-drama-teacher-gigi-perreau-carriage-ride-royal-wedding/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghanmarklecarriage-960100230-1526746218.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.656xh;0,0.101xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 526594570689062, "pages": 344794953432}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TownandCountryMagazine", "modified_time": "2018-05-19 04:23:34", "published_time": "2018-05-19 04:23:00", "section": "Heritage", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TandCmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghanmarklecarriage-960100230-1526746218.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.656xh;0,0.101xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "musQPiBADe3f4WpT4JNcg9uUChC3qnOhhPLSR4n1urM", "title": "Meghan Markle Spotted Her Old Drama Teacher Gigi Perreau During the Carriage Procession After the Royal Wedding", "description": "Before Meghan Markle married Prince Harry\u200b and became the Duchess of Sussex\u200b, she was a working actress in Hollywood.
