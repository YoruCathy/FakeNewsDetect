{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/simone-biles-honorary-texans-cheerleader", "text": "Simone Biles can now officially add \"honorary Houston Texans cheerleader\" to her resum\u00e9, right below \"Olympic gold medalist.\" Casual.\n\nThe Team USA gymnast was gifted a pair of the squad's legendary red boots on Friday, making her the first-ever \"honorary\" member. She then showed them \u2014 and her cheer-tastic moves \u2014 off on the field during Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers, E! reported.\n\n\"Game day feels,\" Simone wrote on social media ahead of her big debut. \"So excited to dance at the Houston Texans Game!\"\n\nThe Houston native posed for photos alongside the rest of the red-boot-wearing team and also posted one of her \"short/tall\" pictures with retired basketball pro Hakeem Olajuwon, who stands more then two feet taller than Simone (she's 4'9,\" he's 7'0\").\n\nThis is hardly the first time Simone has solidified her chops as a dancer and a gymnast \u2014 or in this case, both at once. The 20-year-old famously appeared on this year's cycle of Dancing With the Stars and was eliminated in a way that left many fans outraged. After receiving two perfect scores from the judges, Simone was still sent home, which many considered to be a direct result of the response she dished to a host who told her to \"smile\" while receiving criticisms.\n\n\"Smiles don't win you gold medals,\" she replied at the time, which became the #clapback heard 'round the world and will forever be commemorated with #smilesdontwinyougoldmedals merch.\n\nEven so, Simone was all smiles for her afternoon on the field with the Texans. \"I had such an amazing experience cheering at the Texans Game \u2764\ufe0f Definitely a memory to last forever!\" she captioned a postgame shot on Instagram. While it doesn't appear that she'll be swapping #teamUSA for #teamTexan in any permanent capacity, here's hoping those red boots make some sort of appearance at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nRelated: Simone Biles Posted a HILARIOUS Video of Herself After Getting Her Wisdom Teeth Removed", "images": ["https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ea6385cb6fe7a3bd72a51/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/simone-biles-cheerleader.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ebd9bfac2677fc77a945b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/simone-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a15acadd3645b573a3dd49c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/1474466652164.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ebd9bfac2677fc77a945b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/simone-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zo\u00eb Weiner", "Zo\u00eb Weine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/simone-biles-honorary-texans-cheerleader", "title": "Simone Biles Makes Debut as Honorary Texans Cheerleader", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Zo\u00eb Weiner", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Olympic gymnast and four-time gold medal winner Simone Biles just made her debut as the first-ever honorary Houston Texans Cheerleader.", "id": "5a2ea558fac2677fc77a944c", "keywords": "lifestyle,simone biles,snd", "news_keywords": "lifestyle,simone biles,snd", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a2ea558fac2677fc77a944c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Olympic gymnast and four-time gold medal winner Simone Biles just made her debut as the first-ever honorary Houston Texans Cheerleader.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ea6385cb6fe7a3bd72a51/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/simone-biles-cheerleader.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ea6385cb6fe7a3bd72a51/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/simone-biles-cheerleader.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s not leaving gymnastics behind.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ebd9bfac2677fc77a945b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/simone-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Simone Biles Just Made Her Debut as an NFL Cheerleader", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/simone-biles-honorary-texans-cheerleader"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s not leaving gymnastics behind.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a2ebd9bfac2677fc77a945b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/simone-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Simone Biles Just Made Her Debut as an NFL Cheerleader"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
