Six Hispanic achievers under the age of 30 from throughout the country will be recognized on the PJ 2017 stage for their grass-roots advocacy on behalf of the environment, education and social inclusion.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the spirit of Premios Juventud this year and the focus on social action, we are pleased to add the surprise performance of Shakira with Coldplay, thanks to Global Citizen, an organization focused on eradicating poverty and making the world a better place through the actions of each and every citizen,\" said Univision\u2019s President of Music Jorge \u201cPepo\u201d Ferradas.\n\nWilver Valderrama was one of the celebrities that had the honor in celebrating the outstanding work of the youth with the \"Agentes de Cambio\" award.
