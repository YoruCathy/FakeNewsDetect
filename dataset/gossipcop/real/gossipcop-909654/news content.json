Two months later, the song\u2019s remix -- featuring Lil Wayne and Kehlani -- was released, along with his debut album, American Teen. In August, he won Best New Artist at the VMAs. By November, he was a GRAMMY nominee.\n\n\u201cThis year has most absolutely been one big whirlwind,\u201d the artist, born Khalid Donnel Robinson, recently told ET. \u201cI try to take all of my experiences in and not take anything for granted. It\u2019s really hard for me to pick and choose highlights because everything has been so incredible!\u201d\n\nIt may be tough for him to pick a standout moment from a year that looks more like a best-of reel, but one highlight has to be the singer calling his own shot when it comes to the GRAMMYs. On the morning that nominations were announced, fans were quick to point out a 2014 tweet where a then-15-year-old Khalid declared, \u201cI want to go to the Grammys one day.\u201d\n\nI want to go to the Grammys one day. \u2014 Khalid (@thegreatkhalid) January 27, 2014\n\nOn Jan. 28, 2018, nearly four years to the day after sending that tweet, the singer will attend the awards ceremony as a nominee in five categories: Best New Artist; Best Urban Contemporary Album, for American Teen; Best R&B Song, for \u201cLocation\u201d as well as Song of the Year and Best Music Video for his feature spot on Logic's \"1-800-273-8255.\"\n\n\"It definitely has not sunk in yet. I don\u2019t know if it ever will,\u201d Khalid said of the nominations. \"This journey so far has been truly amazing, and I'm so grateful to have this platform to share my art and who I am as an individual. To be recognized and accepted by my musical peers is truly an honor.\"\n\nJudging by his Rolodex, the young star has certainly earned the recognition of his peers, even before GRAMMY nods were announced. This year alone, he\u2019s worked with some of the music world\u2019s biggest stars, including Lorde, Calvin Harris, Marshmello and Charli XCX. So what was his favorite musical collab of 2017?\n\n\"I'd definitely say performing a mash-up of 'Thunder' and 'Young Dumb & Broke' with Imagine Dragons at the AMAs was the coolest collaborative moment so far,\u201d Khalid mused. \u201cI think the performance was unexpected, but it turned out great, and it was so much fun.\u201d\n\nAs for an artist he\u2019s dying to work with, the performer admitted, \u201cI\u2019d love to collaborate with Frank Ocean. He\u2019s one of my favorite artists of all time.\u201d\n\nIf anyone can make a collaboration with the elusive Ocean happen, it may be Khalid, who shows no signs of slowing down after kicking his career into high-gear this year. Following the GRAMMYs ceremony, he\u2019s headed to Europe for concert dates throughout the spring before returning stateside to kick off his North American tour, which is adorably named after his new rescue pup, Roxy. But even that's not all for him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep on writing and making new music,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in the studio every chance I get and hope I can collaborate with some more of my favorite artists.\u201d\n\nLife on the road comes pretty naturally to Khalid, who grew up moving around the United States and even spent six years in Germany due to his mother\u2019s career in the military. The singer has spoken in the past about how his mother, Sergeant First Class Linda Wolfe -- who sang in the Army band before retiring earlier this year after 23 years of service -- has been his biggest musical inspiration, and he can\u2019t wait to take her with him to the GRAMMY Awards in January.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am right now if it wasn\u2019t for my mom,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe moment is going to be unforgettable for the both of us, and I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else by my side.\u201d\n\nAt the ceremony, the singer and his mom will likely be sharing the red carpet with similarly-named super producer DJ Khaled, and it\u2019s not the first time the two will be crossing paths. But, while Khalid admits that getting mixed up with the \u201csuper cool\u201d music mogul can be frustrating at times, he\u2019s confident about making his own name in the business: \u201cEveryone will get the hang of it eventually!\u201d\n\nAnd even after the whirlwind success that came with 2017, when it comes to his music, he\u2019s taking things one step at a time.\n\n\u201cI try not to get too ahead of myself in terms of my career and take in each moment as it comes,\u201d Khalid reflected. \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep creating music, performing and connecting with my fans. I\u2019m really excited about what the future holds and to grow as an individual and as an artist.\u201d\n\nThe GRAMMY Awards air on CBS on Sunday, Jan. 28.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nREAD: GRAMMYs Snubs and Surprises: Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift & More!\n\nWATCH: The 10 Best GRAMMY Duets\n\nPICS: Meet All 75 Swoonworthy Guys in Charli XCX's 'Boys' Video -- From Joe Jonas to KAYTRANADA", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-12/1280_khalid_gettyimages-867678168.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=y3c1OPpw", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/eto_trending_vanessabryantribute_041320_vidpic.jpg?h=d1cb525d&itok=MkFXHUBX", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_khalid_gettyimages-867678168.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=KtgWJ0XP", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_khalid_gettyimages-867678168.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=KtgWJ0XP", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meredith B.
