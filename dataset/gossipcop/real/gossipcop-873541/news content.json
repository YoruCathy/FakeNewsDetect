They go to the playground and they have friends of all races and backgrounds, and they just play, and they laugh, and they have fun,\u201d he added.\n\nFallon said that \u201cas kids grow up, they need people to look up to \u2014 to show them what\u2019s right, and good. They need parents and teachers, and they need leaders who appeal to the best in us.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Hate crime in Canada: do our laws allow a white nationalist rally?\n\n\u201cThe fact that it took the president two days to come out and clearly denounce racists and white supremacists is shameful. And I think he finally spoke out because people everywhere stood up and said something. It\u2019s important for everyone \u2014 especially white people \u2014 in this country to speak out against this. Ignoring it is just as bad as supporting it.\u201d\n\nFallon\u2019s monologue noted Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman who lost her life when a car drove into a crowd of protesters on Saturday night, saying that she \u201cdied standing up for what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer wanted to deliver message to white supremacists\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t look at my beautiful, growing, curious daughters and say nothing when this kind of thing is happening,\u201d he said.\n\nIn closing his monologue, Fallon said \u201cwe all need to stand against what is wrong, acknowledge that racism exists, and stand up for all that is right, and civil, and kind. And to show the next generation that we haven\u2019t forgot how hard people have fought for human rights. We cannot do this. We can\u2019t go back.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip from The Tonight Show in the video above.\n\n\u2014With a file from the Associated Press", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/katie_scott_img_8302-e1585682373283.png?w=136&h=136&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/shield.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/alert-red.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/shield-blue.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-corus.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/alert.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/morty.svg", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-black.svg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-mobile.svg", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/jimmy-fallon.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/jimmy-fallon.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Scott", "Global News", "Posted August"], "canonical_link": "http://globalnews.ca/news/3671590/jimmy-fallon-charlottesville/", "title": "Jimmy Fallon fights back tears as he speaks about \u2018disgusting\u2019 Charlottesville violence", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Jimmy Fallon fights back tears as he speaks about \u2018disgusting\u2019 Charlottesville violence - National | Globalnews.ca", "description": "\"The fact that it took the president two days to come out and clearly denounce racists and white supremacists is shameful,\" Jimmy Fallon said.", "keywords": "jimmy fallon charlottesville, Charlottesville, charlottesville riots, Charlottesville victim, Donald Trump, Heather Heyer, Jimmy Fallon, jimmy fallon racism, jimmy fallon trump, virginia riots, white nationalist rally, White supremacist rally, Entertainment", "news_keywords": "jimmy fallon charlottesville, Charlottesville, charlottesville riots, Charlottesville victim, Donald Trump, Heather Heyer, Jimmy Fallon, jimmy fallon racism, jimmy fallon trump, virginia riots, white nationalist rally, White supremacist rally, Entertainment", "article": {"tag": "Entertainment"}, "og": {"title": "Jimmy Fallon fights back tears as he speaks about \u2018disgusting\u2019 Charlottesville violence", "description": "\"The fact that it took the president two days to come out and clearly denounce racists and white supremacists is shameful,\" Jimmy Fallon said.", "type": "article", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3671590/jimmy-fallon-charlottesville/", "site_name": "Global News", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/jimmy-fallon.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jimmy Fallon fights back tears as he speaks about \u2018disgusting\u2019 Charlottesville violence", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3671590/jimmy-fallon-charlottesville/", "description": "\"The fact that it took the president two days to come out and clearly denounce racists and white supremacists is shameful,\" Jimmy Fallon said.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@globalnews", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/jimmy-fallon.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 318812448281278, "pages": 91251252807}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3671590/jimmy-fallon-charlottesville/?ia_markup=1"}, "application-name": "Global News", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://globalnews.ca/feed/;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/134ef81f5668dc78080f6bd19ca2310b?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://globalnews.ca", "summary": ""}
