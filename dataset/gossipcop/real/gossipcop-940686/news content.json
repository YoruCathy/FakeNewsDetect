She\u2019s not doing well and doesn\u2019t want to travel, and she\u2019s gone radio silent on me, so I\u2019m just going to step away. The whole thing has been pretty brutal on her, and I hope she can find some peace. \u2014 Joe Rogan (@joerogan) June 1, 2018\n\nBarr originally confirmed her appearance on the podcast while replying to a Twitter user on Tuesday who asked her to \"unpack\" her racist remark, which read, \"Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj,\" referring to Jarrett, who is black and was born in Iran. It has since been deleted.\n\n\"No it wasn't racist,\" Barr, who has reiterated via social media that she's \"not a racist,\" replied. \"I'll talk about it on joe rogan friday.\"\n\nno it wasn't racist-ill talk about it on joe rogan friday \u2014 Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\nThe interview cancellation comes just one day after Barr claimed she \"begged\" ABC executives not to cancel Roseanne.\n\n\"I begged [Disney-ABC Television Group President] Ben Sherwood at ABC to let me apologize and make amend[s],\" she wrote in a now-deleted tweet. \"I begged them not to cancel the show. I told them I was willing to do anything and asked for help in making things right. I'd worked doing publicity for them for free for weeks, traveling, thru bronchitis. I begged for people's jobs.\"\n\nShe also previously noted that she's considering \"fighting back\" against the decision, tweeting, \"I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to you.\"\n\nSee photos from the \"Roseanne\" revival:\n\n\n\n23 PHOTOS 'Roseanne' revival See Gallery 'Roseanne' revival ROSEANNE - 'Go Cubs' - The Conners can't pay their Wi-Fi bill, so they befriend their new neighbors to use the internet for Mary to Skype with mom Geena, who is stationed in Afghanistan.
