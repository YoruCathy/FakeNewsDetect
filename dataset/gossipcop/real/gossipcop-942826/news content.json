But we didn\u2019t think much of it.\u201d\n\nBourdain and Ripert had also eaten breakfast together each morning, again at the Winstub\u2019s big, distressed-wood tables.\n\n\u201cFresh bread, Viennese pastries, kouglof, panacota verrines, dried fruits,\u201d the hotel lists as breakfast offerings. \u201cDried fruits, cold cuts, local cheese, fruit salad, butter, honey and a jar of Christine Ferber jam.\u201d\n\nBut again, on Friday morning, Bourdain didn\u2019t join him at the table.\n\n\u201cHis friend was waiting at breakfast,\u201d the waiter told the Times.\n\n\u201cAnd waiting and waiting.\u201d\n\nAlso waiting, just down the road, was Bourdain\u2019s camera crew.\n\nMaster butcher Christine Speisser told People magazine Saturday that the crew had set up to film at an outdoor market in nearby Strasbourg.\n\nSpeisser was to show Bourdain around the market, starting at 10 a.m.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was something exceptional,\u201d she told People.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to receive chef Bourdain.\n\n\u201cPeople knew he was coming to the market, and everything was in place, ready to film,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018He is the last person in the world I\u2019d imagine to do something like that.\u2019\n\nBut back at the hotel, Bourdain wasn\u2019t picking up his cellphone. It was 9:30 a.m.\n\nRipert got up from his table at the Winstub, where he had been set to choose from among the breads, pastries and local cheeses with his good friend.\n\nFrench authorities say a receptionist \u00adunlocked Bourdain\u2019s hotel room door.\n\nInside, the 61-year-old TV host had used the belt of his hotel bathrobe to hang himself in his bathroom.\n\nRipert found him \u201cunresponsive,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nThere were no other signs of violence to Bourdain\u2019s body, local prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny said Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere is no element that makes us suspect that someone came into the room at any moment,\u201d the prosecutor added.\n\nDe Rocquigny also noted that the suicide appeared to have been an \u201cimpulsive act.\u201d\n\nBlood was drawn from the body, and results of screenings for drugs or other toxins will follow in coming days.\n\n\u201cThis is solely to give the family more information about the motivations and the cause of death,\u201d de Rocquigny said of the screenings.\n\n\u201cWe have no indication that he was consuming alcohol the days before his death or changed his behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cA visionary,\u201d Nasti, the Chambard chef, would say Saturday of his lost guest and friend, offering his condolences to Bourdain\u2019s family \u201cand all those around the world who he caused to dream.\u201d\n\nOver at the outdoor market, Speisser continued to wait.\n\nThen a production assistant rushed to the scene, announcing, \u201cThere\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like they were all struck by lightning,\u201d Speisser told People magazine Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey all just sat on the ground.\u201d\n\nAn hour would pass.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say what was happening. They probably didn\u2019t know everything,\u201d Speisser\u2019s friend Christelle Schenck, who had been there to help with the filming, told People.\n\nFinally, \u201capparently, they need to cancel, we were told,\u201d Schenck said.\n\n\u201cThey said we\u2019ll call you back.\u201d\n\nThe crew packed up and left the market.\n\nReached by The Post on Saturday, Bourdain\u2019s mother, Gladys, 83, a longtime Times editor, could barely speak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really too difficult,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe was an incredible guy. I really can\u2019t talk about him \u2026 He was brilliant and sharp and funny,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe is the last person in the world I\u2019d imagine to do something like that.\u201d\n\nStill, by many accounts, including Ripert\u2019s, Bourdain had not been himself.\n\nThere was exhaustion \u2014 and darkness.\n\nGladys Bourdain recalled Ripert telling her that \u201cTony had been in a dark mood these past couple of days,\u201d Ripert told Bourdain\u2019s mother Friday, according to the Times.\n\nAnthony Bourdain had reportedly kept a brutal work schedule filming \u201cParts Unknown\u201d in the months before his death and was \u201cabsolutely exhausted,\u201d a source told People.\n\n\u201c\u200bHis travel schedule was grueling, and he often seemed quite beat-up from it, as anyone would be,\u201d said the source, described by the magazine as having worked closely with Bourdain in the past year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d put everything into the shoots and then go back to his room to \u00adisolate.\u201d\n\nTributes to Bourdain continued to pour in from around the world Saturday.\n\nHe had been a devoted student of jiujitsu. Champion Lucas \u00adLepri, who trained Bourdain at his home in the Hamptons, recalled how his student surprised him one day with a home-cooked meal inspired by Lepri\u2019s native Brazil.\n\n\u201cI was really moved because he cooked me a feijoada, which is a very special dish from Brazil, made with black beans and pork,\u201d Lepri recalled.\n\n\u201cYou have to be really devoted to cook a good feijoada, because you need to simmer the beans all day.\n\n\u201cTony\u2019s feijoada was incredible. He knew everything about Brazil and Brazilian food, and had traveled all over the country. He told me that the greatest Brazilian chefs came from Minas Gerais, my home state. He really moved me. I\u2019ll never forget him.\u201d\n\nJason Merder, Bourdain\u2019s road manager from 2009 to 2013, remembered it wasn\u2019t all fine dining with the celebrity chef.\n\n\u201cOne of the funniest things was Tony\u2019s craving for Popeye\u2019s chicken,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cEvery time we flew through Atlanta and had an hour between flights, I would get a look from him. And I was like, \u2018All right, man, we\u2019re going to Popeye\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt happened every single day, and it didn\u2019t matter what time of day it was.\u201d\n\nMarilyn Hagerty was an octogenarian columnist for the Grand Forks Herald when her 2012 rave review for a new Olive Garden in her small South Dakota town went viral.\n\nAs trolls pounced, it was Bourdain who \u201ccame to my rescue,\u201d she recalled.\n\nHe flew her to New York City, where they had coffee.\n\n\u201cHe said he came to realize that what I do is a reflection of how people eat,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd he surprised her, too.\n\n\u201cI found him to be not a wild, reckless character of a person, as I had expected,\u201d Hagerty told Time magazine. \u201cHe was nothing but kind and a gentleman.\u201d\n\nRelated Video Video length 1 minute 38 seconds 1:38 How Anthony Bourdain\u2019s daughter and ex are grieving How Anthony Bourdain\u2019s daughter and ex are grieving\n\nAdditional reporting by Georgett Roberts, Kirsten \u00adFleming, Lauren Steussy, Dana Schuster and wire services", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gettyimages-868225814.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gettyimages-868225814.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gettyimages-868225814.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/06/09/the-troubling-signs-leading-up-to-anthony-bourdains-suicide/", "title": "The troubling signs leading up to Anthony Bourdain\u2019s suicide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
