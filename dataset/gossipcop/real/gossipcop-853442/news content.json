So, after this happened, I was devastated. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I was just trying to have fun.\u201d\n\nIn September, Fallon had Trump as a guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d In the now infamous interview, the host asked Trump if he could ruffle his hair.\n\nSee Video: Donald Trump Lets Jimmy Fallon Mess Up His Famous Hairdon't\n\nFallon faced a lot of backlash for playing with Trump\u2019s hair, with many commenting on how Fallon shouldn\u2019t have let Trump off the hook for his racist and sexist comments while on the campaign trail. He was also widely criticized for being too soft on the divisive then-presidential candidate, with many accusing Fallon of \u201cnormalizing\u201d Trump. Comedian Billy Eichner, for example, slammed Fallon, saying it wasn\u2019t \u201ca good moment.\u201d\n\nFallon defended the interview, saying \u201cHave you seen my show? I\u2019m never too hard on anyone. We\u2019ll have Hillary [Clinton] on tomorrow, and we\u2019ll do something fun with her too.\u201d\n\nNow, Fallon said he didn\u2019t play with Trump\u2019s hair to \u201chumanize him\u201d \u2014 in fact, he \u201che did it to minimize him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that would be a compliment: \u2018He did the thing that we all wanted to do,'\u201d Fallon explained.\n\nAlso Read: David Letterman Criticizes Jimmy Fallon for Being Too Soft on Trump: 'You Have an Obligation'\n\nIn the interview, Fallon remembered how the hate after the interview felt inescapable.\n\n\u201cI go, I just can\u2019t read Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I can\u2019t read the news. I can\u2019t read the internet.\u201d\n\nFallon said he understands now that he should\u2019ve talked about it on air when the backlash didn\u2019t subside, even after a couple of days: \u201cI didn\u2019t talk about it, and I should have talked about it. I regret that.\u201d\n\nAnd although he was upset that people didn\u2019t like his Trump interview, that event wasn\u2019t going to force him to make changes at \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d Because in the end, Fallon explained, he wants his show to be where people get their entertainment and their laughs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be bullied into not being me, and not doing what I think is funny,\u201d he said more defiantly. \u201cJust because some people bash me on Twitter, it\u2019s not going to change my humor or my show.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018The Jimmy Fallon Show.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018The Tonight Show.'\u201d\n\nRead the full New York Times interview here.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/JoshGad-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jimmy-Fallon-Finger-Injury.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/la-na-jimmy-fallon-donald-trump-hair-photo-20160915.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tina-Fey-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Jimmy-Fallon-Anne-Hathaway-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/la-na-jimmy-fallon-donald-trump-hair-photo-20160915.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Tony Maglio", "Ross A.
