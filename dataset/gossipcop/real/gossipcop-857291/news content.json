Well, friends, the day has arrived. Today, we're very proud to introduce you to the latest Glossier product: Boy Brow!\n\nAs Annie said roughly a month ago, there's no such thing as the Perfect Brow. We're in the midst of a revolution\u2014a revolution that states that the best brows are the brows you were born with. Reference points include Cara Delevingne (obviously), backstage beauty of the last, oh, three years, and all these boys, hence the name. The look is fluffy, full, and untouched. Even if you were among the population affected by the Great Overpluck of the 1990s, you too can get back to the brow nature intended you to have. You just need a product that cares as much about your brows as you do.\n\nBoy Brow is about working with what you've got. It's a creamy, conditioning pomade (inspired by old-fashioned mustache wax) that, when brushed on with a tiny little precision-minded spoolie, fluffs up brow hairs and keeps them there all day with flexible hold\u2014no crunchy gel vibes. \u201cThis is actually life-changing,\u201d a friend who previewed it wrote us. \u201cGoodbye droopy flaccid brows. Sorry for the flaccid visual so early on a Monday,\u201d\n\nGlossier.com currently offers three shades\u2014blond, brown, and black\u2014all with very sheer pigment loads, to subtly fill in without leaving you looking like Groucho Marx. This is an uncomplicated product that adapts uniquely to you, for a look that we might describe as, simply, \u201cpolished,\u201d Or, more effusively, \u201cOlsen-twin-esque,\u201d\n\nUsing Boy Brow is as simple as the name\u2014just brush upward and outward, paying special attention to training those center \u201csprouts' to lean in. But videos are always helpful, so check out the below. Good brows can be easy. You've just got to believe.\n\nPhoto by S tephanie Dinkel. Video by Yvonne Jukes.
