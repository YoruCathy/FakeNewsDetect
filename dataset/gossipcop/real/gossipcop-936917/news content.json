But why didn't the Hollywood couple make it Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's nuptials?\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan tied the knot, George and Amal had one of the best views of the couple in St. George's Chapel. Sitting in the left choir with Meghan's friends and family, the Clooneys made a big impact at the wedding, and it was thought that they'd also be putting in an appearance at Eugenie and Jack's big day.\n\nHowever, George and Amal were noticeably absent from the second royal wedding of 2018, which was attended by celebs including Demi Moore, Liv Tyler, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell.\n\nWPA Pool Getty Images\n\nDespite not attending the wedding, George Clooney knows Princess Eugenie's husband well. Brooksbank became the UK's brand ambassador for Casamigos in 2016, which is a tequila company Clooney co-founded with Cindy Crawford's husband, Rande Gerber. While Gerber and Clooney sold their tequila company for $1 billion in 2017 (per People), it's thought that Clooney and Brooksbank are still friends.\n\nIt's now been revealed that Amal was unable to attend Princess Eugenie's wedding because she was giving a talk at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women on the same day:\n\nOuzounova/Splash / SplashNews.com Splash News\n\nIt's unclear why George couldn't make it to Princess Eugenie's royal wedding, but it could have something to do with the actor's current business ventures. Just this week it was announced that Clooney had signed a new TV deal with Paramount. The actor has recently been directing episodes of his new Catch 22 adaptation for the studio, with the series now in post-production.\n\nDespite the Clooneys being absent, Brooksbank previously revealed to the Daily Mail that they'd still be serving tequila at the royal wedding: \"I\u2019m in charge of drinks, and we\u2019ll be serving Casamigos,\" he told them.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/princesseugeniejackbrooksbankgeorgeclooney-1539021660.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-amal-clooney-1012-splash-index-1539355984.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-princess-eugenie-gettyimages-1051960796-index-1539364360.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-amal-clooney-1012-splash-index-1539355984.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23733914/princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-george-amal-clooney/", "title": "Why George and Amal Clooney Didn't Attend Princess Eugenie's Wedding", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Amal Missed Eugenie's Wedding to Speak at a Women's Conference", "description": "They skipped the second royal wedding of 2018.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23733914/princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-george-amal-clooney/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-amal-clooney-1012-splash-index-1539355984.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-10-12 02:55:37", "published_time": "2018-10-12 12:02:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-amal-clooney-1012-splash-index-1539355984.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Why George and Amal Clooney Didn't Attend Princess Eugenie's Wedding", "description": "George and Amal Clooney famously stepped out for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding back in May 2018.
