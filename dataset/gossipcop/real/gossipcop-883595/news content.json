After Hurricane Irma and Maria swept through the Carribean islands leaving the entire nation of Puerto Rico without power, Jennifer announced her pledge of $1 million to the victims in the country.\n\nIn her post today, Tomas said, \u201cI\u2019ll never forget how good she\u2019s been to us\u201d and especially to his brother. Her aunt continues by saying, ever since the beginning, Jen has shown so much love and compassion for those in distress.\n\nShe added that, although she never had time to get to know her superstar cousin, Adela will always remember the friendly three-year-old girl who cared about everyone around her.\n\nAfter a long 6 days we found the last of the family! Now the rebuilding begins!! #tiotom\u00e1s #titiadela #familia #puertorico #unidosporpuertorico #LOVE #lovemakestheworldgoround #TioNegroImissyou A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Sep 27, 2017 at 2:58pm PDT\n\nIn her post, Lopez wrote after six long days they found her family, so the \u201crebuilding\u201d begins. On Wednesday, Marc Anthony and Lopez announced the creation of an organization called Somos Una Vos which means \u201cWe\u2019re One Voice\u201d in Spanish.\n\nThe alliance features some of the biggest names in arts, sports, and celebrities in Hollywood and offers humanitarian relief to those in need.\n\nAs CI readers know, this year has proven to be particularly deadly as hurricane season in 2017 ravaged through not only several Caribbean Islands but Houston, Texas as well. The governor of Texas previously said the bill would be billions of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe administration for disaster relief in the United States said Texas should not rely on federal funds for the rebuilding of the destroyed city. Not only has there been hurricanes this year, but Mexico suffered its own disaster in the form of an earthquake. The catastrophe in Mexico City led to the death of over one hundred people.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jennifer-Lopez-The-Famous-People-.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennier-Lopez-SevenStarsWorld.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-alex-rodriguez-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ayesha-curry-son-jlo-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jennifer-Lopez-The-Famous-People-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jennifer-lopez-finally-hears-from-her-family-in-puerto-rico-71570/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Finally Hears From Her Family In Puerto Rico", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "hurricane irma, hurricane maria, jennifer lopez, puerto rico,", "keywords": "celebrity news, hurricane irma, hurricane maria, jennifer lopez, puerto rico,", "description": "Jennifer Lopez finally heard from her family in Puerto Rico after she announced during a press conference that she hadn't heard from them in weeks!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Finally Hears From Her Family In Puerto Rico", "description": "Jennifer Lopez finally heard from her family in Puerto Rico after she announced during a press conference that she hadn't heard from them in weeks!", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jennifer-lopez-finally-hears-from-her-family-in-puerto-rico-71570/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Jennifer-Lopez-The-Famous-People-.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-28", "modified_time": "2017-09-28", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/bridgethill/", "section": "Music", "tag": "puerto rico"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506528000.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
