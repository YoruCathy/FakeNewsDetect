Turns out the Ralph Lauren Collection look actually represents a full circle version of the This Is Us star's career resurgence (maybe like Winona Ryder's comeback hair?).\n\nMoore's stylist Erica Cloud explained it all to People, noting that the fashion house recreated the same Ralph Lauren dress Moore wore to LA premier of Saved in 2004 when she was just 20 years old. Moore even tried on the original dress, just to get the perfect fit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very symbolic of her rebirth,\u201d Cloud said about the whole design process. \u201cIt was such a cool look then, we thought, \u2018Why not revisit it now?\u2019 It\u2019s a beautiful, elegant silhouette. For her, I think it shows she\u2019s still herself, but just an updated version.\"\n\nHere's the original gown. See the resemblance?\n\nMaybe the biggest update is Moore's very 2017 beauty look. She turned to very hip LA sisters and beauty gurus Ashley Streicher and Jenn Streicher for her hair and makeup yesterday.\n\nMandy's nude pout involved a layer of Laura Mercier Lip Pencil in Chestnut, with Laura Mercier Velour Extreme Matte Lipstick in Vibe applied on top. Her smoky copper eye involved a wash of Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Copper up to the crease of her eyelid, with Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Peacock as a pop of blue color in the corner of her eyes. On her nails, she wore Essie's Mademoiselle nail polish.\n\nTo get those bouncy curls, Ashley wrapped Moore's blow-dried hair in 1.25-inch velcro rollers and sprayed it with Garnier Fructis Style Full Control Anti-Humidity Aerosol Hairspray. After 20 minutes, Ashley took out the rollers, brushed out the curls with a boar bristle brush and hit it again with the hairspray. She brushed back one side and pinned it behind Moore's ear, then finished the look with Garnier Fructis Style Texture Tease Dry Touch Finishing Spray.\n\nSo classic Hollywood! She could \u2014 and should \u2014 keep re-doing this look every decade.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-02/bravoleb-reunion-looks.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-01/bravoleb-home-tours.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/most-wanted-kyle-richards-beauty-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/most-wanted-mandy-moore-golden-globes-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-mandy-moore-sag-01.jpg?itok=fm2MTkZN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-01/patricia-altschul-new-puppy-dog.jpg?itok=g3Q4AmCC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/mike-shouhed-haircut.jpg?itok=bzMrkjzh", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-mandy-moore-sag-02.jpg?itok=YrtR94VZ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/lookbook-amanda-kyle-engaged-promote.jpg?itok=X_TG6yAi", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-04/rhobh-interview-looks-season-10.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/bravo-coronavirus-quarantine-check-in.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/bravoleb-diet-playlist.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kenya-moore-rhoa-reunion-drama.jpg?itok=bgjJlU7e", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/paige-desorbo-rich-sweatpants.jpg?itok=gtblaenY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/lookbook-mandy-moore-sag-promote.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/lookbook-mandy-moore-sag-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/lookbook/mandy-moore-2018-sag-awards-dress-secret-meaning", "title": "There's a Secret Meaning Behind Mandy Moore's Strappy Blue SAG Awards Gown", "meta_data": {"title": "Mandy Moore SAG Awards Look Inspired by a Dress from 2004 | Style & Living", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "Mandy Moore's serene blue sequin\u00a0gown from yesterday's Screen Actors Guild Awards is so much more than a pretty dress.
