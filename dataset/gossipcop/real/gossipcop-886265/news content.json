Tuesday night.\n\nHemsworth said he brought his Thor: Ragnarok co-star Mark Ruffalo and director Taika Waititi with him to the show. When Kimmel cut to the green room to see Ruffalo and Waititi, Damon sneaked into their shot.\n\nImmediately trying to have the camera ignore Damon, Kimmel yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s the mighty Thor, not the mighty bore!\u201d Kimmel then explained to Ruffalo and Waititi that Damon isn\u2019t allowed to go into his show\u2019s guest room, for he has his own room to stay in. \u201cThey have snacks in here,\u201d Damon tells the camera.\n\nWhile Ruffalo and Waititi continue to discuss the film, Damon reappeared, telling Kimmel, \u201cI\u2019m on the show! This is what movie actors look like right here. We didn\u2019t ride Adam Carolla's coattails,\" a jab directed at the late-night host.\n\nKimmel soon cuts the camera, leading Hemsworth to say he \u201cdid not invite [Matt Damon].\u201d \u201cI mean I\u2019m friends with him, but I feel sorry for him,\" Hemsworth explained. \"He has nothing. I saw a friend in need and decided to extend the handshake.\"\n\nWhen Kimmel asked whether he went on vacations with Damon, Hemsworth emphasized that it wasn't his choice. \u201cWell he turned up at my house in Australia, uninvited,\u201d Hemsworth joked to the late-night host. Hemsworth explained that Damon also brings along his kids, which he doesn\u2019t mind because he \u201cprefers them better.\u201d\n\nDamon then appeared on the green screen onstage behind Kimmel saying, \u201cI hacked into the system! I\u2019ve been here a really long time, Jimmy \u2026 decades. \u2026 I\u2019ve learned a lot of stuff.\u201d\n\nKimmel then yells for the actor to return backstage to eat the potatoes they left for him, leaving Damon to pretend to take a bite out of Kimmel from behind.\n\n\u201cPut up the emergency screen saver,\u201d Kimmel instructed his crew, as an image of Damon and Michael Douglas in Behind the Candelabra appeared.\n\nThe comedy bit marks the latest installment in the mock feud existing between Kimmel and Damon, which has lasted for more than a decade.\n\nDamon did not comment on Harvey Weinstein during his Kimmel appearance, even though the actor has appeared in several of Weinstein's films, including Good Will Hunting, Chasing Amy, Dogma, The Brothers Grimm and Rounders.", "images": ["https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/matt_damon_ruins_chris_hemsworth_interview_-screen_shot_0.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/matt_damon_ruins_chris_hemsworth_interview_-screen_shot_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez", "Lexy.Perez Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-damon-interrupts-chris-hemsworths-interview-jimmy-kimmel-1047696", "title": "Matt Damon Interrupts Chris Hemsworth's Interview with Jimmy Kimmel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The appearance marks the latest installment in the actor and host's ongoing mock feud.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-damon-interrupts-chris-hemsworths-interview-jimmy-kimmel-1047696", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Matt Damon Interrupts Chris Hemsworth's Interview with Jimmy Kimmel", "description": "The appearance marks the latest installment in the actor and host's ongoing mock feud.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/10/matt_damon_ruins_chris_hemsworth_interview_-screen_shot_0.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Matt Damon Interrupts Chris Hemsworth's Interview with Jimmy Kimmel", "description": "The appearance marks the latest installment in the actor and host's ongoing mock feud.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matt-damon-interrupts-chris-hemsworths-interview-jimmy-kimmel-1047696", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/matt_damon_ruins_chris_hemsworth_interview_-screen_shot_0.jpg", "width": 928, "height": 523, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Matt Damon Interrupts Chris Hemsworth's Interview with Jimmy Kimmel", "sailthru.description": "The appearance marks the latest installment in the actor and host's ongoing mock feud.", "sailthru.author": "Lexy Perez", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-11 10:08:08", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Chris Hemsworth,Jimmy Kimmel,Mark Ruffalo,Matt Damon,Jimmy Kimmel Live!,Late-Night TV"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507687688.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
