And I definitely never doubted her ability to win another Grand Slam title one year \u2014 almost to the day \u2014 of becoming a mom. She is a superstar athlete who does everything with one goal in mind: winning. Perhaps that\u2019s why, in previous years, it never crossed my mind that Serena is just like me. But as she opened up about pregnancy, her harrowing birth story and the vulnerability of motherhood, we all started to feel that way. Last week, on the eve of her return to the U.S. Open, I sat down with Williams on \"Today\" to talk about her Grand Slam goals, embracing her critics and how she works through \"mom guilt\" with the help a few million friends on social media. Do you feel joyful? Williams: You know, I feel a different joy. I've always been this joyful person, but now it's just totally different. I feel just light. I feel lighter and happier. And it's just a great feeling.

She had just given birth to Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. by cesarean section and faced life-threatening complications from a pulmonary embolism and blood clotting. She would be bedridden for six weeks. One year later, she is back on the U.S. Open courts, attempting to tie Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 Grand Slam titles. Her return, which has included a run to the Wimbledon final in July, should be surprising to exactly no one. Williams has joined a league of simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary women, those who return to work after childbirth and quickly perform at a very high level. Elite athletes just have a different kind of office environment awaiting them. In 1960, two years after giving birth to her daughter, the sprinter Wilma Rudolph won three gold medals at the Rome Olympics. Sheryl Swoopes returned to the basketball court six weeks after giving birth to her son. She led the Houston Comets to the 1997 W.N.B.A. championship. The Scottish golfer Catriona Matthew won the Women\u2019s British Open in August 2009, 10 weeks after giving birth to her second daughter. The British heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill gave birth to her first son in July 2014. She won gold at the world championships 13 months later. Because of a lack of scientific data, there are few studies on elite athletes who give birth and return to the highest levels of competition soon thereafter, said Miho Tanaka\u200b, director of the women\u2019s sports medicine program at Johns Hopkins. When it comes to following medical advice, these athletes must look toward individualized recommendations and their innate ability to be hyper-aware of their own bodies. Whatever attributes allow elite athletes to get to their level of fitness and bounce back from injury with greater speed can surely help them return to sport after childbirth, Tanaka said. \u201cBut what that mechanism is \u2014 whether that\u2019s physical or mental, or both \u2014 that formula would be hard to translate.\u201d Cordelia Carter, director of the Women\u2019s Sports Medicine Center at N.Y.U. Langone Health, said Williams had an uncomplicated pregnancy but a very complicated postpartum period, and she continues to achieve above and beyond what many, rightly or wrongly, thought was possible. \u201cSo looking at her, we don\u2019t yet know our limits, which is powerful,\u201d she said.

Extraordinary and Ordinary All at Once.\n\nAccompanied by her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, the tennis superstar made her grand entrance rocking an asymmetrical pink Versace dress, matching pink hat, Bulgari necklace and long braids. Williams shared live Instagram updates of herself and Ohanian getting ready throughout the morning, giving fans sneak peaks of her outfit and poking fun at her husband\u2019s high-waisted trousers. \u201cHey y\u2019all, so my friend\u2019s getting married,\u201d she gushed over Markle. \u201cI\u2019m up super early\u2014well, for me. I\u2019ve known her for so many years and I\u2019m so happy for her.\u201d Williams and Markle have been friends since meeting at the 2010 Super Bowl in Miami. \u201cI just think it\u2019s so important to enjoy the moment,\u201d Williams recently told Good Morning America of Markle\u2019s big day. \u201cAnd eat the cake\u2014I didn\u2019t get to eat mine at the wedding. We were just having so much fun!\u201d Read more at: Serena Williams has officially arrived at Windsor Castle\n\nAs I\u2019m writing the introduction to this story, the news breaks that Serena Williams has pulled out of the French Open with a pectoral injury. She\u2019s getting an MRI, and the prognosis is uncertain: Williams could be OK in two weeks, or she might not be better in time for Wimbledon, which starts soon. Sports injuries\u2014and in Williams\u2019s case, tightly calibrated comebacks (after the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia, last year)\u2014can turn on a dime. But that\u2019s what badasses do; they keep at it. And Williams, of course, has badass in her bones. She first picked up a racket when she was 3 and has been serving, literally, ever since. Men\u2019s champion Roger Federer recently called her the greatest player of all time. I caught up with Williams earlier in the summer, when she was in New York promoting her HBO documentary, Being Serena. She was resplendent in a tropical-print Gucci coat, eating quite the oddest collection of food I\u2019d ever seen on one plate (crab ... and cake). Because, yes, she is a champion, a mother, a wife, and an inspiration, but Serena is really ... Serena. Read more at: Creating the life of a parent within the legend of a champion\n\nLB: So as you\u2019re the first cover of the Badass issue, what are your tips for being a badass woman? SW: You have to be confident. Someone who\u2019s a badass is incredibly confident and unapologetically herself. And she doesn\u2019t care what anyone else says\u2014but in a positive, not a negative, way. It\u2019s more like standing up for yourself and others. The whole #MeToo movement, those women are badass. They\u2019re not afraid to say what\u2019s wrong and what affected them. LB: When is the first time you remember being unapologetic? SW: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know. It took me a while because I\u2019ve faced so much criticism, whether it was about my body or something else\u2014it was always something. I always felt like I had to be softer or apologize, kind of indirectly, for who I am. And I don\u2019t know when it happened, but something changed. I just became who I am and realized there\u2019s nothing wrong with me. I understand who I am. I\u2019m the most impatient person [laughs]. I\u2019m like, \u201cNow, now, now, now, now!\u201d So I know there\u2019s some room for improvement. LB: What would you say to girls who don\u2019t really feel they have a voice? How would you tell them to be a badass in their family and their community? SW: Being a girl is not easy\u2014in some areas especially. You have to be really brave. And I realize I am saying this from the United States, so I have an opportunity to speak more than the next person\u2014I\u2019m saying that with the understanding that maybe they can\u2019t. It\u2019s really just about being aware and educating yourself so you can help other people be aware. Once you do that, even if you reach one person, that\u2019s more than none.

Treat them the way you would your real hair. \u201cNaturally textured virgin hair extensions should be treated and cared for the same way you\u2019d treat your own natural hair. Regularly washing, moisturizing and detangling your textured hair extensions is key to extending the life of the hair,\u201d advises Opara. Dry your hair well. Dry your hair well. Hair that hasn\u2019t been dried properly can lead to scalp issues, including fungal ones. So if you have thick hair, be sure to clip your hair in sections and dry your braided sections thoroughly. Don\u2019 t neglect your real hair. Don\u2019t neglect your real hair. \u201cHair that hasn\u2019t been maintained under a weave may begin to suffer from breakage or matting when the extensions are removed,\u201d warns Pitters. Remove them in a timely fashion. Remove them in a timely fashion. Extensions will damage your hair if left in too long. Pitters recommends redoing interlock sew-ins every 6 weeks and the braided sew-in version every 8 to 10 weeks. Avoid oils. Avoid oils. If you have glue-on bonded extensions, oils will break down the extension glue. And that is something that you don\u2019t want to happen until you are ready to remove your pieces. Take a break now and then. Take a break now and then. Allow your natural hair and scalp to breathe from time to time. Relieve the stress placed on your hair and scalp by waiting a week or two after removal of your extensions before getting them replaced.

A fifties-themed baby shower (she loves a theme party, or any excuse to get into costume, really) is in the works. There is the bachelorette party\u2014maybe the islands, maybe Las Vegas, maybe both\u2014and, one of these days, the wedding itself. But most of her energy is directed at preparing the nursery. Williams, a Francophile who keeps an apartment in Paris, is looking for a baby nurse who speaks French and just found a wall hanging of a medieval French poem by Charles d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans for the room. \u201cAlexis thinks we\u2019re having a boy, but I have a strong suspicion that it\u2019s a girl,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo weeks after we found out, I played the Australian Open. I told Alexis it has to be a girl because there I was playing in 100-degree weather, and that baby never gave me any trouble. Ride or die.
