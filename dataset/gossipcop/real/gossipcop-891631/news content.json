The Emmy-winning actress and Seagal costarred in the 1991 film Out for Justice.\n\nA representative for Seagal did not respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment on Friday,\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 23, a casting director, a woman, said, \u2018Steven Seagal wants to go over the scene with you in his hotel room at 10 o\u2019clock at night,'\u201d Margulies told Jenny Hutt for SiriusXM\u2019s Just Jenny on Friday.\n\n\u201cI lived in Brooklyn, and I said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t travel. I don\u2019t have money for a cab.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t. And I said, \u2018And I don\u2019t take subways late at night.\u2019 And she says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll reimburse you. And I\u2019m here, a woman,\u2019 \u201d the E.R. alum recalled. \u201cI got to the hotel at 10:40, and she wasn\u2019t there. And he was. Alone. And he made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life. And I got out of there unscathed.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gary Gershoff/WireImage; Paul Archuleta/Getty\n\nIn late October, Seagal joined the list of major Hollywood figures accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Inside Edition correspondent Lisa Guerrero\u2019s recent accusations against Seagal came nearly a decade after Jenny McCarthy recalled an alleged incident in which he asked her to strip naked for the movie Under Siege 2 during a private audition in 1998.\n\nA spokesman for Seagal previously denied McCarthy\u2019s claims. Representatives for Seagal have not responded to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment regarding any of the claims.\n\nMarguiles also spoke about an alleged past incident with Weinstein.\n\n\u201cI have my own Harvey story, but I never was raped. And I never was harmed. And I don\u2019t know how I got out of that hotel room,\u201d the actress said during her SiriusXM interview. \u201cIt always starts with, \u2018I\u2019m a healer, I want to massage you\u2019 and all. I sorta screamed my way out\u2026But, the point is that for years, years, we all just shrug it off.\u201d\n\nConcluding, \u201cAnd because of my experience with Steven Seagal in that room, which was horrific, I refused to meet Harvey Weinstein in his hotel room when another woman brought me, saying \u2018you will absolutely get [a screen test].\u2019 \u201c\n\nWATCH: Multiple Women Accuse Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein of Sexual Harassment as He Announces Leave of Absence\n\nMargulies emphasized that the discussion of sexual harassment in Hollywood should include the women who enable predatory men. \u201cWho are these women? You know, one of the things I want to stay clear of in this dialogue, collectively with other women and men, is that it\u2019s not always the men that are awful,\u201d Margulies said.\n\nWeinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct in the past couple weeks by more than 50 women, including multiple allegations of assault. (The movie mogul has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.)\n\nMargulies appeared on Just Jenny along with Erin Merryn, a childhood sexual abuse survivor who is fighting for states to pass Erin\u2019s Law, which mandates schools teach sexual abuse awareness and prevention. The issue of sexual abuse \u201cis not to be shrugged off,\u201d Margulies, a longtime advocate for the law, said on the show. \u201cWe have to start with our children.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fjulianna-marguiles-steven-seagal.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fjulianna-marguiles-steven-seagal.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fjulianna-marguiles-steven-seagal.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/julianna-margulies-recalls-alleged-encounter-with-steven-seagal-i-saw-his-gun/", "title": "Julianna Margulies Recalls Alleged Encounter With Steven Seagal: 'I Saw His Gun'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Julianna Margulies,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Steven Seagal", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Julianna Margulies,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Steven Seagal", "description": "\"Because of my experience with Steven Seagal in that room ...
