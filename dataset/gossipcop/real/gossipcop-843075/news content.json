Bachelor in Paradise season 3 lovebirds Grant Kemp and Lace Morris announced in November that they had called off their engagement, and now Kemp gives Us Weekly an exclusive update on how things have been between them since the breakup.\n\nKemp, who is still working as a firefighter and splits his time between San Francisco and Los Angeles, tells Us that he and Morris haven\u2019t had any contact since they ended things. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to Lace ever,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Bachelorette season 12 standout mentions that Morris posted a photo to Instagram last month of herself hanging out with Kemp\u2019s ex-girlfriend Jen Green, who he was dating before he vied for JoJo Fletcher\u2018s affections on the ABC relationship series. Morris captioned the pic, \u201cI think #Jace has a better ring to it, don\u2019t you @jen.not.jenn?\u201d (As Paradise fans know, Morris and Kemp referred to themselves by the nickname \u201cGrace,\u201d a combination of their two first names, and they even got the moniker tattooed on each of their wrists over the summer.)\n\n\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve seen that [Morris is] doing some things to try to get my attention,\u201d Kemp tells Us. \u201cShe\u2019s been hanging out with my ex Jen \u2014 the one who blew me up in the tabloids \u2014 and posting on Instagram. I don\u2019t play those Instagram caption games. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d\n\nKemp says he wishes that he and Morris could remain civil. \u201cI did everything I could to protect her when we did break up,\u201d he continues. \u201cI put out in the media that it was mutual and was respectful enough to do that. It was a very volatile relationship. I definitely still hope for the best for her.\u201d\n\nWould he sign up for another round of Bachelor in Paradise? He says he\u2019s not sure: \u201cIf I met the right girl, it would be awesome, but for me, it\u2019s that fear of not knowing if that girl will actually be there!\u201d\n\nWhen Morris spoke to Us exclusively in January, she said that the split \u201churt\u201d and that she was \u201clooking forward to this year being so much better.\u201d She added, \u201cGrant seemed to move on a little bit quicker than I expected him to after our breakup, so I was a little shocked by that. But I took my time for myself, and I am healthy.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lace-grant-inline-0a2a5485-2c99-41ee-8c1e-19ded5b2a08f.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lace-grant-39a6ea97-f75d-4892-847e-9fa7003b3227.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lace-grant-39a6ea97-f75d-4892-847e-9fa7003b3227.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marisa Sullivan", "Ryan Gajewski"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bachelorettes-grant-kemp-lace-morris-romance-was-volatile-w470397/", "title": "Bachelorette's Grant Kemp: Lace Morris Romance Was 'Volatile'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bachelor in Paradise's Grant Kemp tells Us Weekly exclusively that his romance with Lace Morris was 'very volatile' \u2014 read his comments", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bachelor Nation's Grant Opens Up About Lace Romance: 'Very Volatile'", "description": "Bachelor in Paradise's Grant Kemp tells Us Weekly exclusively that his romance with Lace Morris was 'very volatile' \u2014 read his comments", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bachelorettes-grant-kemp-lace-morris-romance-was-volatile-w470397/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:32:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lace-grant-39a6ea97-f75d-4892-847e-9fa7003b3227.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lace-grant-39a6ea97-f75d-4892-847e-9fa7003b3227.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "watch with us", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-03-04T01:52:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:32:24+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bachelor in Paradise's Grant Kemp tells Us Weekly exclusively that his romance with Lace Morris was 'very volatile' \u2014 read his comments", "title": "Bachelor Nation's Grant Opens Up About Lace Romance: 'Very Volatile'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lace-grant-39a6ea97-f75d-4892-847e-9fa7003b3227.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488592320.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
