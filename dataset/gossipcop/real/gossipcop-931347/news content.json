Apparently, Gigi's the one who's not entirely sold.\n\nA source told E! News that \"Zayn really wants to be with [Gigi] and has made it clear. He misses her and can't stand being apart,\" but \"Gigi's a little bit more hesitant.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not that the two don't love each other, the source said, but they broke up for a reason and nothing has changed to make that any different, which is like, the most relatable thing ever. Gigi \"does love him, but she isn't completely sure this is where she wants to be right now.\"\n\nBoth Gigi and Zayn have very demanding careers, and they don't plan on cutting back on those any time soon, which makes maintaining a relationship challenging. \"They are both so busy with their careers and traveling the world. It makes it very difficult to be in a relationship,\" the source said.\n\nStill, they were seen literally making out in public, which isn't exactly low-key? The source confirmed they're \"hanging out.\" \"They aren't officially back together but they are talking and hanging out.\"\n\n\n\nAnother source told E! News that when the couple broke up, Zayn \"was going through a rough time,\" and they both needed space to clear their heads, but that \"space\" didn't last long. \"Zayn reached out to Gigi after a week and they decided to see each other and see how things go,\" \"No love was ever lost between them.\"\n\nSo technically the jury's still out on this one, but there may be more NYC makeout sightings in the future. Stay tuned.\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/4-gigi-hadid-zayn-1498251434.jpg?crop=0.909xw:0.394xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0721xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-and-zayn-1521045944.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0721xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Baty", "Emma Baty Is The Associate Entertainment Editor At Cosmopolitan Who Focuses On Movies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a20134177/gigi-hadid-hesitant-getting-back-together-with-zayn/", "title": "Gigi Hadid Is Reportedly \"Hesitant\" About Getting Back Together With Zayn Malik", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Gigi Hadid Is Reportedly \"Hesitant\" About Getting Back Together With Zayn Malik", "description": "And the reason why is so relatable.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a20134177/gigi-hadid-hesitant-getting-back-together-with-zayn/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0721xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-05-03 01:33:55", "published_time": "2018-05-03 01:33:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0721xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Gigi Hadid Is Hesitant To Get Back Together With Zayn Malik - Zigi Back Together", "description": "The reason why Gigi Hadid might not want to get back together with Zayn Malik is so relatable.", "keywords": "gigi hadid, zayn malik, gigi and zayn, zigi, zigi breakup, zigi reunion, gigi and zayn back together,", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-03T13:33:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0721xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gigi-zayn-1525352985.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Gigi Hadid Is Reportedly \"Hesitant\" About Getting Back Together With Zayn Malik", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525282380.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
