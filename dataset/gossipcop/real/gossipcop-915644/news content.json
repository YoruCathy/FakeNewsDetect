Or is it just me ... ugh this is so sad,\u201d she said. \u201c[S]till love you tho snap ... my first love\u201d.\n\nKylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad.\n\nJenner\u2019s tweet, combined with growing fears on the part of investors that a long-awaited usability-focused redesign may not solve Snapchat\u2019s user growth issues, sparked a plunge in the company\u2019s stock, which fell 6% over the course of Thursday, clearing $1.3bn from its market capitalisation.\n\nThe redesign of the app saw Snapchat move away from its previous split between \u201cmessages\u201d and \u201cstories\u201d, the social media convention invented by the company but usurped by Facebook\u2019s Instagram. Now, Snapchat focuses attention on the division between friends and publishers, allowing it to more easily promote professional (and paid-for) content, while grouping everything from actual acquaintances in one place.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just Snapchat\u2019s celebrity users and investors who have expressed frustration with the new direction the app has taken. A petition from more than 1.2 million users begged the company to reconsider its redesign, eventually forcing a somewhat dismissive response from Snap Inc itself.\n\n\u201cWe completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many,\u201d the company said. However, it added, \u201cthis new foundation is just the beginning and we will always listen closely to find new ways to make the service better for everyone\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe petition\u2019s core complaint is that the new update \u201chas not made the app easier to use, but has in fact made many features more difficult \u2026 Many \u2018new features\u2019 are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years.\u201d\n\nIn the run up to the redesign, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel promised it would satisfy concerns (particularly among investors) that Snapchat was too difficult to use. But he also hoped that the redesign could help fix some common problems faced by all social media apps, he told the Guardian before the launch.\n\n\u201cFor a very long time, we have been trying to clarify, or at least distinguish, the difference between friends and publishers,\u201d Spiegel said in November. \u201cLike, on the Stories page, do you show friends or publishers first? Because our service was really built on this idea of helping friends communicate, we chose friends \u2013 and ultimately what that meant is that all of this awesome publisher content was all the way down at the bottom.\u201d\n\nDespite the criticism, Spiegel remains characteristically bolshy about the new design, telling a conference in San Francisco that \u201csome of the complaints we\u2019re seeing reinforce the philosophy.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the complaints we got was, \u2018wow I used to feel like this celebrity was my friend and now they don\u2019t feel like my friend anymore\u2019. And we\u2019re like: \u2018Exactly. They\u2019re not your friend.\u2019 So for us, even some of the frustrations we\u2019re seeing really validate those changes. And it\u2019ll take time for people to adjust.\u201d", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f7c63cfef52aef552e5dca201f97695884fdb9/0_19_2760_1657/master/2760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba632cdd80e4dd1aaf38a8226fe64df2", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Snapchat%2CApps%2CSocial+media%2CDigital+media%2CTechnology%2CMedia%2CKylie+Jenner", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f7c63cfef52aef552e5dca201f97695884fdb9/0_19_2760_1657/master/2760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7d1b7e9691df90f9c0ed86bf5f91015a"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f7c63cfef52aef552e5dca201f97695884fdb9/0_19_2760_1657/master/2760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7d1b7e9691df90f9c0ed86bf5f91015a", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/22/snapchat-redesign-12m-signature-petition-social-media-app-kylie-jenner-celebrities", "title": "Kylie Jenner helps to wipe $1bn from Snapchat with tweet over redesign woes", "meta_data": {"description": "Users rebel against social media app\u2019s new features while celebrities dump platform as it tries to appeal to new users", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Alex Hern", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f7c63cfef52aef552e5dca201f97695884fdb9/0_19_2760_1657/master/2760.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=64989722ba04ead1e7cf948aa92b3f2d", "keywords": "Snapchat,Apps,Social media,Digital media,Technology,Media,Kylie Jenner", "news_keywords": "Snapchat,Apps,Social media,Digital media,Technology,Media,Kylie Jenner", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/22/snapchat-redesign-12m-signature-petition-social-media-app-kylie-jenner-celebrities", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f7c63cfef52aef552e5dca201f97695884fdb9/0_19_2760_1657/master/2760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7d1b7e9691df90f9c0ed86bf5f91015a", "description": "Users rebel against social media app\u2019s new features while celebrities dump platform as it tries to appeal to new users", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner helps to wipe $1bn from Snapchat with tweet over redesign woes", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-hern", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Technology", "published_time": "2018-02-23T09:06:29.000Z", "tag": "Snapchat,Apps,Social media,Digital media,Technology,Media,Kylie Jenner", "modified_time": "2019-04-01T17:04:44.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://technology/2018/feb/22/snapchat-redesign-12m-signature-petition-social-media-app-kylie-jenner-celebrities?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://technology/2018/feb/22/snapchat-redesign-12m-signature-petition-social-media-app-kylie-jenner-celebrities?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/22/snapchat-redesign-12m-signature-petition-social-media-app-kylie-jenner-celebrities", "iphone": "gnmguardian://technology/2018/feb/22/snapchat-redesign-12m-signature-petition-social-media-app-kylie-jenner-celebrities?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f7c63cfef52aef552e5dca201f97695884fdb9/0_19_2760_1657/master/2760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=fe6425f12d0fef3431988fd3a9f8b39c", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@alexhern", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519228800.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
