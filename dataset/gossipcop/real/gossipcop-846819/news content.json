I did it in one day.\n\nLet me explain: My father\u2019s best friend since summer camp, \u201cUncle\u201d John, had known Jason and me separately our whole lives, but Jason and I had never met. I went to college out east and took my first job in California. When I moved back home to Chicago, John \u2014 who thought Jason and I were perfect for each other \u2014 set us up on a blind date.\n\nIt was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, \u201cUh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.\u201d\n\nBy the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.\n\nJason? He knew a year later.\n\nI have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I\u2019m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.\n\nFirst, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.\n\nThe following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.\n\nHe is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him \u2014 or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes \u2014 know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.\n\nIf our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food \u2014 man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening\u2019s meal.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Krouse Rosenthal"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "title": "You May Want to Marry My Husband", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-03-03T10:00:05.000Z", "modified": "2019-10-17T19:37:59.527Z", "section": "Style", "tag": "Death and Dying", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004959719, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/d47c39b2-bf01-546a-a561-a80fddedb079", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/d5f213910a6b463fbd75e7adca9a528d", "description": "After learning she doesn\u2019t have long to live, a woman composes a dating profile for the man she will leave behind.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Amy Krouse Rosenthal", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "news_keywords": "Love,Marriage,Death", "pdate": 20170303, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "type": "article", "title": "You May Want to Marry My Husband", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "After learning she doesn\u2019t have long to live, a woman composes a dating profile for the man she will leave behind."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "title": "You May Want to Marry My Husband", "description": "After learning she doesn\u2019t have long to live, a woman composes a dating profile for the man she will leave behind.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/31LOVEADVICE-1/05LOVE-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/d47c39b2-bf01-546a-a561-a80fddedb079"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "style", "CN": "modern-love", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/d47c39b2-bf01-546a-a561-a80fddedb079", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488470400.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
