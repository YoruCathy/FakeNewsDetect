The former Disney Channel star has never shied away from being herself, and talking about her past. In fact, Miley Cyrus is full on embracing her Hannah Montana days. Everyone, of course, is obsessed with this new era, but none of us will ever forget how she got her big break and neither will she, which she gushed about on The Howard Stern Show.\n\n\"They cast someone, besides me, first. And they even did a pilot without me and then they said it didn\u2019t work,\" Miley said. \"I love that I was f\u2014ing Hannah Montana. That\u2019s what the song 'Younger Now' on my album is about. It says, 'Even though it\u2019s not who I am, I\u2019m not afraid of who I used to be.'\"\n\nMiley also spoke on [CBS Sunday Morning](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5029947/Miley-Cyrus-says-Hannah-Montana-lot-kid.html?ito=social-twitterdailymailceleb)_ about why she thinks everyone loved the character Hannah Montana. \"I think why people loved [it] was because Hannah Montana did feel real, and that's because I was under there. And people forgot that sometimes. I loved being that character and that's what made people love her\u2026That was great music for kids to listen to. There's a song called Life's What You Make it, so Let's Make it Rock. Never forget that \u2013 wise words. That's a good thing to tell kids.\"\n\nHowever, living this sort of double life wasn't always easy. Miley said,\"It's a lot to put on a kid to have them have get their make-up done and then also balance school\u2026It got harder when I started touring as both \u2013 I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself. I think that's probably what's a little bit wrong with me now! I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.\"\n\nThere were subtle hints to her past in the in the \"Younger Now\" music video that fans picked up on, and as the singer recently told MTV News, none of them were actually intentional funny enough.\n\n\"Even though I wasn't intentionally trying to reenact something I had already done, it just naturally happened, because that's a part of me too,\" Miley said. One other thing fans have picked up on from the \"Younger Now\" new video is the similarities to Hannah Montana: The Movie\u2019s beloved \"Hoedown Throwdown.\" Especially in the group dance sequence, and of course social media couldn't help but make note of it.\n\n13.

I am stoked that that was a part of my life,\u201d she continued to MTV. \"I'm not afraid of who I used to be. No one stays the same.\"\n\nThis is a bit of a different tune than the one she was singing a few months ago when talking about how embarrassed she was of her \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d music video. Miley is definitely right, no one stays the same and we honestly we;re all ~living~ for this new musical era.\n\nLove J-14?
