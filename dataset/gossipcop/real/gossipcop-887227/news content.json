After drug-sniffing dogs detected the substance, agents discovered marijuana oil, according to TMZ.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nEtheridge told police that she uses the drug to manage pain from cancer. Although the drug is legal in California, however, it\u2019s not allowed in North Dakota, said TMZ.\n\nThe \u201cCome to My Window\u201d crooner was reportedly booked for possession of a controlled substance and smiled from ear-to-ear in her mugshot, which was obtained by TMZ. According to the outlet, she pleaded not guilty. PEOPLE\u2019s requests for comment were not immediately returned by CBP or a rep for Etheridge.\n\nEtheridge first opened up about her weed use in the new Yahoo! project Cannabis & the American Family, and PEOPLE premiered the video clip earlier this year. The Grammy-winner explained that she began using medical marijuana as a holistic alternative to pharmaceuticals when she was undergoing chemotherapy after her 2004 breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nDuring the initial interview, she added that she has smoked with her wife, Linda Wallem, and two older kids: Bailey, 20, and Beckett, 18. \u201cIt\u2019s a very natural, end-of-the-day [thing],\u201d she told Yahoo! \u201cAnd it brings you much closer. I\u2019d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink \u2014 oh, God, no.\u201d\n\nSince her quotes made the rounds online, Etheridge said she\u2019s received flak for her parenting style and would hope the attention would be directed to a more important issue.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Melissa Etheridge\u2019s Music Room Is the Coolest\n\nEtheridge later clarified her comments exclusively to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a celebrity here for almost 30 years, and I\u2019ve done my best to speak truthfully about who I am and my human experience as I go through life, from my work to my family,\u201d the rocker said. \u201cSometimes I find that I can say something, thinking that the whole world will understand, and they kind of go in another direction. I think if I get a little more specific, it can help guide the conversation in general about cannabis.\u201d\n\nEtheridge discussed why she believes her use of cannabis with her children has been \u201cdemonized\u201d \u2014 and opened up about how heartbroken she was over the backlash she received for smoking with her kids.\n\n\u201cMy children are my priority,\u201d said Etheridge, who is also mom to 10-year-old twin daughters Johnnie Rose and Miller Steven. \u201cI love my children. They are four of the most amazing human beings on earth. I live a very blessed life. I would never want to harm any of them.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fmelissa-etheridge.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fmelissa-etheridge.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fmelissa-etheridge.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/melissa-etheridge-posession-of-marijuana/", "title": "Melissa Etheridge Busted for Possession of Marijuana", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Marijuana,Melissa Etheridge,Music News,News", "news_keywords": "Marijuana,Melissa Etheridge,Music News,News", "description": "Melissa Etheridge was returning to the United States from Canada in North Dakota when her tour bus was stopped by Customs and Border Patrol", "og": {"title": "Melissa Etheridge Busted for Possession of Marijuana", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/melissa-etheridge-posession-of-marijuana/", "description": "Melissa Etheridge&nbsp;\u2014 a passionate advocate for medical marijuana \u2014 was busted for drug possession in August.
