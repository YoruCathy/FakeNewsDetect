It\u2019s also a visual encyclopedia collecting several decades\u2019 worth of geek culture. Adapted from the 2011 novel by Ernest Cline, the film takes place in the far-off year of 2045, when humans like hero Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) spend all their time in a digital virtual-reality realm called the OASIS. Within this world, they can freely indulge their obsessions with the movies, TV shows, and video games of the distant past \u2026 the \u201cdistant past\u201d in this case being primarily the \u201980s and \u201990s. Almost every frame of Ready Player One is filled with one (and often many more) references to our collective pop-culture history. The Yahoo Entertainment team put together this list of the 80-plus references we spotted in Ready Player One. Read on and let us know about any sightings we missed in the comments below.\n\nThe A-Team\n\nWe love it when a plan comes together: The GMC van that housed the crack squad of soldiers turned heroes for hire on NBC\u2019s hit 1983-87 series takes part in the opening race challenge designed by OASIS creator James Halliday (Mark Rylance).\n\nAdventure\n\nIf you were the lucky kid in your group of friends who owned an Atari 2600 in the \u201980s, then you definitely had your pals over to try and master this precursor to later open-world quest games like The Legend of Zelda. It\u2019s also notable in gaming history as the first video game to feature a hidden Easter egg: the name of the creator, Warren Robinett. In Ready Player One, Adventure is the last challenge Wade/Parzival faces in his grand adventure to master Halliday\u2019s game.\n\nThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension\n\nW.D. Richter\u2019s 1984 cult favorite bombed at the box office, but it has an army of celebrity fans ranging from Kevin Smith to Ready Player One\u2018s own Ernie Cline. (In fact, Cline even wrote an unproduced sequel script, Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League.) Attempts to revive the character have thus far proved elusive, but maybe Parzival\u2019s choice to dress up as Buckaroo for his \u201cdate\u201d with Art3mis, the online identity of fellow gamer Samantha (Olivia Cooke), will kick-start a long-anticipated Banzai revival.\n\nAkira\n\nA blockbuster in its native Japan, Akira brought anime to America in a big way in 1988. So it\u2019s only natural that Art3mis would make the film\u2019s sleek motorcycle her ride of choice when racing for Halliday\u2019s first key.\n\nAlien\n\nRidley Scott\u2019s 1979 sci-fi classic birthed a franchise that continues to this day in films, video games, and even comic books. The USCSS Nostromo is among the model ships that Parzival\u2019s buddy Aech (Lena Waithe) keeps in her hangar, and a Xenomorph bursts out of Art3mis\u2019s chest when she\u2019s trying to sell Parzival on the importance of a disguise.\n\nAmblin Entertainment\n\nFounded in 1981, Steven Spielberg\u2019s production company is named after the 1968 short film that put him on the path to cinematic idol. The familiar logo of Elliott wheeling E.T. in front of the moon \u2014 borrowed from the director\u2019s 1982 favorite \u2014 opens Ready Player One in a knowing wink at all the references that lie ahead.\n\nAnimal House\n\nJohn Landis\u2019s landmark 1978 collegiate comedy is cited when Wade tries to stump IOI head Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) with deep-cut geek-isms in their first face-to-face meeting.\n\nMarty McFly\u2019s DeLorean from Back to the Future is a major presence in Ready Player One. (Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nBack to the Future\n\nThirty years ago, Steven Spielberg helped pal Robert Zemeckis bring Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny together for Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Now Zemeckis gave his OK for Spielberg to make the Universal-owned Back to the Future franchise (which Spielberg executive-produced) a major presence in the Warner Bros.-released Ready Player One. Not only does Parzival drive Marty McFly\u2019s iconic DeLorean when he\u2019s in the OASIS, but viewers can spot a Doc Brown avatar in the background of one shot, and hear the classic BTTF theme music play when the hero activates the Zemeckis Cube, which can turn the clock back 60 seconds (both RP1 and BTTF were scored by Alan Silvestri). Also, back in the real world, Simon Pegg is totally channeling Christopher Lloyd when he shows up in the final sequence as Halliday\u2019s estranged partner, Ogden Morrow.\n\nBatman\n\nOriginally introduced in 1939, the Caped Crusader arguably remains the world\u2019s most recognizable \u2014 and popular \u2014 costumed crime fighter, battling bad guys in comic books, cartoons, movies, video games, and novels. The Bat symbol adorns stickers that are scattered throughout the movie (including one in Aech\u2019s van) and also appears on the chest of the Dark Knight himself, whose avatar is glimpsed in the OASIS. Batman would be wise to check his utility belt and confirm his keys are still there, as the Batmobile is glimpsed speeding through the New York streets in the opening race. Not just any Batmobile, but the sleek vehicle that Adam West drove in the classic 1966 TV series. Chicks dig the car. The film also features avatars from the classic game series Arkham: Batman.\n\nBattlestar Galactica\n\nAech\u2019s collection of model spaceships includes the good ship Galactica, which carried the survivors of the Cylon attack on the 12 colonies in both the original 1978 TV series and its superior 2004 reboot. So say we all.\n\nBattletoads\n\nWhile they never seriously challenged the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for mutant amphibian supremacy, the Battletoads did wear out the thumbs of millions of NES-era gamers when their nearly impossible game hit shelves in 1991. Flash-forward to the year 2045 and those toads do have some staying power: A Battletoad avatar parties down in the nightclub Parzival and Art3mis visit on their not-date date.\n\nThe Beastmaster\n\nThey just don\u2019t make movies like this bizarre 1982 sword and sorcery flick anymore. That\u2019s why Don Coscarelli\u2019s whacked-out fantasy about a musclebound warrior who can psychically chat with critters big and small is memorialized on a poster strategically placed in the background of the OASIS.\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nMichael Keaton\u2019s ghost with the most from Tim Burton\u2019s beloved supernatural comedy is 30 years young, and looks eternally youthful as an OASIS avatar.\n\nBigfoot\n\nIn addition to classic monsters like King Kong and Jurassic Park\u2018s T. rex, Ready Player One makes room for some classic monster trucks. In Halliday\u2019s speedway chase, Aech is seen driving this classic beast of a vehicle, created by Bob Chandler in 1975 \u2014 the same year that Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws terrified moviegoers.\n\nCentipede\n\nThe 1980 shooter is one of the many Atari 2600 titles that baffle the IOI foot soldiers in Halliday\u2019s final challenge.\n\nView photos The murderous doll Chucky has a killer cameo in Ready Player One. (Photo: Mary Evans/UA/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection) More\n\nChild\u2019s Play\n\nHe\u2019s Chucky \u2014 wanna play? The pint-size star of the Child\u2019s Play series, which started in 1988 and released its latest installment last year, is used as a weapon in the climactic Planet Doom battle.\n\nChristine\n\nTwo horror masters met when John Carpenter adapted Stephen King\u2019s novel about a murderous Plymouth Fury to the big screen. (And unlike with The Shining, the author is mostly happy with the movie.) Christine can be glimpsed alongside the cars at the starting line for Halliday\u2019s crazy race.\n\nCowboy Bebop\n\nLike any self-respecting anime fan, Aech clearly has a deep love for this short-lived late \u201990s cartoon series about a crew of bebopping bounty hunters in outer space. She\u2019s built a replica of the Swordfish II, a speedy racer favored by antihero Spike, in her hanger.\n\nDark Side of the Moon\n\nWhen Sorrento initially contacts Wade to discuss striking a business arrangement, he uses the logo from the landmark 1973 Pink Floyd album as the digital gateway.\n\nDuke Nukem\n\nThe musclebound star of a popular series of \u201990s platform games, Duke Nukem brings his \u201cnuke \u2019em all\u201d battle strategy to a Planet Doom skirmish.\n\nDune\n\nWhen Parzival and Art3mis meet up in Aech\u2019s workshop, he shows her a collection of famous sci-fi ships \u2014 and though we don\u2019t actually see any, he references the Spacefolder ships that transport the great Houses in Frank Herbert\u2019s groundbreaking 1965 novel to the farthest corners of the galaxy. Those ships came to life in David Lynch\u2019s gloriously goofy 1984 film version of Dune and will presumably take flight again in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s planned remake.\n\nDungeons & Dragons\n\nDungeons & Dragons is far less relevant in Spielberg\u2019s film than it was in Cline\u2019s novel. Still, it\u2019s referenced a number of times, including via a background game logo, a 20-sided die in the center of the powerful Orb of Osuvox, the planet Gygax (which is named after the game\u2019s creator, Gary Gygax), and Halliday\u2019s avatar Anorak, who is partially based on a D&D wizard.\n\nExcalibur\n\nIn order to counteract the force-field-generating power of the Orb of Osuvox, Art3mis utters the \u201cCharm of Making\u201d from John Boorman\u2019s 1981 version of the Arthurian legend.\n\nFast Times at Ridgemont High\n\nWhen Sorrento is trying to prove his geek bona fides to Wade (with the aural aid of an actual geek, of course), he name-drops Amy Heckerling\u2019s popular 1982 coming-of-age teen movie.\n\nView photos Jeff Goldblum as the title character in David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 horror favorite The Fly. (Photo: 20th Century Fox Film Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection) More\n\nThe Fly\n\nWhen discussing Halliday\u2019s love of The Shining, the characters mention that the OASIS founder watched Stanley Kubrick\u2019s classic the same week that he saw David Cronenberg\u2019s 1986 horror classic.\n\nForbidden Planet\n\nThe 1956 sci-fi favorite gets two shout-outs, both in the form of Robbie the Robot. Robbie appears as a toy in Halliday\u2019s childhood room, and as a larger model in Wade\u2019s apartment in the last scene. (Gremlins fans know that the robot also cameos in the Spielberg-produced comedy horror hit.)\n\nFriday the 13th\n\nAs the central boogeyman of the vintage horror franchise, Jason Voorhees has been to hell, outer space, and everywhere in between. Here he heads into the digital realm, partaking in some hack-and-slash on Planet Doom.\n\nGalaga\n\nA poster for Midway\u2019s 1981 coin-op classic is seen at one point in the film.\n\nGod of War\n\nKratos, the brutal Spartan warrior who headlines the God of War video-game series, makes a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-him cameo.\n\nHarley Quinn and the Joker\n\nThe Clown Prince of Crime and his maniacal main squeeze are among the avatars in the nightclub scene. Another DC baddie, Deathstroke, is also in attendance.\n\nView photos The Joker and Harley Quinn are among several DC Comics characters who cameo in Ready Player One. (Photo: Warner Bros.) More\n\nHalo\n\nDuring the final battle on Planet Doom, a squad of Master Chief-resembling Spartan soldiers are seen taking up arms.\n\nHello Kitty\n\nWhen Wade strolls through the OASIS in his Parzival avatar at the beginning of the film, he passes by Sanrio\u2019s popular feline mascot \u2014 who has adorned backpacks and baby clothes since 1974 \u2014 and two of her pals.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk\n\nExplaining why his name is \u201cWade Watts,\u201d our hero says that his geeky dad liked the alliterative characters that graced the pages of Marvel Comics \u2014 characters like Bruce Banner, the alter ego of Marvel\u2019s not-so-jolly green giant.\n\nThe Iron Giant\n\nAech builds the Iron Giant of Brad Bird\u2019s beloved 1999 animated film, and then pilots the robot into the final battle to face off against another metal titan: Mechagodzilla.\n\nView photos The Iron Giant plays a key role in Ready Player One. (Photo: Warner Bros.) More\n\nJohn Hughes\n\nThe official poet laureate of \u201980s teen cinema, Hughes is used as a handy brainteaser when Wade tries to suss out Sorrento\u2019s geek knowledge. Both the 1984 favorite The Breakfast Club and 1986\u2019s Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off are called out in this scene. Later on, the poster for Hughes\u2019s 1985 film Weird Science can be briefly glimpsed in Halliday\u2019s childhood bedroom.\n\nJoust\n\nDebuting in arcades in 1982 (and currently available in smaller, home-friendly versions) this John Newcomer-designed game gave the medieval challenge a futuristic twist by seating lance-carrying knights on flying ostriches. Playing Joust is the first test Wade must pass in Cline\u2019s novel, but in Spielberg\u2019s film it appears via a poster on Halliday\u2019s bedroom wall and the game\u2019s ostriches serve as mounts in the massive climactic battle.\n\n\u201cJump\u201d\n\nVan Halen\u2019s synth-driven monster single off the band\u2019s blockbuster 1984 album sets the tone for the film, serving as the lead song on a soundtrack laden with earworms from the 1980s and beyond. Several of the tunes are used for on-the-nose moments in the movie, including Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cStand on It\u201d (the flip side to \u201cGlory Days\u201d was also featured on the Ruthless People soundtrack), Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World,\u201d Prince\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Be Your Lover,\u201d Blondie\u2019s \u201cOne Way or Another,\u201d New Order\u2019s \u201cBlue Monday,\u201d and Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d (which sets up the climactic battle).\n\nJurassic Park\n\nSpielberg nods at his own 1993 blockbuster \u2014 which became the gold standard for CGI and dinosaur movies \u2014 in Ready Player One\u2018s introductory car race sequence, which features a rampaging T. rex.\n\n\n\nKing Kong\n\nAs if a Tyrannosaurus weren\u2019t enough of an obstacle during that car race, Wade also has to cope with the super-size star of one of the original creature features, 1933\u2019s King Kong. The giant ape has lived many lives since then, including as the final obstacle preventing OASIS racers from the finish line.\n\nView photos The Glaive from Krull is used in Ready Player One. (Photo: Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection) More\n\nKrull\n\nIn order to infiltrate the fortress on Planet Doom, Wade\u2019s small army first has to go through digital mercenary, i-R0k (voiced by T.J. Miller). To do that, one of his allies uses the flying five-pointed weapon known as the Glaive from this 1983 cult classic starring Ken Marshall as an intergalactic prince who has to rescue his lady love.\n\nLadyhawke\n\nA poster for Richard Donner\u2019s 1985 fantasy film starring Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer, and Michelle Pfeiffer is visible on Halliday\u2019s bedroom wall.\n\nLast Action Hero\n\nDuring the car race sequence, eagle-eyed viewers will spot a movie marquee emblazoned with \u201cSchwarzengger in Jack Slater III.\u201d Slater is the hero that Arnold Schwarzenegger played in 1993\u2019s underrated action movie spoof Last Action Hero, co-conceived 25 years ago by Ready Player One scribe Zak Penn.\n\nWatch: Zak Penn reveals his Ready Player One references:\n\n\n\nLittleBigPlanet\n\nDuring the final battle, a number of avatars from this popular PlayStation video game series are recognizable.\n\nLooney Tunes\n\nDuring our initial tour of the OASIS, everyone\u2019s favorite alien, Marvin the Martian, walks out of an entry point.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe film\u2019s third act takes place at Anorak\u2019s castle on Planet Doom, a setting based on Tolkien\u2019s Mount Doom. And Halliday\u2019s avatar Anorak is essentially Gandalf the Grey reimagined in the vein of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nMad Max\n\nThe Interceptor, that modified Ford Falcon steered by Max Rockatansky in the 1979 original, makes an appearance in the opening race scene. We also catch a glimpse of the movie poster in Wade\u2019s bedroom.\n\nMadballs\n\nThe weirdly popular \u201980s toy that combined squishy orbs with crazy faces pops up in the movie and is also hidden in the poster, as the official Madballs Instagram gleefully pointed out:\n\nMagic 8-Ball\n\nThe question-answering novelty toy, which was originally created in the 1950s, is part of Ogden Morrow\u2019s bag of tricks.\n\nMasters of the Universe\n\nWade apparently carried his He-Manwiches to school in a He-Man lunchbox, judging from its appearance in his hideout in the Stacks.\n\nMechagodzilla\n\nGodzilla\u2019s alien-spawned robotic adversary, introduced in 1974\u2019s Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, is Sorrento\u2019s war machine of choice, going up against Aech\u2019s Iron Giant in the final battle.\n\nMinecraft\n\nThe beloved building game gets a shout-out in the film\u2019s opening introduction to the sprawling worlds within OASIS.\n\nMobile Suit Gundam\n\nThe influential 1979 Japanese anime series featured the sword-wielding giant robot RX-78-2 Gundam, the robot of choice for Wade\u2019s ally Daitu in the battle against Sorrento\u2019s Mechagodzilla.\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nWade uses the OASIS version of the sacred relic known as the Holy Hand Grenade in the final battle on Planet Doom, taking out a platoon of baddies. Coconuts not included.\n\nMortal Kombat\n\nArt3mis disguises herself as a Kombatant at one point, and you\u2019ll also spot a pair of dragons guarding Halliday\u2019s Easter egg, as well as statues of fighters Raiden, Sub-Zero, and Scorpion in the background.\n\nNightmare on Elm Street\n\nFreddy Krueger leaves our dreams to invade the virtual world of OASIS. He can be seen in Planet Doom\u2019s opening battle.\n\nView photos Freddy Krueger leaps into action. (Photo:Warner Bros.) More\n\nOverwatch\n\nThe character Tracer from the hit 2016 video game appears as an avatar in the Planet Doom battle.\n\nPac-Man\n\nHalliday has a poster of Namco\u2019s groundbreaking 1980 arcade game up in his room, while Art3mis/Samantha has stickers for Ms. Pac-Man on her bike and some Pac-Man cherries on her OASIS visor.\n\nPCU\n\nScreenwriter Zak Penn told us he snuck in a deep-cut reference to 1994 frat-house comedy PCU. In the film, Jeremy Piven tells Jon Favreau \u201cdon\u2019t be that guy\u201d who wears a band T-shirt to the band\u2019s concert. In the film, Aech uses the line on Parzival, warning him not to wear his Buckaroo Banzai getup on a date with Art3mis.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nOne of the rare instances of Spielberg self-referencing in RP1: Halliday has an Indy poster in his room.\n\nRobocop\n\nDetroit\u2019s protector and server can be seen walking out of an OASIS entry point early in the film.\n\nRubik\u2019s Cube\n\nIn the film it\u2019s a powerful relic called the \u201cZemeckis Cube,\u201d after Spielberg\u2019s Back to the Future buddy Robert Zemeckis, and it can turn the clock back 60 seconds.\n\nRush\n\nWhile Cline\u2019s book features some pivotal plot points focused on the Canadian prog-rockers, the movie\u2019s sole reference is a poster for the band\u2019s 1976 album 2112 on Halliday\u2019s wall. (The group\u2019s signature hit, \u201cTom Sawyer,\u201d was featured on the film\u2019s Comic-Con trailer, although it\u2019s not on the official soundtrack.)\n\nRun-DMC\n\nWe\u2019re 99 percent positive we spotted one avatar in the OASIS dressed like one of the members of this seminal \u201980s rap (and sometimes rock) group.\n\nSaturday Night Fever\n\nParzival is clearly busting some Tony Manero disco moves when he turns up at the Distracted Globe nightclub to the strains of the Bee Gees\u2019 \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d\n\nSay Anything\n\nThe 1989 Cameron Crowe rom-com is mentioned as one of the film\u2019s Halliday watched the same week as The Shining (as Parzival and Art3mis look for clues to the second challenge). But more prominently we see Z channeling his inner Lloyd Dobler by striking the iconic John Cusack boom box pose in the final battle.\n\nView photos Wade strikes a familiar pose in rallying his troops to the fight. (Photo: Warner Bros.) More\n\nThe Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\n\nSpielberg has long professed admiration for special-effects trailblazer Ray Harryhausen, whose legendary creations included the stop-motion Cyclops from the 1958 fantasy adventure film. The horned giant appears twice in RP1, first at an OASIS entry point early in the film and then again in the final battle on Planet Doom.\n\nThe Shining\n\nArguably Ready Player One\u2019s strongest sequence is the High Five\u2019s search for second key in the faithfully re-created Overlook Hotel from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1980 adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel. While the film has been celebrated by critics and fans, King believes it to be one of the worst adaptations of his work.\n\nView photos The Overlook Hotel is the setting for one of the most memorable sequences in Ready Player One. (Photo: Mary Evans/Warner Bros./Ronald Grant/Everett Collection) More\n\nSilent Running\n\nThe Valley Forge spaceship from the 1972 environmentally themed sci-fi film starring Bruce Dern was one of the many model ships seen in Aech\u2019s workshop, complete with those greenhouse domes.\n\nSimon\n\nHalliday wears a button featuring Milton Bradley\u2019s classic multicolored follow-the-leader electronic game, launched in 1979.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nIntroduced in the eponymous 1991 Sega Genesis game, Sonic was the first 16-bit rival to Nintendo\u2019s Mario. The blue-furred speedster has since appeared in a host of video games, and his avatar pops up in the OASIS.\n\nSpace Invaders\n\nFeatured on at least two T-shirts in the film \u2014 one worn by the older Halliday and one by his younger self \u2014 Tomohiro Nishikado\u2019s Space Invaders was one of the first and most successful arcade games when it was released in 1978.\n\nSpaceballs\n\nLone Starr and Barf\u2019s Winnebago spaceship, the Eagle 5, from Mel Brooks\u2019s 1987 Star Wars parody is among the litany of ships seen in Aech\u2019s workshop.\n\nSpeed Racer\n\nThe Mach 5, the signature car from the \u201960s anime series, is featured among the numerous vehicles in the film\u2019s opening race.\n\nStar Trek\n\nGene Roddenberry\u2019s classic sci-fi franchise plays a large role in the film, most notably in Halliday\u2019s homage to Spock\u2019s \u201cfuneral\u201d from The Wrath of Khan\u00ad, complete with Starfleet logo wreaths. A poster for Star Trek: The Motion Picture is also featured in Halliday\u2019s childhood bedroom, and at the end of the film a Klingon Bat\u2019leth \u2014 a curved, horned blade \u2014 is seen perched on the window of Wade and Samantha\u2019s apartment.\n\nStar Wars\n\nWhile featured heavily in the original novel, George Lucas\u2019s beloved franchise has only a few brief mentions in the film due to \u2026 well, being currently owned be a competing studio. The first reference comes after Wade wins the first key when Halliday\u2019s avatar Anorak refers to Parzival as a padawan \u2014 the term for a Jedi apprentice first heard in The Phantom Menace. The Millennium Falcon is later referenced by Sorrento (played by the erstwhile Director Krennic, Ben Mendelson). A Revenge of the Jedi poster is featured outside the theater where The Shining is playing. (For the n00bs: Revenge was the original title of Return of the Jedi before Lucas decided Jedi don\u2019t believe in revenge.) Finally, Spielberg snuck in some Stormtroopers and R2-D2, the diminutive droid being one of the filmmaker\u2019s favorite Easter eggs.\n\nWatch: Spielberg explains how he got his Star Wars references into Ready Player One:\n\n\n\nStreet Fighter II\n\nThe 1991 Capcom button mashing game gets a lot of love in the OASIS. Ryu, Blanka, and Chun-Li are among the many avatars seen dancing and fighting and fawning over Parzival. Wade himself gets to use Ryu and Ken\u2019s \u201cHadouken!\u201d attack at the end of the movie.\n\nSupergirl\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the Injustice video game series, which features DC Comics heroes facing off against their fascist counterparts from an alternate reality, then you\u2019re going to love Ready Player One. Injustice versions of the comic heroes are scattered throughout the film, with Supergirl and the Joker featured particularly prominently.\n\nSuperman\n\nThere are no Superman sightings per se, but his shadow looms large in the OASIS. Art3mis gives Parzival Clark Kent glasses to hide his identity without changing his appearance, and we later learn that Halliday\u2019s favorite quote is from Richard Donner\u2019s 1978 Superman. And there are some here at Yahoo Entertainment who are convinced that Sorrento\u2019s avatar is inspired by Superman, because there are very few characters who can sport an S-shaped spit curl that strong.\n\nView photos Sorrento\u2019s avatar sports a familiar-looking curl in Ready Player One. (Image: Warner Bros.) More\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nDuring the climactic battle on Planet Doom, we see four kids \u201cfighting\u201d in the streets before revealing their avatars to be the 2014 cinematic versions of the world\u2019s most fearsome fighting team, those green heroes in a half-shell: Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael, who first appeared in 1984.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day\n\nJust before Aech\u2019s Iron Giant avatar sinks into the molten lava on Planet Doom, she gives a Parzival a thumbs-up reminiscent of the T-800\u2019s goodbye to John Connor in James Cameron\u2019s 1991 sequel. Fortunately, like the Arnie\u2019s T-800, Aech will be back.\n\nThundercats\n\nLike many kids in the \u201980s, Parzival wears a belt featuring the Eye of Thundera from the 1985-89 animated series. Unfortunately, he never gets the chance to let the Thundercats loose (doot doot).\n\nTomb Raider\n\nLara Croft first made waves in the video-game universe in 1996, and since then she\u2019s appeared in 18 games and a trio of feature films. In a world as video-game-centric as the OASIS, it should come as little surprise that someone would be using her avatar in 2045.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n\u201cOpen the pod bay doors, HAL!\u201d someone certainly shouted when they saw the Discovery One\u2019s EVA pod in Aech\u2019s workshop.\n\nUncharted\n\nNathan Drake, the hero from PlayStation\u2019s Indiana Jones-esque adventure game series, has a blink-and-you-miss-it cameo as an OASIS avatar\n\nUltrabots\n\nIf you look closely during the Planet Doom battle, you can see one the scorpions from this 1993 PC game using its stingers on the IOI army.\n\nWar of the Worlds\n\nSorrento and I-R0k\u2019s first meeting on Planet Doom is held next to a downed Martian ship, but not the one from Spielberg\u2019s 2005 adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel. Instead, the green flying wing design comes from the 1953 Bryon Haskin classic.\n\nWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\n\nErnie Cline has described his book and movie thusly: \u201cIf Willy Wonka was a video-game designer instead of a candy maker and he held his golden ticket contest inside the world\u2019s greatest video game \u2014 that\u2019s the essence of what the story is.\u201d Indeed,
