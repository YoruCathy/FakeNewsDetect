This alone would have prevented last year's fiasco. Beatty and Dunaway were given the wrong envelope. Rather than holding the Best Picture envelope, they carried a copy of the Best Actress card, which had gone to La La Land's Emma Stone in the previous category.\n\nA third accounting partner who will sit with Oscar producers in the show's control room has been added to the event. That person's job is to memorize the name of every award winner in the event of another erroneous announcement. That will cut down on the time it takes to fix any possible confusion. (It was several chaotic minutes before the mishap last year was resolved.) Additionally, last year's accountants, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz, have been replaced by Kimberly Bourdon and Rick Rosas, who had handled the Oscars envelopes for 14 years.\n\nAll three PwC accountants will attend the Oscars rehearsals to practice what to do in case anything goes wrong this year.\n\nAnd, in what is perhaps the most significant change \u2014 one the academy instituted after the event last year \u2014 PwC partners won't be allowed to use cellphones or any social media during the show.\n\nJust before handing Beatty the wrong envelope, Cullinan, tweeted out a picture of Stone, holding her golden statue backstage.\n\n\"Our singular focus will be on the show and delivering the correct envelopes,\" Ryan said to the Associated Press.\n\nThe nominations for the 90th Academy Awards were announced Tuesday morning. The awards ceremony will be broadcast March 4.", "images": ["https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/24/undefined_sq-63f9f4b46bb9031d67f9785b66818f4befbab8bc.jpg?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-dark.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/23/ap_17058143882439-bc3afbfb0b8ad9e6565be654034af26d8ba40267-s1100-c15.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/19/gettyimages-645733726_sq-7b277ba401019e6fc2db988da07917c56bc0bddb-s100-c15.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/23/ap_17058143882439_wide-ede1abcbd40788c04dc39e0e6a57e9d9b3b31c9e.jpg?s=1400", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesun_sq-4a03b35e7e5adfa446aec374523a578d54dc9bf5-s100-c85.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/morning-edition.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/up-first.jpg?version=2", "https://media.npr.org/branding/sections/thetwo-way/branding_icon-aec8943f7fba654246d504d81ae2999f30b3106f.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/17/coronavirus_daily_final__sq-2aca96317281db7f8671e5bf24e68fb77b66bbed.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/02/21/invisibiliapodcasttile-3000x3000_sq-3cea16f264a5ecd812496bd930d38c4f54102d6e.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-light.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/09/trh_podcast-tile_sq-c05fb259465d433a5cf8a21248b8fa209a6b7690.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/all-things-considered.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/11/21/vanessaromo_sq-c63578a4869215f8a361fbab54b5f11fd7b81130-s100-c85.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesat_sq-cbde87a2fa31b01047441e6f34d2769b0287bcd4-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-logo.svg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/fresh-air.png"], "top_img": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/23/ap_17058143882439_wide-ede1abcbd40788c04dc39e0e6a57e9d9b3b31c9e.jpg?s=1400", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/23/579973772/oscar-awards-debut-new-rules-to-avoid-another-envelope-mix-up", "title": "Oscars Debut New Rules To Avoid Another Envelope Mix-Up", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "1VqzbDm4ukeFVHOoq5LjIKA2fVKZD-EYv8cXZhKXSfU", "robots": "noarchive,index,follow", "Rating": "General", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "date": "2018-01-23", "description": "Last year's historic Best Picture debacle prompted the accounting firm responsible for the security of envelopes to come up with new fail-safes.
