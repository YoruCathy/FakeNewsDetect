Everyone, that is, except for John Oliver. The late-night host sent a very different message than we\u2019re used to hearing while appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which shed a light on some of the reasons why people might not want to get too excited.\n\nOliver claimed he wouldn\u2019t blame Markle if she had changed her mind about marrying the prince \u2014 here\u2019s why.\n\nOliver had warned Markle that there was still time to run\n\nOliver isn\u2019t a big fan of England\u2019s royal hierarchy. | Mark Davis/Getty Images Oliver isn\u2019t a big fan of England\u2019s royal hierarchy. | Mark Davis/Getty Images\n\nColbert brought up the topic of the royal wedding during the interview, assuming Oliver might be excited. He argued, \u201cYou\u2019re English, you must be really excited about the royal wedding,\u201d to which Oliver responded with a hard \u201cno.\u201d\n\nColbert asked if Oliver had any tips for Harry, considering Oliver\u2019s similarity with the royal couple. \u201cHe\u2019s a Brit, he\u2019s marrying an American girl,\u201d Colbert argued. \u201cYou\u2019re British, you married an American woman.\u201d\n\nOliver didn\u2019t have any advice for Harry, but he did issue a harsh warning to Markle: Run.\n\nNext: He\u2019s not exactly the royal family\u2019s biggest fan.\n\nThe royal family could cause her \u2018emotional complications\u2019\n\nHopefully, Markle won\u2019t experience a heartbreak on her wedding day the way her Suits character did. | USA Hopefully, Markle won\u2019t experience a heartbreak on her wedding day the way her Suits character did. | USA\n\nOliver argued his point about why he \u201cwould not blame her if she pulled out of this at the last minute.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to have just seen the pilot episode of The Crown to get a basic sense of she might be marrying into a family that could cause her some emotional complications.\u201d\n\nNext: This is where his opinions get pretty harsh.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be weird for her\u2019\n\nWill it be strange for Markle to try and fit in with the young royals? | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Will it be strange for Markle to try and fit in with the young royals? | Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nColbert tried to defend the younger generation of royals by calling them nice, but Oliver wasn\u2019t completely keen on agreeing. \u201cI mean, they are an emotionally stunted group of fundamentally flawed people doing a very silly pseudo job \u2014 that\u2019s what she\u2019s marrying into,\u201d he criticized.\n\n\u201cSo, I hope she likes it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be weird for her.\u201d\n\nNext: He made this odd comparison to the royal family.\n\nOliver compared royal weddings to fireworks\n\nRoyal weddings certainly are known for their fanfare. | Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images Royal weddings certainly are known for their fanfare. | Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOliver voiced his assumption that he probably wouldn\u2019t be welcomed into the royal family. Considering his voiced opinions, he likely wouldn\u2019t end up on the guest list to the wedding, either.\n\nOliver did admit, \u201cI like royal weddings,\u201d but he added, \u201cI also like fireworks. You know, it\u2019s a spectacle. It\u2019s something nice to look at.\u201d Not exactly the most heartfelt compliment to offer, but we\u2019ll take it.\n\nNext: We can see where Oliver may be coming from.\n\nMarkle does have to conform to some crazy rules\n\nThere are plenty of changes on the horizon for the soon-to-be royal. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images There are plenty of changes on the horizon for the soon-to-be royal. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nGranted, we can definitely see where Oliver is coming from. The royal family has to conform to some crazy rules, whether or not they\u2019re in the public eye.\n\nFor example, Markle will have to get used to remaining neutral about politics, avoiding shellfish at all costs, and giving any gifts she receives to the queen for approval.\n\nNext: She hasn\u2019t been scared away just yet.\n\nShe seems to be fitting in already\n\nMarkle appears comfortable in the limelight. | Jeremy Selwyn \u2013 WPA Pool/Getty Images Markle appears comfortable in the limelight. | Jeremy Selwyn \u2013 WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nBased on what we\u2019ve seen so far, Markle is already settling into her new royal life. She\u2019s reportedly already good friends with Kate Middleton, who similarly had to undergo the transition from commoner to royal.\n\nConsidering Markle\u2019s fame prior to becoming engaged to Harry, she\u2019s had plenty of experience being in the public eye. At as she\u2019s begun to attend more and more royal events, she\u2019s proven to be completely comfortable with being photographed. So comfortable, in fact, that she stares straight into the camera \u2014 which even Middleton doesn\u2019t do.\n\nNext: She\u2019s already made these major life changes.\n\nShe knew what she was getting herself into\n\nWe think Markle is prepared. | We think Markle is prepared. | Kensington Royal via Instagram\n\nMarkle had to undergo some serious etiquette training, and she learned some ground rules from her hubby. She quit her career as an actress and moved to England to immerse herself in her new royal life in the months prior to the wedding.\n\nEven if Oliver doesn\u2019t think Markle\u2019s made the right choice, it seems like she knew exactly what she has gotten herself into.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-smiling-as-she-holds-a-bouquet.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Oliver.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Oliver.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-engagement-photo-e1514400474670.png?x62514", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kate-Middleton-and-Meaghan-Markle.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/meghan-markle-suits-rachel-wedding-dress.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-157652210.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1.jpg?x62514"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/John-Oliver.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Leary"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-1-surprising-reason-john-oliver-wouldnt-blame-meghan-markle-for-calling-off-the-royal-wedding.html/", "title": "The 1 Surprising Reason John Oliver Wouldn\u2019t Blame Meghan Markle for Calling Off the Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-1-surprising-reason-john-oliver-wouldnt-blame-meghan-markle-for-calling-off-the-royal-wedding.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "John Oliver may be the only person who wasn't excited for the royal wedding.
