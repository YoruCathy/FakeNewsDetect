The whole world watched with baited breath to see what Princess Diana wore down the aisle in 1981 and the silk and taffeta dress was as of the time as a dress could be.

The gown is said to have weighed 50lb with a 13ft train.\n\nThe Platinum Dress\n\nCreated by Mauro Adami in 2008, this \u00a3240,000 luxurious wedding dress is made up of nearly 132ft of platinum-coloured fabric and sewn with silk and platinum thread. You wouldn\u2019t want to spill your Champagne down that one.\n\nThe modern-day fairytale dress\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge lived out every little girl\u2019s fantasy when she transformed from one of us to bona-fide royalty in the royal wedding to end all celebrations.\n\nKate\u2019s transformation wasn\u2019t complete without a stunning dress and she didn\u2019t disappoint in her bespoke Alexander McQueen gown \u2013 coming in at an eye-watering \u00a3250,000.\n\nThe White Gold Diamond Dress\n\nDesigned by Japanese designer Yumi Katsura \u2013 known as the Missionary of Bridal \u2013 the White Gold Diamond Dress is valued at an unbelievable $8.5 million (\u00a35 million).\n\nBoasting a five-carat gold diamond and 1,000 pearls, this poor dress is yet to find a bride wealthy enough to buy it.\n\nThe world's most expensive dress\n\nTaking the top spot as the world\u2019s most expensive is a \u00a37.4 million diamond-encrusted creation designed by Martin Katz Jewellers and Renee Strauss.\n\nAdorned with 150 carats worth of diamonds, it was created for a bridal show in 2006.
