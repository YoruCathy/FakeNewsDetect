The first iteration of the network featured many traditional interior designers and gardeners, and leaned less on celebrity style. And while we just as giddy over today's Property Brothers as the next fan, we can't help but pine for the classic shows of HGTV's infancy, too.\n\n1. Room By Room\n\nHGTV\n\nGood ol' Matt Fox and Shari Hiller launched HGTV's very first show with Room by Room, which highlighted easy DIY projects and lots of kitschy touches (case in point: this baseball bathroom). The designing duo (who are not married, if you're curious) still hold the record for the longest-running HGTV show, and today, you can catch up with them and their go-to cornice boards on their blog.\n\n2. Designer's Challenge\n\nHGTV\n\nBefore DIY decorating was trendy, Designer's Challenge had traditionally minded designers compete against each other (very civilly, of course) to win big-budget projects.\n\nAnd yep, that's Chris Harrsion (the host of The Bachelor) in front of those floating circles. His new show might be a bit sexier, but we bet he misses the thrill of a good mood board (a.k.a. the original Pinterest board).\n\nHGTV\n\n3. Gardening By the Yard\n\nHGTV\n\nWe're not sure we've come across a more enthusiastic home gardener than the mustachioed Paul James. After all, it takes a true yardwork devotee to want to waltz with a rake.\n\n4. Decorating Cents\n\nHGTV\n\nOn Joan Steffand's no-nonsense show, you got just $500 to redecorate a room \u2014 and the outcome was often very colorful.\n\n5. Designing For the Sexes\n\nHGTV\n\nOn this classic show, designer Michael Payne helped opinionated couples (and sometimes, their gigantic dogs) meet in the middle on tough decorating choices.\n\n6. Kitty Bartholomew's You're Home\n\nHGTV\n\nA true legend in the TV decorating world, Kitty Bartholomew unabashedly made bold choices in her designs. Though she's been absent from the scene in recent years, a peek at her on-the-market Santa Monica cottage gave fans a glimpse into her home in 2009.\n\nTELL US: What was your favorite show?", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/768x384/landscape-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/768x384/landscape-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Piro", "Senior Web Editor", "Overseeing All Things Home For Goodhousekeeping.Com", "Housebeautiful.Com", "Lauren Swoons Over Midcentury Design", "Employs Tough-Love Approach To Decluttering", "Just Throw It Away", "Ladies ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a33005/classic-hgtv-shows/", "title": "6 Classic HGTV Shows We Wish Would Stage a Comeback", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Good Housekeeping", "title": "6 Classic HGTV Shows We Wish Would Stage a Comeback", "description": "What we wouldn't give for another episode of \"Designer's Challenge.\"", "url": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/a33005/classic-hgtv-shows/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/768x384/landscape-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 119423528138309, "pages": 40241492597}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GOODHOUSEKEEPING", "modified_time": "2018-03-21 05:39:48", "published_time": "2015-06-18 08:50:00", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@goodhousemag", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/768x384/landscape-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "Cyrrih2f3Dh884Dysa4Fuafe2UewzpbR6gnQipgICss", "title": "Classic HGTV Shows - HGTV Shows We Miss", "description": "We wish HGTV would bring back these classic shows.", "keywords": "hgtv, hgtv shows, classic hgtv shows, designer's challenge, room by room, matt and shari, decorating cents, gardening by the yard, kitty bartholomew, tv, vintage hgtv", "auto-publish": "evergreen", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/320x320/square-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life,life,entertainment,HGTV", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-18T20:50:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/768x384/landscape-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/25/320x320/square-1434652210-room-by-room-index.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "6 Classic HGTV Shows We Wish Would Stage a Comeback", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1434588600.0, "source": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com", "summary": ""}
