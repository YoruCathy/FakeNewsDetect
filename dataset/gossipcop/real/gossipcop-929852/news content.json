Rolling Stone reported at the time that Fleetwood Mac had let Buckingham go after a disagreement over the tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0093Words like \u0091fired\u0092 are ugly references as far as I\u0092m concerned,\u0094 drummer and co-founder Mick Fleetwood told the magazine in comments posted on Wednesday, the band\u0092s first remarks about Buckingham since their shocking announcement. \u0093Not to hedge around, but we arrived at the impasse of hitting a brick wall. This was not a happy situation for us in terms of the logistics of a functioning band. To that purpose, we made a decision that we could not go on with him. Majority rules in term of what we need to do as a band and go forward.\u0094\n\n\n\nFleetwood also called Buckingham\u0092s ousting business as usual, the outlet said.\n\n\n\nBuckingham did not respond to Rolling Stone\u0091s multiple requests for comment.\n\n\n\nMick Fleetwood\n\n\n\nDia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\n\n\nLindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks\n\n\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\n\n\nBuckingham joined Fleetwood Mac with then-girlfriend and singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks in 1974. He left the group in 1987 and rejoined the band a decade later.\n\n\n\n\u0093Our relationship has always been volatile,\u0094 she told Rolling Stone about the musician. \u0093We were never married, but we might as well have been. Some couples get divorced after 40 years. They break their kids\u0092 hearts and destroy everyone around them because it\u0092s just hard. This is sad for me, but I want the next 10 years of my life to be really fun and happy. I want to get up every day and dance around my apartment and smile and say, \u0091Thank God for this amazing life.'\u0094\n\n\n\nShe told Rolling Stone that their upcoming tour will feature songs from the entire history of Fleetwood Mac, not just the original Buckingham-Nicks run from 1975 to 1987.\n\n\n\n\u0093We were never able to do that since 1975 because certain people in the band weren\u0092t interested in doing that,\u0094 she said.\n\n\n\n\"kind of weird: a tribute to the dearly departed from a band that can treat its living like trash\" __________________", "images": ["http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/sendtofriend.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/icons/icon1.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/statusicon/post_old.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=14022&dateline=1442240445", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/smilies/confused2.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=1995&dateline=1531371871", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/mode_hybrid.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/mode_threaded.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/reply.gif", "http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/img/assets/logoLedgeRumours.png", "https://image.ibb.co/diDAGx/Untitled.png", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=16592&type=sigpic&dateline=1546214464", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/printer.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/smilies/smile.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/misc/navbits_finallink.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/viewpost.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/mode_linear.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/statusicon/user_offline.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=14048&type=sigpic&dateline=1511005497", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=905&type=sigpic&dateline=1484754551", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=7814&type=sigpic&dateline=1431790821", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=14048&dateline=1490567531", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=7355&dateline=1391269144", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/collapse_thead.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/vintage/e.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=16592&dateline=1546214715", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/cron.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&rand=1587232243", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=7355&type=sigpic&dateline=1524957829", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/buttons/quote.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/misc/navbits_start.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/images/smilies/lol2.gif", "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=1307&dateline=1549659448"], "top_img": "http://ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/image.php?s=7e4d50dbc8454d36c4628dd8583476cd&u=14048&type=sigpic&dateline=1511005497", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Lindsey was fired.
