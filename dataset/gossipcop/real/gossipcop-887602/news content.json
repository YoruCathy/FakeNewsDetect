The \"Fixer Upper\" couple is returning to TV!\n\nAfter taking a year off after their fifth season of the show, during which they had their fifth child, the couple decided it was time to get back to work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming back to television,\u201d Gaines said, to cheers from the studio audience. \u201cWe're actually going to have a network, and I think we're going to really carve it out in a way that makes sense to us and our family.\u201d\n\nChip Gaines explained that the pair has partnered with David Zaslav, the president of cable television giant Discovery Inc. to launch a new network.\n\nDiscovery bought the parent company of HGTV and Food Network earlier this year.\n\nChip Gaines said that much of the filming will be done in their hometown of Waco, Texas, where \"Fixer Upper\" was shot.\n\n\u201cIt's going to be filmed a lot in Waco, Texas, so we don't have to travel a whole lot,\u201d Chip Gaines said on Fallon\u2019s show. \u201cSo with all things being equal, we could not be more excited.\u201d\n\n\"We are coming back to television. You're going to see the kids grow up,\" Gaines said. \"We're excited to be back.\"\n\nDetails of the deal are still being worked out. Industry insiders suggest that the couple's lifestyle brand, Magnolia, may be part of the new network's name.\n\nWatch the announcement in the player below.", "images": ["https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e97c417/2147483647/strip/true/crop/600x200+0+0/resize/400x133!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fa9%2F3c%2F9f6b133f451482c4fb7d56b6f94c%2Fwptv-geographic-locator-600x200.png", "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1bdaebf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/675x675+113+0/resize/300x300!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediaassets.wptv.com%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F12%2F21%2Fwptv-logo-black-on-background_1482340212631_51863947_ver1.0.jpg", "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8baa1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "https://assets.scrippsdigital.com/cms/images/color_schemes/wptv/square--144.png", "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0fcf570/2147483647/strip/true/crop/480x360+0+0/resize/480x360!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F9b%2Fa5%2F4942c407473c825bb0b7a672104c%2Fwptv-am-news-480x360.jpg", "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/148bb5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x360+0+60/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "https://assets.scrippsdigital.com/cms/images/logo-scripps.png"], "top_img": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8baa1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wptv.com/entertainment/-fixer-upper-stars-chip-and-joanna-gaines-returning-to-tv-with-a-new-discovery-network", "title": "'Fixer Upper' stars Chip and Joanna Gaines returning to TV with a new Discovery network", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The pair announced the news on 'The Tonight Show' on Friday night.", "keywords": "Homepage Showcase,Entertainment,News", "brightspot.contentId": "00000167-2d98-dd86-a9f7-3dfba5770000", "og": {"title": "Chip and Joanna Gaines are returning to TV", "url": "https://www.wptv.com/entertainment/-fixer-upper-stars-chip-and-joanna-gaines-returning-to-tv-with-a-new-discovery-network", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8baa1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8baa1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "secure_url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8baa1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "'Fixer Upper' stars Chip and Joanna Gaines returning to TV with a new Discovery network"}, "description": "The pair announced the news on 'The Tonight Show' on Friday night.", "site_name": "WPTV", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.wptv.com/wptv-webteam", "published_time": "2018-11-12T14:32:19", "modified_time": "2018-11-12T14:32:19", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Homepage Showcase", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The pair announced the news on 'The Tonight Show' on Friday night.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8baa1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharing.wptv.com%2Fsharescnn%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2F1528394504_89164622_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "alt": "'Fixer Upper' stars Chip and Joanna Gaines returning to TV with a new Discovery network"}, "site": "@WPTV", "title": "Chip and Joanna Gaines are returning to TV"}, "fb": {"app_id": 207362756082470, "pages": 54514363383}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "google-site-verification": "VWDe-mmQElRHfQ_hQJkMphjOR244Qa4ze45Af8omOpk"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542004339.0, "source": "https://www.wptv.com", "summary": ""}
