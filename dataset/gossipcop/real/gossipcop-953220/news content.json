That wasn\u2019t working out. I asked the usual suspects: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ryan Phillippe. They all said no.\u201d\n\nThe names were confirmed by Diana Ossana, the film\u2019s producer, who said that they \u201cturned down the project, for various reasons\u201d, and that \u201c[casting] Ennis in particular was the ultimate hurdle\u201d.\n\nLedger eventually played Ennis, an introverted farmhand, opposite Gyllenhaal\u2019s Twist, the more open of the pair, who continue their affair sporadically over 20 years. It was based on a short story by the writer Annie Proulx.\n\nVan Sant worked on the film before Ang Lee took over. It won the best director Oscar, one of three Academy awards the film took home in 2006, although it was controversially beaten to best picture by Paul Haggis\u2019s Crash.\n\nBoth Ledger, who died in 2008, and Gyllenhaal were nominated for best actor, and their work on the film earned them enduring respect and acclaim. The career of neither actor was felt to be remotely impaired by taking on gay roles.\n\nVan Sant was speaking to promote Don\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot, which stars Joaquin Phoenix and is widely perceived to be a return to form, following the disappointing Sea of Trees.\n\nPitt and DiCaprio will co-star for the first time in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s new film about the Charles Manson murders, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which is due for release in 2019.", "images":
