Several had been on the show at completely different times \u2014 like Ballard and Elisa Donovan, who played Morgan, one of Sabrina\u2019s roommates in college.\n\nRichert also shared a video of the crowd\u2019s applause as the reunited actors took the stage together for the first time in 20 years.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \u2018Riverdale\u2019 Spinoff Focused On Sabrina The Teenage Witch In Development At The CW\n\nDuring the panel, the cast confirmed they had nothing to do with the CW\u2019s upcoming reimagining of the series \u2014 which is currently in development \u2014 but they did offer a little insight into what they thought their characters would be up to in 2017. Entertainment Weekly reported that Richert said \u201cSabrina and Harvey would probably be having a 16-year-old at this point.\u201d\n\nHart added that the couple had \u201cprobably started our own, like, Hogwarts. Started our own little witch school, maybe foster some children that are part mortal, part witch, and [teach them] how to navigate that world.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Broderick, who played Sabrina\u2019s Aunt Zelda, said her character was \u201cdriving an Uber in the other realm,\u201d while Rhea imagined a more \u201cpathetic\u201d future for Aunt Hilda. \u201cI think it\u2019s so sad, I think I probably live with Salem alone somewhere and pine for Drell.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Beth Broderick (from left) Melissa Joan Hart and Caroline Rhea ABC/Getty Images\n\nAsked what the future held for the beloved talking feline, Bakay said \u201cSalem is still consigned to being a cat for trying to take over the world. I think he\u2019s into Soduku. I think he\u2019s into role-playing, the whole thing.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2F644347-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fmelissa-joan-hart1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fmelissa-joan-hart1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/cast-of-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-reunites-los-angeles/", "title": "Sabrina the Teenage Witch Cast Reunites in Los Angeles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Melissa Joan Hart,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Melissa Joan Hart,News,TV", "description": "On Saturday, the cast of the beloved TV show Sabrina the Teenage Witch\u00a0\u2014 which ran from 1996 to 2003\u00a0\u2014 reunited for a panel at Los Angeles Comic Con", "og": {"title": "Sabrina the Teenage Witch Cast Reunites in Los Angeles", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/cast-of-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-reunites-los-angeles/", "description": "A magical gathering!
