But, [there\u2019s been] a lot of great memories and pride in that time spent as well.\u201d\n\nSarah Jessica starred on the show alongside her on-screen pals Cynthia Nixon, who played Miranda Hobbes, Kristin Davis, who played Charlotte York Goldenblatt, and Kim Cattrall, who starred as Samantha Jones.\n\nThe famous foursome also starred in two spin-off movies for the franchise in 2008 and 2010, and were reportedly expected to get together for a third movie before plans were scrapped.\n\nIt was reported at the time that the movie had been cancelled because of \u201cdiva demands\u201d from Kim Cattrall, and after Sarah Jessica said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the production\u2019s cancellation, a feud was sparked between the pair.\n\nHowever recently, Sarah Jessica insisted their differences are not down to a \u201ccatfight\u201d, as she has \u201cnever uttered an unkind, unsupportive, unfriendly word\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201c[Cynthia, Kristin, and I] have shared our disappointment that we\u2019re not making that movie, not just on our behalf but our crew, but also just the people that have been vocal about wanting to see it. But we still live in a free country where people get to make choices, and sometimes the answer is \u2018no,\u2019 and the only way to respond for me is to respect that. But, no, there is no catfight, there never has been a catfight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never fought with someone publicly in my life, nor would I. And I spent time with all of the women on the set. People need to recall that it wasn\u2019t just two women on the set fighting, because that just never happened. We are enormously proud of what we got to do \u2026 We spent 10, 12 years of our life doing something that I really loved and I feel privileged to be part of and I don\u2019t want this to eclipse it or change its experience for that audience that was so good to us for so long.\u201d\n\n(Visited 30 times, 1 visits today)\n\n1 SHARES Share Tweet", "images": ["https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/cfl.png", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2012/04/mt-kilimanjaro-19th-floor_small.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/Image7-Lifestyle.png", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/Official-favicon-300x300.png", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/08/bill-kasanda-250x250.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2015/08/toilet.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=KmkRm1aMp4Z3Y8", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2018/06/sarah-jessica-parker.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/Image1-Grace.png", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/05/1024857eb05f2598ae426d46a93a0a97-1-2-250x250.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2015/03/xib813lj.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/Image7-Vin1.png", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2018/06/02704cf06ef08ae8387de06e5c10456dedcc62ee.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/Image3-Ann.png", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2018/06/minaj.jpg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/02/lifestyle-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2018/06/sarah-jessica-parker.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Capital Lifestyle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/2018/06/14/sarah-jessica-parker-reflects-on-sex-and-the-citys-20th-anniversary/", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker reflects on Sex and the City\u2019s 20th anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker reflects on Sex and the City\u2019s 20th anniversary", "description": "The 53-year-old actress starred in the sitcom as Carrie Bradshaw for six years during its run from 1998 to 2004, and has said it's \"hard to imagine\" that the show is still a big hit", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2018/06/sarah-jessica-parker.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 650}, "url": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/2018/06/14/sarah-jessica-parker-reflects-on-sex-and-the-citys-20th-anniversary/", "site_name": "Capital Lifestyle", "updated_time": "2018-06-14T09:22:58+03:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/capitalfmkenya/", "published_time": "2018-06-14T09:21:43+03:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-14T09:22:58+03:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123861527650404, "pages": 178342827608}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker reflects on Sex and the City\u2019s 20th anniversary", "description": "The 53-year-old actress starred in the sitcom as Carrie Bradshaw for six years during its run from 1998 to 2004, and has said it's \"hard to imagine\" that the show is still a big hit", "image": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2018/06/sarah-jessica-parker.jpg", "site": "@CFMLifestyle"}, "description": "The 53-year-old actress starred in the sitcom as Carrie Bradshaw for six years during its run from 1998 to 2004, and has said it's \"hard to imagine\" that A Kenyan lifestyle platform for digital storytelling.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/files/2019/03/favikon-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528905600.0, "source": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke", "summary": ""}
