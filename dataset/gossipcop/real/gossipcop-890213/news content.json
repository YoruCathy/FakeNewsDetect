When Amy Robach brought up Trump Jr.\u2019s string of tweets calling Kimmel out for his silence, the comedian said, \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot, let\u2019s just start with that. This is an imbecile whose job seems to be tweeting, as far as I can tell. With that said, I do admire that he\u2019s very loyal to his father.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the Harvey Weinstein thing, people like these false equivalences of, that somehow is equivalent to what happened is Las Vegas,\u201d Kimmel added. \u201cI mean, Harvey Weinstein is not a friend of mine. I\u2019m not in the movie business. And I\u2019ll add that that story came out, I think, moments before we went to tape on Thursday, and we didn\u2019t have a show on Friday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to drag up \u2014 especially these gun nuts \u2014 are trying to \u2026 take any comedy bit I did out of context and use it as some kind of proof saying that I\u2019m calling myself the moral conscience of America, which I most certainly never did and most certainly never would,\u201d he said.\n\nKimmel, like other late-night hosts, addressed Weinstein the Monday after the New York Times broke the story. On his show, he joked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between Harvey Weinstein and the Pillsbury Doughboy? When the Pillsbury Doughboy offers you a roll, he doesn\u2019t ask you to watch him take a shower for it.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr.\u2019s Twitter attack against Kimmel began with a re-tweeted photo of Weinstein with Obama. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to hear @jimmykimmel\u2019s monologue on this tonight,\u201d the photo was captioned.\n\nSaturday Night Live should be great too. #ImWaiting https://t.co/mTsMtCMREy \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 7, 2017\n\nOn Oct. 7, President Donald Trump tweeted, \u201cLate Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very \u2018unfunny\u2019 & repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?\u201d In response, Kimmel wrote, \u201cExcellent point Mr. President! You should quit that boring job \u2013 I\u2019ll let you have my show ALL to yourself # MAGA,\u201d to which Trump Jr. responded, \u201cThoughts on Harvey Weinstein? #askingforafriend.\u201d\n\nKimmel responded:\n\nYou mean that big story from the failing, liberal, one-sided @nytimes? I think it is disgusting. \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) October 7, 2017\n\nTo which Trump Jr. challenged him:\n\nGreat I look forward to your monologues next week.
