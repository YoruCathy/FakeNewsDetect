Until then, all parties are restrained from gathering additional evidence.\n\nWilliams faces a lawsuit from the family of Barson, 78, who died from injuries sustained in the crash on June 9 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.\n\nAccording to the police collision report obtained by ABC News, Williams was \"at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver].\"\n\nJerome Barson's wife, Linda Barson, was driving the vehicle, a Hyundai Accent, when it hit Williams' Toyota Sequoia. He was taken to a local hospital and died from his injuries two weeks later.\n\nWhile discussing her first-round victory at Wimbledon on Monday, Williams broke down after reporters asked a question about the crash.\n\n\"There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and \u2014 yeah, I'm completely speechless,\" she said, as she held back tears in the tournament's media room.\n\n\"Maybe I should go,\" she said before a tournament representative told her it was OK to leave. She returned later and answered a few more questions.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Barsons' daughter, alleges wrongful death action, and the family is seeking damages in excess of $15,000, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by ABC News.\n\nAfter the collision and Barson's death, Malcolm Cunningham, an attorney for Williams, noted in a statement to ABC News that authorities did not issue her any citations and that \"Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one.\"\n\nPolice are still investigating the crash.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/EPA-venus-williams-jef-170706_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/EPA-venus-williams-jef-170706_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Luchina Fisher", "July", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/venus-williams-files-emergency-court-order-fatal-crash/story?id=48477142", "title": "Venus Williams files emergency court order over fatal crash", "meta_data": {"description": "The tennis star is being sued by the family of a man who died in the crash.", "keywords": "abcnews, venus williams", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
