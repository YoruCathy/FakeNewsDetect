The arrangements are being made,\u201d she told the news outlet.\n\nWhile Tracy and Tyler will not be attending the nuptials, they are planning on traveling to England as part of \u201cGood Morning Britain\u2019s\u201d royal wedding coverage.", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=142", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-937160932.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-937160932.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sasha Savitsky", "Leora Arnowitz", "Fox News", "March"], "canonical_link": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/03/26/meghan-markles-nephew-says-hes-not-invited-to-royal-wedding.html", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s nephew not invited to royal wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
