There are two lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Khloe smiled. \u201cClear as day. I'm pregnant. I am and I felt that I was.\u201d\n\nKhloe then tried to Facetime Tristan in Toronto to tell him, but the connection was so bad he could not see the test she was holding up.\n\nWhen she told him she was pregnant, he said: \u2018Oh my god. Are you kidding or are you serious?\u201d\n\nKhloe then said to the camera: \u201cI said 'I'm serious' and then I started crying. He said 'Are you crying?' and I was like \u2018I\u2019m crying, I don't know what's happening.'\u201d\n\nKUWTK\n\nShe added: \u201cI'm super nervous, but really excited. There's a million different emotions that are going on in my brain. I think I'm in a state of shock. I almost can't believe it, but a good shock.\u201d\n\nLater in the show, we also got to see the rest of the family\u2019s reaction to Khloe\u2019s exciting news as she and Tristan gathered them together to make the announcement.\n\nKUWTK\n\nKhloe\u2019s mum Kris Jenner said: \u201cHearing this news is the most special thing I think anyone can ever tell me. I'm ecstatically surprised. I always thought that maybe Khloe would be one of those women who didn't have kids and I struggled with that.\n\n\u201cIt made me really sad because there was no one that was born to do this more than Khloe.\u201d\n\nKourtney Kardashian, on the other hand, had this to say...\n\nSisters, eh?\n\nFollow Anna on Twitter.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-pregnancy-test-1516105768.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.674xh;0,0.214xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sites/cosmopolitan/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-pregnancy-test-1516105768.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.674xh;0,0.214xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Lewis", "News Editor", "Anna Lewis Is The News Editor At Delish Uk", "Which Means She S Always Either Writing About Food", "Cooking Food Or Eating Food."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a15171582/khloe-kardashian-watch-exact-moment-she-finds-out-about-pregnancy/", "title": "Watch the exact moment Khloe Kardashian found out she was pregnant on KUWTK", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Watch the exact moment Khloe Kardashian found out she was pregnant on KUWTK", "description": "LOOK!
