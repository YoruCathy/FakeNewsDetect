Lest there be any ambiguity, this statement clarifies my intention and feelings.\u201d\n\nWoody Allen addressed the \u201cvery sad\u201d Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal in a new interview where the filmmaker admitted that he was unaware of the severity of the claims against the producer.\n\n\u201cNo one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,\u201d Allen told the BBC. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumors all the time.
