One fan commented on Twitter that they \"cried the whole time,\" while another described the film as one that has \"changed my entire life.\" And it turns out that the cast and crew would agree with fans on the movie's ability to tug at viewers' heartstrings, as there were scenes that didn't leave a dry eye on set.\n\nIn conversation with Gus Kenworthy on ABC 's Nightline , director Greg Berlanti and actor Nick Robinson (AKA Simon) revealed one moment in particular that seemed to resonate with almost everyone. The scene in question took place between Simon and his mother, Emily, portrayed by Jennifer Garner. Simon had already come out to his family, but it was the very first time that he and Emily had sat down and discussed his sexual identity. \"You get to exhale now, Simon,\" she says in the scene, adding: \"You get to be more you than you've been in a very long time.\" She goes on to tell him that he deserves everything he wants.\n\nWhile talking with Gus, Nick explained that he burst into tears while filming the scene, explaining: \"I started crying because those words are kind of universal. The message and the weight that those [words] carry, regardless of your orientation, or who you are...just hearing those words is really powerful.\"\n\nGreg explained that the scene was important to him, too, and the particular exchange between Emily and Simon was purposeful. \"After I came out, there were two things that I really wanted to hear,\" the director explained. \"One was when someone said to me, 'I still love you.' And the other was that 'You deserve love.'\" But it wasn't until he saw the whole cast and crew get emotional that he realized these sentiments resonated with a lot of people. \"It was in that moment I think we all kind of realized, this is a much more universal message than we thought.\"\n\nRelated: Love, Simon Star Keiynan Lonsdale Has Some Important Advice for Those Still in the Closet\n\nCheck This Out:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432im_/https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aad3db77644ea61b54a1c91/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/FB.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432im_/https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aad3d7a7644ea61b54a1c8f/3:2/w_292/MCDLOSI_EC024.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432im_/https://www.teenvogue.com/images/author_default.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432im_/https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aad3db77644ea61b54a1c91/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["De Elizabeth"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/nick-robinson-love-simon-scene-that-made-him-cry", "title": "Nick Robinson Explains the \"Love, Simon\" Scene That Made Him Cry", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "De Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2018", "description": "Find out what Nick Robinson said about the \"Love, Simon\" scene that made him cry.", "keywords": "nick robinson,love simon,gus kenworthy", "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311, "admins": 108943}, "og": {"site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Nick Robinson Told Gus Kenworthy About the \"Love, Simon\" Scene That Made Him Sob", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/nick-robinson-love-simon-scene-that-made-him-cry", "description": "\"Just hearing those words is really powerful.\"", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180318183432im_/https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aad3db77644ea61b54a1c91/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/FB.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@teenvogue", "title": "Nick Robinson Told Gus Kenworthy About the \"Love, Simon\" Scene That Made Him Sob", "description": "\"Just hearing those words is really powerful.\"", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aad3db77644ea61b54a1c91/3:2/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/FB.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "domain": "teenvogue.com"}, "version": "5.0.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
