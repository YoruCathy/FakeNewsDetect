She was later paid A$180,000 in interest.\n\nHowever the size of the payout, Australia's largest for a defamation case, was reduced significantly on appeal.\n\nAhead of the appeal case - which Wilson did not attend in person - the actress was keen to point out that the court was not reconsidering whether she had won her case, but merely the amount paid out.\n\nThe Victorian Court of Appeal ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on film roles.\n\nThe actress wrote on Twitter at the time: \"That's now $4 million less going to less fortunate Australians and leaves a billionaire corporation, proven guilty of malicious defamation, being able to get away with their seriously harmful acts for a very low pay day.\"\n\nThe size of the original payout also generated discussion in Australia over whether it could stifle future journalism in the public interest.", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/138A/production/_102220050_f36fd428-b600-4205-9558-4b7dcac3197e.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/138A/production/_102220050_f36fd428-b600-4205-9558-4b7dcac3197e.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=world::australia::news.world.australia.story.44625076.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:dbed64ee-cc1e-f242-9ee7-5b40eddd25d3]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS]"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/138A/production/_102220050_f36fd428-b600-4205-9558-4b7dcac3197e.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-44625076", "title": "Rebel Wilson ordered to repay millions in defamation case", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Bauer Media successfully appealed against the size of a record Australian payout for defamation.", "x-country": "hk", "x-audience": "Asia", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Asia", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 123366276, "og": {"title": "Rebel Wilson must repay defamation win", "type": "article", "description": "Bauer Media successfully appealed against the size of a record Australian payout for defamation.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-44625076", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/138A/production/_102220050_f36fd428-b600-4205-9558-4b7dcac3197e.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
