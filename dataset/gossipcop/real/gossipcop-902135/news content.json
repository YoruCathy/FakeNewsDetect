I meant no harm and did not mean to offend anyone at all. I love that my nephew feels free to express himself as we all should,\u201d Hamilton began in a series of tweets on Tuesday, December 26.\n\n\u201cMy deepest apologies for my behaviour as I realise it is really not acceptable for anyone, no matter where you are from, to marginalise or stereotype anyone,\u201d the British driver continued. \u201cI have always been in support of anyone living their life exactly how they wish and I hope I can be forgiven for this lapse in judgement.\u201d\n\nHamilton, 32, is referring to a now-deleted video posted to his Instagram Story on Monday, December 25.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sad right now. Look at my nephew,\u201d he said in the video before turning the camera to the little boy, who was wearing a pink and purple dress and holding a wand. \u201cWhy are you wearing a princess dress? Is this what you got for Christmas? Why did you ask for a princess dress for Christmas? Boys don\u2019t wear princess dresses!\u201d\n\nHamilton has been slammed by fans on social media for gender-shaming his nephew, who looked very happy in the video.\n\n\u201cI hope @LewisHamilton properly thinks and apologises to his nephew for that video,\u201d one user wrote on Twitter. \u201cThinks about why it is so horrible, and considers donating to a charity which supports LGBT youth. That video is a video so many of us have experienced. Gross. It sticks with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh. Lewis Hamilton is so ignorant. Telling his nephew that boys don\u2019t wear princess dresses His nephew looked so cute and happy in his Princess dress He can wear whatever he likes!\u201d another user tweeted.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lewis-hamilton-apologizes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lewis-hamilton-apologizes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lewis-hamilton-apologizes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lewis-hamilton-apologizes-for-saying-boys-dont-wear-princess-dresses/", "title": "Lewis Hamilton Apologizes for Saying \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Wear Princess Dresses\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton took to Twitter to apologize for telling his nephew \u2018boys don\u2019t wear princess dresses\u2019 \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lewis Hamilton Apologizes for Saying \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Wear Princess Dresses\u2019", "description": "Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton took to Twitter to apologize for telling his nephew \u2018boys don\u2019t wear princess dresses\u2019 \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lewis-hamilton-apologizes-for-saying-boys-dont-wear-princess-dresses/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:07:42+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lewis-hamilton-apologizes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lewis-hamilton-apologizes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-12-26T21:16:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:07:42+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton took to Twitter to apologize for telling his nephew \u2018boys don\u2019t wear princess dresses\u2019 \u2014 details", "title": "Lewis Hamilton Apologizes for Saying \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Wear Princess Dresses\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lewis-hamilton-apologizes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514322980.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
