Haskell resigned, along with two more high level executives.\n\nMund is speaking out about the controversy for the first time in an interview to CNN. She also discussed the organization's future with former Miss America Gretchen Carlson now at the helm, her support for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations.\n\nWhat went through your mind when you read the leaked emails?\n\n\"It's unfortunate and I kept thinking, what was said about me?

It's difficult, you never want to have that said about yourself, about your fellow sisters but you can just get stronger from it.\"\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180213134654-miss-america-cara-mund-ceo-00000000-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170911144321-miss-america-super-tease.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170911144321-miss-america-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/entertainment/miss-america-cara-mund-email-scandal/index.html", "title": "Miss America Cara Mund on the organization's recent email controversy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "entertainment", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2018-02-13T17:34:47Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/entertainment/miss-america-cara-mund-email-scandal/index.html", "title": "Miss America Cara Mund on the organization's recent email controversy", "description": "A little over three months after Cara Mund was crowned Miss America, a scandal rocked the organization.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170911144321-miss-america-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2018-02-13T17:34:47Z", "lastmod": "2018-02-13T18:53:55Z", "author": "Chloe Melas, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "Miss America Cara Mund on the organization's recent email controversy", "description": "A little over three months after Cara Mund was crowned Miss America, a scandal rocked the organization.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170911144321-miss-america-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "A little over three months after Cara Mund was crowned Miss America, a scandal rocked the organization.", "keywords": "entertainment, Miss America Cara Mund on the organization's recent email controversy - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170911144321-miss-america-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/13/entertainment/miss-america-cara-mund-email-scandal/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "entertainment,art-vid"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518451200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
