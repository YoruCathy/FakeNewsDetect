(For more on the incident, here\u2019s everything you need to know.)\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nIn the 12 months since, Kardashian West has undergone a mental and physical transformation, celebrated career milestones and confirmed that she\u2019s expecting her third child with husband Kanye West. Here\u2019s a look back at how she rebuilt her life over the course of a challenging, eventful year.\n\nSpotlight Shutdown\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the star was deeply shaken by the traumatic experience, and following the robbery, Kardashian West, 36, immediately returned to the United States and retreated entirely from the spotlight \u2014 both physically and digitally.\n\n\u201cShe has zero desire to resume her old life,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe\u2019s still figuring out what she wants to do. Her whole life has basically changed. Before, she was like a social butterfly \u2014 now she\u2019s much more withdrawn.\u201d\n\nThe star remained hunkered down at home in Los Angeles, spending time with West, 40, and their two kids: daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 1, with sources telling PEOPLE that Kardashian West would only leave her house \u201cfor overnight visits with the kids to Kris [Jenner]\u2018s and for important appointments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only \u2018positive\u2019 thing about the robbery is that Kim changed pace,\u201d a source told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cInstead of working nonstop, her life has slowed down significantly. She seems happy about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe very much likes spending every day with her kids,\u201d the source added. \u201cIn the past, it was very hard for her to be away from her kids for work. Now she gets to wake up with her kids and go to sleep with her kids.\u201d\n\nRinging in her 36th birthday just 18 days after the heist, Kardashian West kept things extremely low-key \u2014 a noticeable departure from her usual lavish celebrations. While she was scheduled to ring in the birthday at Las Vegas\u2019 Hakkasan Nightclub, she canceled the appearance and stayed home with her family.\n\nFilming KUWTK Resumes\n\nThree weeks after the robbery, production officially resumed on the family\u2019s reality show, and Kardashian West began stepping out in public here and there, either to grab frozen yogurt with friend Jonathan Cheban or to attend one of West\u2019s concerts.\n\nOf her choice to step back in front of KUWTK cameras,sources told PEOPLE Kardashian West did take a break from filming directly after the robbery but gradually resumed a few weeks later \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t due to any pressure from her famous siblings.\n\n\u201cNo one is pressuring her,\u201d one insider said. \u201cShe has the best support from her family.\u201d\n\nHer First Public Appearance\n\nSources told PEOPLE the incident \u201cscared everyone\u201d in the Kardashian/Jenner orbit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not taking chances,\u201d one insider said. \u201cIt was a really scary situation for the entire family, and it\u2019s just not worth it to put themselves out there unnecessarily. When something like this happens, everything changes. It changes the whole family \u2014 how and where they travel.\u201d\n\nBy mid-November, Kardashian West began planning to re-emerge into the public eye \u201cslowly,\u201d according to sources. To mark her first public appearance since the robbery, she selected the 2016 Angel Ball \u2014 which honored her late father Robert Kardashian, who died of esophageal cancer in 2003 \u2014 but West\u2019s hospitalization for exhaustion that same night spurred a change of plans.\n\nShe ultimately skipped the black-tie gala, flying back to Los Angeles from New York City to be by her husband\u2019s side \u2014 and her first public appearance ended up being her longtime makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic\u2019s Masterclass on Jan. 13 in Dubai.\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online\n\n\u201cKim was very emotional before the trip, and part of it was because she started thinking about the robbery,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe\u2019s getting sick of having to relive that awful night and just wants to move on.\u201d\n\nA second insider told PEOPLE the star was \u201cnervous before she left, but says it was the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was excited to spend time with her fans,\u201d added the source.\n\nSocial Media Return\n\nThough her family and friends gradually took over her website and app to share exclusive content, Kardashian West\u2019s Twitter and Instagram accounts remained completely dark for three full months after the robbery.\n\nShe officially returned to social media right before the Dubai trip, sharing a family photo of her, West and their two kids, on Instagram on Jan. 3.\n\nShe also debuted an heartwarming two-and-a-half-minute video on her website, offering fans a glimpse into life at home with her family. The home video montage included footage shot both before and after the Paris incident.\n\nLifestyle Changes\n\nThe robbery spurred a series of changes in Kardashian West\u2019s life, from her physical appearance to her personal security.\n\n\u201c[She will have] a much heavier security team,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThere will be a focus on security personnel who aren\u2019t in traditional clothing, and a lot more undercover security.\u201d\n\nOne month after the heist, Kardashian West also parted ways with family bodyguard Pascal Duvier, who was under her employment the night of the robbery but happened to be out shadowing her sisters, Kourtney, 37, and Kendall, 21, when the intruders broke in.\n\n\u201cPascal no longer works for Kim and Kanye, but he wasn\u2019t fired,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cHe instead reassigned himself to another family for professional reasons. Pascal thought that he did let down Kim and didn\u2019t do his job properly in Paris. They all agreed that it was better for Kim and Kanye to hire a completely new security team.\u201d\n\nImage zoom INSTAR\n\nAs for her physical appearance? Kardashian West debuted a much more toned-down look than her previous glam self \u2014 swapping out her eye-catching diamonds for a much more subtle wedding band and ditching her chainmail and latex dresses in favor of baggy t-shirts, sweatpants and a fresh, contour-free face.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely acting like a new Kim,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe wears both minimal makeup and jewelry. The new Kim seems less flashy. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t need that now to be happy.\u201d\n\nWorking on Her Marriage\n\nThe combination of Kardashian West\u2019s robbery and West\u2019s subsequent health crisis (spurred by his November hospitalization for exhaustion) led to months of marital strain as the couple was bombarded with rumors of divorce.\n\nNevertheless, the two worked hard to get back on track, and by early 2017, things appeared to be on the up and up.\n\n\u201cThey seem to be doing much better,\u201d a source told PEOPLE in February, adding that Kardashian West seemed \u201cmuch happier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having fun together again,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe struggles that they had for the past few months seem to have mostly past.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the source confirmed West was still in therapy and receiving medical help.\n\n\u201cIt all seems to be helping him recover,\u201d the source said. \u201cKim has nothing but great things to say about Kanye.\u201d\n\nReliving the Terror\n\nPart of Kardashian West\u2019s healing process after the robbery included having to relive the incident over and over again, especially as French authorities continued to make major headway in the case.\n\nOver the course of this year, the star and her family have openly discussed the robbery in several interviews \u2014 and on emotional episodes of KUWTK, which documented the aftermath in great detail.\n\n\u201cWell, we are damned if we do and damned if we don\u2019t,\u201d sister Khlo\u00e9 told PEOPLE of the family\u2019s decision to include that aspect of their lives on their reality show. \u201cWe are so vulnerable and [have opened] up our lives so much in the past that interestingly enough, if we don\u2019t show things fans get really angry \u2014 they feel as if that was taken away from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think for Kim, it was maybe therapeutic for her,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s also something that disgustingly happens to a lot of other people, and we always come from a place of honesty.\u201d\n\nCareer Milestones\n\n2017 has been an exciting year for Kardashian West professionally: In addition to appearing on a slew of high-profile magazine covers and explanding her line of Kimoji merch, the reality star followe little sister Kylie Jenner\u2018s lead and launched her own beauty line in June.\n\nImage zoom Stefanie Keenan/Getty\n\nThe first product she created, a $48 cr\u00e8me contour and highlight kit, sold out in just three hours, bringing in an estimated $14.4 million. (The kits come in four different shades and include a contour pen, a highlight pen and a double-ended blending brush.)\n\nShe has since expanded the line with the launch of powder highlighter and contour kits.\n\nExpanding the Family\n\nAfter two high-risk pregnancies, Kardashian West is taking a different route for baby no. 3: surrogacy.\n\nIn June, sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the star and her husband had hired a surrogate to carry their third child. By Sept. 6, PEOPLE confirmed the surrogate is pregnant. A separate source later confirmed that Kardashian West and West are \u201cthrilled\u201d to be expecting a daughter in January.\n\n\u201cThe entire family is over the moon,\u201d one insider said. \u201cKim had been looking for a surrogate for months until recently, when she found the perfect candidate. Given her health scares in the past, Kim felt the need to hire a surrogacy agency that helped serve as the liaison in finding a healthy woman who would be a great surrogate option for her and Kanye. Both of them have been super involved in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want everything to be perfect and for the baby to be extremely healthy,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any complications, and Kim is providing an ideal eating regimen and diet so everyone knows what the baby is consuming before it\u2019s born.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t wait to add a new addition to their family and are just so incredibly happy,\u201d another source said. \u201cNorth isn\u2019t the most thrilled to be a big sister again \u2014 she\u2019s had the tendency to get really jealous about Saint and wants all of the attention to herself, but Kim and Kanye think it\u2019s just a phase and are hoping she will grow out of it.\u201d\n\nKardashian West confirmed that she and her husband are expecting in a recent sneak peek at this season of KUWTK.\n\n\u201cWhat happens every time I say, \u2018Guess what?\u2019 \u201d she asked her sister Khlo\u00e9, 33, in the teaser.\n\n\u201cPregnant, or the person\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 responded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby!\u201d Kardashian West exclaimed.\n\nSeeing the Silver Lining\n\nKardashian West has often reflected on how her harrowing experience turned her into a \u201cdifferent person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was probably no secret, you see it on the show \u2014 me being flashy \u2014 but I was definitely materialistic before,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres in April. \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything bad about having things and working hard to get those things \u2014 and I\u2019m really proud of everyone that\u2019s around me that\u2019s successful. But I\u2019m so happy that my kids get this me. And that this is who is raising my kids. Because I just don\u2019t care about that stuff anymore, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start crying, but \u2026 I\u2019m such a different person. I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F03%2Fkim-kardashian15-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F01%2Fkim-kardashian31.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fkim-kardashian12.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1175&h=615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fkim-kardashian5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1175&h=615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fkim-kardashian5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-life-after-paris-robbery-2/", "title": "How Kim Kardashian West Rebuilt Her Life 1 Year After the Paris Robbery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "description": "In the past year, the star has undergone a mental and physical transformation, celebrated career milestones and confirmed that she's expecting her\u00a0third child\u00a0with husband\u00a0Kanye West", "og": {"title": "How Kim Kardashian West Rebuilt Her Life 1 Year After the Paris Robbery", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-life-after-paris-robbery-2/", "description": "It\u2019s been one year since Kim Kardashian West\u2018s terrifying Paris heist \u2014 and she has come a long way.
