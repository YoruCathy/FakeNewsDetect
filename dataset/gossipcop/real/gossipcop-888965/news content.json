Donna, played by Erinn Hayes, was killed off at the end of season 1 and later replaced by James\u2019 longtime King of Queens costar.\n\n\u201cSeason 1, there was very good chemistry between Kevin and Erin and I always heard, \u2018Oh Kevin and Leah \u2026 the chemistry!\u2019 I was like \u2018Ok, alright,\u2019\u201d Roach explained. \u201cThen when you see it, you\u2019re like \u2018Oh, okay!\u2019 She makes him funnier. I don\u2019t know what it is. He\u2019s very funny as it is, but when you add her to the mix [and] they start playing off each other, it\u2019s really incredible.\u201d\n\nFans of the show were shocked when Hayes didn\u2019t return for season 2 and they wanted answers. So in an October 14 interview, James revealed that it really just came down to storyline. \u201cThe plot of the show didn\u2019t have enough drive,\u201d he told the New York Daily News. \u201cIf we got through a second season, I wouldn\u2019t see us getting through a third one. We were literally just running out of ideas.\u201d\n\nFollowing the interview, fans were even more unhappy. When they began tweeting their disappointment with the show, Hayes showed her appreciation by liking many of the messages.\n\nOne user wrote, \u201cWe were literally just running out of ideas\u201d \u2013 Kevin James. Based off this I don\u2019t expect your show to last very long @hayeslady is better off,\u201d and she liked it. She also liked a tweet saying, \u201cIf Kevin Can Wait, so can we \u2014 for you to have a bigger career than him!!!\u201d\n\nThe show has not yet revealed how Donna died, but decided to kill her off \u201cout of respect for the character,\u201d executive producer Rob Long previously said. \u201cThe goal was to give Kevin\u2019s character a real drive and a real predicament [involving] how a family comes back together [after tragedy],\u201d he told TVLine.\n\n\u201cTrue, I\u2019ve been let go from the show. Very sad, I had a great experience season 1,\u201d Hayes tweeted when the news broke. \u201cThank you for all the support from our wonderful fans.\u201d\n\nKevin Can Wait airs on CBS on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C863px%2C453px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kevin-james-chris-roach-kevin-can-wait.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/erinn-hayes-kevin-james-kevin-can-wait.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C863px%2C453px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kevin-can-wait-star-leah-remini-makes-kevin-james-funnier/", "title": "Kevin Can Wait\u2019 Star: Leah Remini Makes Kevin James Funnier", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Fans may be sad that Erinn Hayes is no longer on 'Kevin Can Wait,' but one of the show\u2019s stars understands the transition \u2014 read Chris Roach\u2019s new interview", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 Star: Leah Remini Makes Kevin James Funnier", "description": "Fans may be sad that Erinn Hayes is no longer on 'Kevin Can Wait,' but one of the show\u2019s stars understands the transition \u2014 read Chris Roach\u2019s new interview", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kevin-can-wait-star-leah-remini-makes-kevin-james-funnier/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-24T20:57:58+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C863px%2C453px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C863px%2C453px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-23T20:31:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-24T20:57:58+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Fans may be sad that Erinn Hayes is no longer on 'Kevin Can Wait,' but one of the show\u2019s stars understands the transition \u2014 read Chris Roach\u2019s new interview", "title": "\u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 Star: Leah Remini Makes Kevin James Funnier", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C863px%2C453px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508790672.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
