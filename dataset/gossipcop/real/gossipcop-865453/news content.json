The news release by the former district attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr., played a big role at the first trial. But his opinions about the evidence and why he decided against charges won\u2019t be heard this time around, Judge O\u2019Neill decided.\n\nWhat the Jury Will Hear\n\nAfter Mr. Castor declined to bring charges, Ms. Constand sued Mr. Cosby in 2005. The case was settled confidentially in 2006 with a financial payment made by Mr. Cosby to Ms. Constand.\n\nAt the first trial, references to the civil case were barred. This time, Mr. Cosby has lifted his objections, and jurors can hear more about the lawsuit, including the payment amount.\n\nEach side is expected to try to use the settlement in their favor: the defense team arguing that it supports their view of Ms. Constand as a money seeker, the prosecution suggesting that the payment must reflect some kind of admission by Mr. Cosby that he indeed did something wrong.\n\nOne part of the civil suit was allowed in last time around: Mr. Cosby\u2019s deposition testimony in which he admitted giving quaaludes to women for consensual sex. Judge O\u2019Neill has yet to rule whether he will allow the testimony to be admitted in the retrial.\n\nThe Jury Is Local\n\nLast time, the jury was drawn from Pittsburgh and bused 300 miles to the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., after Mr. Cosby said he worried that all the pretrial publicity had affected potential jurors in the local area. This time, however, he has made no objections, and all jurors come from Montgomery County. As before, they will be sequestered during the trial.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/09/arts/09COSBY/09COSBY-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/09/arts/09COSBY1/09COSBY1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/09/arts/09COSBY/09COSBY-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Graham Bowley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/arts/bill-cosby-retrial.html", "title": "Bill Cosby Returns to Court.
