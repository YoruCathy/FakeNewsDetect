The series is a spinoff of the 2010 animated film, Tangled, starring Levi and Mandy Moore.\n\nAction comedy series Chuck aired on NBC from 2007 to 2012. The series starred Levi as Chuck Bartowski, a nerd who has all of the government's secrets downloaded into his brain. Assigned to protect Chuck is the beautiful but deadly CIA agent Sarah Walker (Strahovksi). Chuck and Sarah have to work together to foil terrorist plots, defeat enemy spies, and diffuse bombs. Though the two adopt a fake relationship as part of their cover, the pair eventually become a couple in season 3 and marry in the season 4 finale. Due to low ratings, the show faced threats of cancellation with each season, but with the help of a devoted fan base, the series was able to last for five seasons.\n\nAs reported by E! Online, The two leads of Chuck will reunite on TV for the first time in six years for the season 2 premiere of Disney's animated series, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series features Levi in the lead role of Eugene/Flynn Rider, the character he voiced in the Tangled movie. Strahovski will guest star in the season 2 premiere as Eugene's ex-fianc\u00e9e, Stalyan. Like their Chuck characters, Eugene and Stalyan have a deep romantic history and were once a great team. In a clip for E! Online, Levi and Strahovksi discuss their characters and talk about working together again - see the clip on E! Online's site.\n\nAdvertising [x]\n\nDisney's computer-animated musical adventure film, Tangled was a love story between Levi's character, Flynn Rider, and Moore's Rapunzel. Nominated for several awards, Tangled was considered a critical and commercial success. In 2017, the story was brought back in the form of a TV movie on the Disney Channel, Tangled Ever After, which evolved into Tangled: The Series, with the two lead roles reprised by Levi and Moore. After its first season, the show was retitled Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure.\n\nEven though Chuck's series finale was able to wrap up loose ends and give the characters a proper send-off, Levi has been working on reviving the series as a film. Whether this happens or not, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure will finally reunite Levi and Strahovksi, which could be fun for fans of Chuck.\n\nSeason 2 of Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure premieres Sunday at 7:45 PM ET on the Disney Channel.\n\nSource: E!
