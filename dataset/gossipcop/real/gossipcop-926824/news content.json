How dare any one of you judge me and say that on a social platform. It doesn\u2019t make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers. I will always love Chris and Jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Ftiffany-thornto.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Ftiffany-thornton-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Ftiffany-thornton-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/tiffany-thornton-pregnant-third-child/", "title": "Disney Channel Alum Tiffany Thornton Is Pregnant with Her Third Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Babies,Expecting,News,Tiffany Thornton,TV", "news_keywords": "Babies,Expecting,News,Tiffany Thornton,TV", "description": "Tiffany Thornton is already mom to two sons: Kenneth James,\u00a05, and Bentley Cash, 4", "og": {"title": "Disney Channel Alum Tiffany Thornton Is Pregnant with Her Third Child", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/tiffany-thornton-pregnant-third-child/", "description": "Tiffany Thornton is pregnant!
