Especially not how close they seem to have become in so short a time.\n\n\"Abel is upset about Selena hanging out with Justin, especially twice in the same week,\" an inside source told E! News.\n\nBut what's the problem if Abelena were already donezo by the time Jelena started chilling? Did the Weeknd expect Selena to lay low for a month and not hang out with boys, or something? Though, to be fair, Sel hanging out with Justin, her most famous ex, twice in a week before even announcing their breakup \u2014 and the resulting media storm \u2014 must have been a shock to The Weeknd.\n\nDespite The Weeknd being in his feels about Jelena chilling, insiders are still insisting the pair are keeping things purely platonic.\n\n\"Selena and Justin have reconnected because they have gone through similar stuff in the past couple years with being physically and mentally exhausted from touring and just dealing with the anxiety and pressure of growing up in the public eye,\" another source told E! News. \"They have always had a strong connection, and they are leaning on each other as friends. They are both there for each other to talk and support one another.\"\n\n\n\nWell, that settles that. Though, I doubt Jelena shippers are going to let a little ~friendship~ get in the way of their OTP.\n\nNoelle Devoe is the Entertainment Web Editor at Seventeen.com.
