Authorities allegedly found cocaine on the actor, and he was detained but not arrested. It was reported that a random baggage check uncovered trace amounts of the class A drug in his bag.\n\nEditors at The Sun newspaper claim the actor was caught by sniffer dogs at the airport, and border officials later found traces of white powder on his personal items.\n\nHeaton was flying into the U.S. ahead of Netflix\u2019s premiere party for Stranger Things second season, and the actor was noticeably absent on Thursday as his co-stars Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder, Gaten Matarazzo and Noah Schnapp posed for pictures on the red carpet.\n\nHis brush with the law may also cast doubt on any future filming commitments for Stranger Things, as it is feared he may be banned from entering the U.S. in future.\n\nA statement obtained by People from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection says any \u201cforeign national may be inadmissible due to the commission of a crime involving drug possession.\u201d\n\n\u201cA violation, conspiracy to violate or simply an attempt to violate any U.S. State, federal or any foreign government controlled substance violation renders a foreign national inadmissible to the United States,\u201d it reads.\n\nA rep for Heaton has yet to comment on the reports.\n\nThe second season of Stranger Things premiered on Netflix on Friday.", "images":
