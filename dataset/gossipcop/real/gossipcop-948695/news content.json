NBC even hung out the possibility of a movie to wrap up that cliffhanger that season two ended on.\n\nAlas for fans of the show, it appears none of that will happen. Timeless co-creator Shawn Ryan informed fans on Monday via Twitter that the program is, in all likelihood, done.\n\n\" @ SPTV has notified @ TheRealKripke and me that efforts to land # Timeless at another network have sadly failed. While Sony will continue to look at any and all options, actor deals have expired and it appears there will be no Season 3 or beyond,\" Ryan tweeted.\n\n\"Discussions still take place between @ SPTV and @ NBC about a possible 2 hour movie to conclude the # Timeless story, but there are considerable economic obstacles that make it an uncertainty. We will update you when we know more.\"\n\nTimeless barely made this season's top 100 shows among adults 18-49, the demographic most advertising is sold on, averaging a 1.2 rating in the demo including seven-day DVR playback, according to Nielsen. It tied with another low-rated drama, Blindspot, to rank 23rd among NBC's 37 programs this season.\n\nIn fact, Timeless barely made it to season 2, let alone season 3, after being revived following a brief cancellation last year. It would have had to demonstrate ratings improvement to stick around, but it never gained the momentum it needed, despite a very loyal following of fans who undertook a #RenewTimeless campaign on Twitter that generated a lot of buzz.\n\nTimeless wasn't the only show canceled by NBC that was trying to find another home. Mindy Kaling's Champions was recently rebuffed by Netflix.\n\nIn the end, NBC had little financial incentive to keep the low-rated show going, since it does not produce the program; Sony Pictures Television does. Having a back-end stake saved a couple other recent programs, including Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Last Man Standing, from cancellation.\n\n\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine, for example, is produced by Universal Television (an NBC sister-company), and Last Man Standing is owned by 20th Century Fox Television,\" notes Caity Lamb, associate media director, national broadcast, at Harmelin Media, a media agency based near Philadelphia. \"By taking ownership of these programs, NBC and Fox improve their bottom lines while delivering programming that loyal audiences are eager to see.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fe131bd582e06c68c2548634779b238b?s=400&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/dam/imageserve/958943572/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F958943572%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F958943572%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toni Fitzgerald"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2018/07/02/timeless-is-canceled-co-creator-says-no-one-bit-on-season-3/", "title": "'Timeless' Is Canceled: Co-Creator Says No One Bit On Season 3", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "'Timeless' Is Canceled: Co-Creator Says No One Bit On Season 3", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F958943572%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2018-07-02T16:04:06-04:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702212408/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2018/07/02/timeless-is-canceled-co-creator-says-no-one-bit-on-season-3/", "description": "Fans of the cult time travel show had been hoping another network or a streaming service would pick up the drama, but the cast's options have expired.
