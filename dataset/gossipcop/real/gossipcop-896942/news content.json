Given the release of Ridley's latest film, The Last Jedi, in December, the game was Star Wars themed.\n\nThe game, a long-running bit on Fallon's show, has guests put on headphones and listen to loud music while Fallon says a phrase and they must read his lips. In true Star Wars fashion, Ridley's headphones were adorned with hair buns the likes of Princess Leia.\n\nThe first clue Ridley, dressed in a Ulla Johnson jumpsuit, was challenged to guess was the famous opening lines from Star Wars films, \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away \u2026\" The Last Jedi star was quickly able to get the last bit of the line, shouting, \"Something, something, far, far away,\" then succeeded in guessing correctly seconds later.\n\nNext, it was Fallon's turn to try on the Leia headphones. Ridley mouthed the name \"Lando Calrissian,\" the ruler of Cloud City made famous by Billy Dee Williams in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. \"Lactic acid,\" Fallon guessed, seemingly forgetting the game's Star Wars theme. After a few more off-base guesses, the host got it right. \"I forgot it was Star Wars themed,\" Fallon laughed.\n\nThe next clue Ridley had to guess was Yoda's famous inspirational quote to Luke Skywalker, \"Do or do not, there is no try.\" It took the star a few guesses, but she finally was tipped off by Fallon's Yoda-like expressions and got the answer.\n\nThe final clue was Leia's famous plea in 1977's A New Hope, \"Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\" After several incorrect guesses of \"pickle\" and \"Elmo,\" Fallon got it right.\n\nWatch the video below.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2016/12/aaeaaqaaaaaaaafiaaaajgyxmtvhnmm0ltcynjetngvmmy1iyzvllwq4odlhyzqwzjyznw.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Shanley", "Patrick.Shanley Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/daisy-ridley-plays-star-wars-themed-whisper-challenge-jimmy-fallon-1062390", "title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \"Whisper Challenge\" With Jimmy Fallon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/daisy-ridley-plays-star-wars-themed-whisper-challenge-jimmy-fallon-1062390", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \"Whisper Challenge\" With Jimmy Fallon", "description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \"Whisper Challenge\" With Jimmy Fallon", "description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/daisy-ridley-plays-star-wars-themed-whisper-challenge-jimmy-fallon-1062390", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \"Whisper Challenge\" With Jimmy Fallon", "sailthru.description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "sailthru.author": "Patrick Shanley", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-28 21:30:40", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Daisy Ridley,Jimmy Fallon,The Tonight Show"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511875840.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
