The song was a cover of Brandi Carlile's signature hit \"The Story\" \u2014 as performed by Ramirez during \"Song Beneath the Song,\" the season seven musical episode of Grey's Anatomy.\n\nAnd while Ramirez's Callie was never seen onscreen, the character did have a prominent role. Arizona, newly single after breaking things off with Carina (Stefania Spampinato), decided to move back to New York so her daughter with Callie could have both of her parents in the same city. During Thursday's finale, Arizona revealed that Callie was single now as well. What's more, Arizona told April and Richard that she was having feelings again for Callie \u2014 with the latter seemingly of the same mindset.\n\nWhat did you think of Ramirez's cameo and how Arizona's storyline ended?
