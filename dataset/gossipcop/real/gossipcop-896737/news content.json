Prince Harry went for a workout at a gym on Tuesday, November 28, just one day after announcing his engagement to Meghan Markle. Harry, 33, wore a beanie and gray sweat suit for the outing.\n\nPalace officials revealed on Tuesday, November 28, that the couple will marry at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle in England in May 2018.\n\n\u201cHer Majesty The Queen has granted permission for the wedding to take place at the Chapel,\u201d Kensington Palace said in a statement. \u201cThe Royal Family will pay for the wedding. Further details about the wedding will be announced in due course.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s communications secretary added, \u201cPrince Harry and Ms. Markle are delighted that the beautiful grounds of Windsor Castle will be where they begin their lives together as a married couple. The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved. This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters of the bride and groom.\u201d\n\nHarry proposed to the Suits actress at Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace in London earlier this month. \u201cIt was just an amazing surprise,\u201d Markle, 36, raved in a joint BBC News interview on Monday, November 27, of her husband-to-be popping the question. \u201cIt was just so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee. As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing. I was like, \u2018Can I say \u2018yes\u2019 now?\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Harry recalled convincing Markle to join him on a romantic trip to Botswana, Africa, just weeks after they met. \u201cWe camped out with each other under the stars,\u201d he said. \u201cShe came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prince-harry4.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prince-harry4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1292px%2C679px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prince-harry4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1292px%2C679px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/prince-harry-steps-out-for-workout-after-engagement-news/", "title": "Prince Harry Steps Out for Workout After Engagement News", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Prince Harry went for a workout one day after announcing his engagement to Meghan Markle \u2013 see the pic!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prince Harry Steps Out for Workout After Engagement News", "description": "Prince Harry went for a workout one day after announcing his engagement to Meghan Markle \u2013 see the pic!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/prince-harry-steps-out-for-workout-after-engagement-news/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:20+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prince-harry4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1292px%2C679px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prince-harry4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1292px%2C679px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-28T20:25:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:20+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Prince Harry went for a workout one day after announcing his engagement to Meghan Markle \u2013 see the pic!", "title": "Prince Harry Steps Out for Workout After Engagement News", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/prince-harry4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1292px%2C679px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511900707.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
