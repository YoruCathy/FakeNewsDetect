Kill one of the icy villains, it transpired, and all of the wights created by that particular Walker will instantly drop dead. (Permanently dead.)\n\nRegenerating resistance leader-turned-wight hunter Beric Dondarrion was quick to take things a step further, speculating that if the Night King himself were to be eliminated, all of his creations \u2013 the entire army of the dead and possibly the Walkers too \u2013 would disappear too. \u201cKill him. He turned them all,\u201d Dondarrion urged Jon Snow.\n\nAs it turns out, Jon Snow did not know nothing: that fairly tempting theory proved to be correct, as The Long Night, the third episode of season eight, showed. When Arya managed to stab the Night King with Valyrian steel (specifically in his gut, where the Children of the Forest attacked him with dragonglass during his creation), she shattered him into thousands of icy shards, causing instant death among the seemingly infinite zombies that were rapidly over-running Winterfell.\n\nBut even though the Night King is dead, and has taken with him the increasingly ridiculous theories that were piling up like sacrificial zombies on pyres of Dragonglass, questions still remain\u2026", "images":
