Among other allegations, she had claimed White had sent her lewd text messages and forced her to watch sexually disturbing videos, including videos sexualizing human fecal matter.\n\n\u201cThere are powerful forces at play which prevent Ms. Zawaideh from speaking about the allegations and ultimate outcome of the sexual harassment case,\u201d Bohm\u2019s statement said Wednesday. \u201cBefore Mr. White made his comment, Ms. Zawaideh believed that this matter was in the past, and she was happy to put the situation behind her so she can focus on her blossoming music career. Unfortunately, by his recent comments and conduct, Mr. White has minimized the problem of sexual harassment in this country.\u201d\n\nMORE:Shaun White wins gold medal in men's halfpipe\n\nCOMMENTARY:Shaun White's Winter Olympics legacy is not all golden\n\nMORE:Shaun White is America's most clutch performer in Winter Games\n\nBohm\u2019s statement said White\u2019s comment impugns his client\u2019s character.\n\n\u201cNo woman wants to be called a `gossip\u2019 or a liar by the harasser,\u201d Bohm said. \u201cMinimizing sexual harassment maximizes the harm to Ms. Zawaideh. Hopefully, before our country declares someone `the best of the U.S.,\u2019 there will be investigation and due diligence.\u201d\n\nZawaideh filed suit against White in 2016, which White contested until its settlement last year.\n\nAfter initially dismissing the allegations this week as gossip, he since has taken a more conciliatory stance.\n\n\u201cI regret my behavior many years ago and am sorry that I made anyone \u2014 particularly someone I considered a friend \u2014 uncomfortable,\u201d he said in a statement released to media outlets. \u201cI have grown and changed as a person, as we all grow and change, and am proud of who I am today.\u201d\n\nAnd he apologized Wednesday during an appearance on NBC's Today.\n\n\n\n\"I'm truly sorry that I chose the word gossip,\" he said. \u201cIt was a poor choice of words to describe such a sensitive subject in the world today.\n\n\n\n\"I'm just truly sorry. I was so overwhelmed with just wanting to talk about how amazing today was and share my experience, but yeah.\"\n\nThe terms of the settlement in the case have not been publicly disclosed. The settlement barely received any other media attention when USA TODAY Sports reported it in May, but after the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement raised awareness of sexual misconduct, the allegations have been resurrected on the global stage of the Olympics in South Korea.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6505d0268cd040ffc0e580ec98b17d60c9cc9a5e/c=0-383-3035-2098/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541580652115387-USP-OLYMPICS-SNOWBOARD-MENS-HALFPIPE-FINAL-97443922.JPG?width=3035&height=1715&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5733561107001_5733551165001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6505d0268cd040ffc0e580ec98b17d60c9cc9a5e/c=0-383-3035-2098/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541580652115387-USP-OLYMPICS-SNOWBOARD-MENS-HALFPIPE-FINAL-97443922.JPG?width=3035&height=1715&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/14/attorney-shaun-white-accuser-fires-back-over-sexual-harassment-comments/339718002/", "title": "Attorney for Shaun White accuser fires back over sexual harassment comments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Attorney for Shaun White accuser fires back over sexual harassment comments", "description": "His client had agreed to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against the Olympian last year", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/14/attorney-shaun-white-accuser-fires-back-over-sexual-harassment-comments/339718002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6505d0268cd040ffc0e580ec98b17d60c9cc9a5e/c=0-383-3035-2098/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541580652115387-USP-OLYMPICS-SNOWBOARD-MENS-HALFPIPE-FINAL-97443922.JPG?width=3035&height=1715&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3035, "height": 1715}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Brent Schrotenboer and Josh Peter", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "His client had agreed to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against the Olympian last year", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6505d0268cd040ffc0e580ec98b17d60c9cc9a5e/c=0-383-3035-2098/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541580652115387-USP-OLYMPICS-SNOWBOARD-MENS-HALFPIPE-FINAL-97443922.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Attorney for Shaun White accuser fires back over sexual harassment comments", "description": "His client had agreed to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against the Olympian last year"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
