I happened to be dating a woman, and people started taking pictures of us walking to our car after dinner. I [was] holding her hand, and I realized that I have two options: I can let go of her hand and, when asked about it, I can say that my private life is my private life. Or I could not let go and own it.\u201d\n\nHeard, who previously married Johnny Depp, finalized her divorce from the actor earlier this year. But before her rocky marriage became highly publicized, Heard was dealing with a different kind of unwanted attention over her sexuality.\n\nWhen she starred opposite Nicolas Cage in 2011\u2019s \u201cDrive Angry,\u201d followed by \u201cThe Rum Diary\u201d that same year with her ex, Heard claimed critics believed she was putting her career in jeopardy as the romantic lead.\n\n\u201cThey pointed to no other working romantic lead, no other actress, that was out,\u201d said Heard. \u201cI didn\u2019t come out. I was never in. It\u2019s limiting, that LGBTQ thing. It served a function as an umbrella for marginalized people to whom rights were being denied, but it loses its efficacy because of the nuanced nature of humanity.\n\n\"As we become more educated and expand the facts of our nature, we keep adding letters. It was a great shield, but now we\u2019re stuck behind it. It\u2019s so important to resist labels. I don\u2019t care how many letters you add. At some point, it\u2019s going to spell \u2018WE ARE HUMAN.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese days, Heard is more interested in pushing for quality, especially within Hollywood.\n\n\u201cHistory tends to favor those on the right side of it,\u201d said Heard. \u201cWhether it\u2019s civil rights in 1962 or suffrage in 1914 or gay rights in 2007. All of these debates seemed specific at the time, but if you pull back to the macro, there\u2019s a trend: fairness. Justice is not as nuanced or delicate as it\u2019s made out to be. And as the texture of our culture changes, [equality] will manifest differently in other debates.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/Gwyneth-Paltrow-GETTY-cropped.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/270/152/Brad-Paisley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/Reuters_AmberHeard.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Reuters_AmberHeard.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Reuters_AmberHeard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amber-heard-addresses-her-sexuality-i-dont-identify-as-anything", "title": "Amber Heard addresses her sexuality: 'I don't identify as anything'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Amber Heard isn\u2019t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Amber Heard addresses her sexuality: 'I don't identify as anything'", "dcterms.abstract": "Amber Heard isn\u2019t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Amber Heard isn\u2019t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:7a9b0d7e-ab34-5788-81bf-695cff675961", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-11-14", "dcterms.created": "2017-11-14T15:07:12-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-11-14T15:23:09-05:00", "og": {"title": "Amber Heard addresses her sexuality: 'I don't identify as anything'", "description": "Amber Heard isn\u2019t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Reuters_AmberHeard.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amber-heard-addresses-her-sexuality-i-dont-identify-as-anything", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Amber Heard addresses her sexuality: 'I don't identify as anything'", "description": "Amber Heard isn\u2019t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/Reuters_AmberHeard.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/amber-heard-addresses-her-sexuality-i-dont-identify-as-anything"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Style,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "style,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
