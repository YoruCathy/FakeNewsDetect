The album, which included the platinum hit \"Close\" featuring Tove Lo, debuted as the No. 1 selling album of the week. In 2017, Nick released a new single \"Find You\" off of his upcoming album. Jonas also wrote an original song titled \"Home\" for the movie \"Ferdinand,\" released by FOX Animation. As an actor, Jonas garnered unanimous critical praise for his lead role in the 2016 Sundance Film Festival favorite \"Goat,\" which was produced by and featured James Franco.
