Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C.\n\nThe list of award recipients included singer Lionel Richie, hip hop artist LL Cool J, television producer Norman Lear and dancer Carmen de Lavallade.\n\nEstefan is the first Cuban-American artist to receive the high distinction.\n\nFront row from left, 2017 Kennedy Center Honorees Carmen de Lavallade, Norman Lear, Gloria Estefan and Kennedy Center President Deborah F.

Rubenstein are photographed following the State Department dinner for the Kennedy Center Honors, Saturday, Dec. 2, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)\n\n\u201cThis award is the best example of what immigrants can do to contribute to the richness of this country,\u201d Estefan told the Nuevo Herald on Monday. \u201cAnd in the personal sphere, it represents a way of honoring my father [Jos\u00e9 Fajardo, 1933-1980] who thanked President Kennedy shortly before he was assassinated, for having taken him out of prison in Cuba [after participating in the Bay of Pigs invasion].\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old singer emotionally added that the award also goes to her mother, Gloria Fajardo, who died in June.\n\nOn the decision of President Donald Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, not to attend the Kennedy Center event, the singer said: \u201cI thought it was very sensible that President Donald Trump and his wife did not attend the ceremony. Otherwise, it would have become a political event and not an opportunity to pay homage to the artists.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time in more than 20 years that a president has missed the annual celebration of artistic excellence. In August, the White House said that the presidential couple would decline the invitation so that the honorees could celebrate \u201cwithout any political distraction.\u201d\n\nEstefan did not spend any more time talking about Trump. Instead, she is looking ahead to January when her musical \u201cOn Your Feet,\u201d about her career beginnings with husband Emilio Estefan, \u201cwhich is already being presented in the Netherlands,\u201d will begin a run in Washington, D.C. And in 2018 she will record an album of Brazilian music.\n\n\u201cChristmas will be spent in Miami,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe ceremony will air on Tuesday, Dec. 26 on CBS, at 9 p.m.\n\nFollow Arturo Arias-Polo on Twitter: @arturoariaspolo", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/artbaseltickets-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/miami-300x187.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/art-basel-jordan-1s-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/IceCreamMuseum04EKM-300x184.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/logos-badge-enfuego-150x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/logos-badge-somiami-150x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/the-bows-and-ties-e1512428175233-300x186.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/badge-pro-tip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/badge-miami-gem.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/06/CafeRoval_HighRes-6-1-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/segafredo-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/1280_hannah_jeter_021817_getty642823496-1-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/badge-shhh.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/author-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/themes/miami/images/miami.com-logo-live.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/2017-Kennedy-Center-Honors8-e1512423314687-1200x779.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/APTOPIX-Kennedy-Center-Honors-State-Department-1024x933.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/badge-super-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/leonardo_dicaprio-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/2017-Kennedy-Center-Honors8-e1512423314687.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/pitbull-300x199.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/wwd-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/24301212_875109532652025_3738380603271903714_n-e1512671457470-300x198.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/People-John-Mayer-e1512597986112-300x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/floribama-shore-300x158.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/birdman-300x173.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853im_/http://www.miami.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/2017-Kennedy-Center-Honors8-e1512423314687.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208031853/http://www.miami.com/miami-news/trump-was-a-no-show-but-gloria-estefan-still-got-her-kennedy-center-honors-177188/", "title": "Trump was a no-show, but Gloria Estefan still got her Kennedy Center Honors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "copyright": "\u00a9 Miami.com.
