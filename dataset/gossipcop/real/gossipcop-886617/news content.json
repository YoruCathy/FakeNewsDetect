Since the allegations against Weinstein came to light, McGowan has called out many other Hollywood insiders, including Ben Affleck. On Instagram she posted a screenshot from Twitter, saying a tweet prompted the social network to temporarily freeze her account.\n\nTWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE. #ROSEARMY #whywomendontreport A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Oct 11, 2017 at 9:19pm PDT\n\nOthers on Twitter quickly rushed to her defense, noting how, more often than not, accounts that threaten even physical violence are allowed to stay. Many noted how far-right and white supremacists still remain on the platform while voices like McGowan\u2019s find themselves silenced.\n\nIn the meantime, my friend @rosemcgowan had her account suspended for calling out Harvey Weinstein for being a sexual predator. https://t.co/zjIty7ynnv \u2014 Shaun King (@ShaunKing) October 12, 2017\n\nAfter hours of silence, Twitter has finally issued a response. According to a tweet, Twitter suspended the account because she posted a \u201cprivate phone number.\u201d The company added that it is now in touch with McGowan.\n\nHere are the tweets:\n\nWe have been in touch with Ms. McGowan\u2019s team. We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service. 1/3 \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017\n\nThe Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future. 2/3 \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017", "images": ["https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/insta-icon-circle-in.svg", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-805310h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/10/p-mcgowan.jpg", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/fb-icon-circle-fb.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjincfastcoprod/1/H.24.4--NS/0/5658306", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/linkedin-icon-circle-li.svg", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/tw-icon-circle-tw.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1389601884702365&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/10/p-mcgowan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fastcompany.com/40480636/twitter-says-it-locked-rose-mcgowans-account-because-she-posted-a-phone-number", "title": "Twitter says it locked Rose McGowan\u2019s account because she posted a phone number", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Actress Rose McGowan, who has taken to social media to denounce Harvey Weinstein and others involved in his sexual assault scandal over the last few days, had her Twitter account locked late last night.
