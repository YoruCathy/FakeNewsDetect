The network made the announcement after Seacrest broke the news on Thursday morning\u2019s \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan.\u201d\n\nSeacrest will earn about $12 million for his role on the show this season, but will not receive credit as an executive producer. He will, however, have creative consultation and approval on judges and other production issues, Variety has confirmed. Sources say the negotiations were protracted due to questions about his complicated schedule and other commitments.\n\nSeacrest served as host for the franchise during its 15-season run on Fox, which aired its \u201cfarewell season\u201d last year. The multihyphenate will continue to co-host and executive produce \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan\u201d from New York in addition to hosting and executive producing his iHeartRadio-syndicated morning radio show \u201cOn Air With Ryan Seacrest\u201d from Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to put into words what \u2018American Idol\u2019 means to me,\u201d Seacrest said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it\u2019s allowed me to experience. It\u2019s been an incredible journey from day one. To be asked to return this year, at my new home at Disney|ABC, is an honor, if not a bit surreal. I believe ABC is the perfect home for \u2018Idol,\u2019 and I\u2019ve every confidence the show\u2019s legions of fans will love it \u2014 especially \u201cIdol\u2019s\u201d best traditions of showcasing heartwarming stories, remarkable talent discovery, and, best of all, making dreams come true.\u201d\n\nABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said she attributes much of \u201cAmerican Idol\u2019s\u201d success to Seacrest.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to be ushering in this new era of \u2018American Idol\u2019 with Ryan at the helm,\u201d Dungey said. \u201cSo much of \u201cAmerican Idol\u2019s\u201d overwhelming success can be attributed to Ryan, whose larger-than- life personality and laudable dedication to creating quality entertainment has made him a true master of his craft. His talent is limitless, and I can\u2019t think of a more appropriate person to honor the \u2018Idol\u2019 legacy as it takes on new life than the man who has been there through it all.\u201d\n\nVariety reported in May that ABC, which beat out other networks to bring the singing competition back to the air, committed to broadcasting about 40 hours of the program \u2014 making it likely that the show will air over two nights most weeks, like it did on Fox.\n\nKaty Perry joined \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d as a judge in May, becoming the first onscreen talent to board the reboot.\n\nLive auditions for the reality series begin in August. The show returns on ABC in 2018.\n\n\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d is produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, a division of CORE Media Group. The executive producers include FremantleMedia North America\u2019s Trish Kinane and Jennifer Mullin, along with co-executive producer Megan Wolflick. FremantleMedia International distributes the series worldwide.\n\n\u201c\u2018Idol\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be \u2018Idol\u2019 without Ryan,\u201d said Core Media Group CEO Peter Hurwitz. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that he\u2019s joining us and ABC as we set out to uncover the amazing talent America has to offer,\u201d added Kinane, FremantleMedia\u2019s president of entertainment programming.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ryan-seacrest-american-idol.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fryan-seacrest-hosting-american-idol-revival-1202501251%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202501251&comment_count=10", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ryan-seacrest-american-idol.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maane Khatchatourian"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-hosting-american-idol-revival-1202501251/", "title": "Ryan Seacrest Returning to Host \u2018American Idol\u2019 Revival", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "After months of talks and speculation, Ryan Seacrest will officially return to host the \"American Idol\" revival on ABC.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202501251, "author": "Maane Khatchatourian", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-07-20T06:23:32"}, "pmc-tag": "American Idol,Ryan Seacrest", "title": "Ryan Seacrest Returning to Host \u2018American Idol\u2019 Revival", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music,tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ryan Seacrest Returning to Host \u2018American Idol\u2019 Revival", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-hosting-american-idol-revival-1202501251/", "description": "Seacrest \u2026 in!
