{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/big-little-lies-season-2-details", "text": "Ask and you shall receive: After a swarm of messages from fans demanding it, HBO announced Big Little Lies is officially returning for a second season. It makes total sense why the network wants to continue this franchise. For one, people loved it: The season-one finale brought in a whopping 1.9 million viewers, which is huge for premium cable. It was also a critical favorite, scoring big at both the Emmy and Golden Globe awards. Will lightning strike twice, though? Based on what HBO has released about season two, it seems like yes. The brand has all the ingredients to make a phenomenal second season (including Meryl Streep).\n\nUntil then, here's everything we know about Big Little Lies season two. Fair warning: Season one spoilers ahead!\n\nIt will premiere on June, 9 2019. Let the countdown begin.\n\nThe first full-length trailer looks amazing. It dropped on Friday, May 10. Check it out for yourself, below:\n\nAnd here's the other teaser for the season. Released on April 14.\n\nAll of the original cast is returning. Originally HBO had confirmed only Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman. In a press release issued later, the network said most of season one's cast is expected to return. All of the original actresses are said to be receiving significant pay bumps, as well.\n\n\"We all said goodbye at the end, but we became very close and had such a good time doing it, and the desire to spend more time together was a huge part of it,\" Kidman said at the February TCA panel. \"But there was an enormous demand from the audience. I\u2019ve never been in something that reached so far, and that was such a compelling idea in terms of putting it together again.\u201d\n\nDavid E. Kelley, the screenwriter behind season one, is coming back\u2014and he'll write all seven scripts for season two. \"Going back to last season, we didn\u2019t really close the chapter,\" Kelley said at the TCA panel. \"It ended on an open note. What will happen to these relationships, friendships, marriage? Everybody up here can get jobs\u2014we didn\u2019t want to do this unless we could at least have a fair shot of living up to the bar that we had set in year one. We met and talked about what the stories were and were very candid about what was viable and which stories were not good enough. We didn\u2019t agree to set sail until we agreed this was storytelling we felt passionate about.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c51e5c49dee4f2d49524845/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/TCDHATA_EC103.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1548777466/glamour_salaries-10.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5cd2e08cf100f9175747b293/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1142164436.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c5b3c20b4d3072ceb0b3f43/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/emilia-clarke-kit-harington-got.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros", "Julyssa Lope", "Jessica Radlof", "Natasha Red"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/big-little-lies-season-2-details", "title": "Big Little Lies Season 2: Everything We Know So Far", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "From Meryl Streep's casting decision to the writer and director of the series, here's everything we know about \"Big Little Lies\" season two.", "id": "5a78d0556a41a70bc017a5cf", "keywords": "tv,meryl streep,big little lies", "news_keywords": "tv,meryl streep,big little lies", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a78d0556a41a70bc017a5cf", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"From Meryl Streep's casting decision to the writer and director of the series, here's everything we know about \\\"Big Little Lies\\\" season two.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "BRB, watching this on loop forever.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "This New Trailer for 'Big Little Lies' Season 2 Is Explosive", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/big-little-lies-season-2-details"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "BRB, watching this on loop forever.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "This New Trailer for 'Big Little Lies' Season 2 Is Explosive"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
