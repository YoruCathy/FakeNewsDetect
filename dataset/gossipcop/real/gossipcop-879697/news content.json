She\u2019s been giving speeches, sitting on panels, going to the theater, and taking selfies with supporters, and this fall, she\u2019ll be publishing a book that promises to be \u201cher most personal memoir yet,\u201d according to her publisher, Simon & Schuster.\n\nThe book, titled \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d will offer an intimate view of what it was like for Mrs. Clinton to run as the first female presidential candidate from a major party in United States history, in an often vicious and turbulent campaign.\n\nImage\n\nMs. Clinton will explore the mistakes she made, what it was like to run against Donald J. Trump, the difficulties she has faced as a woman in politics, the role that Russian hacking played in the election, and how she recovered from the humiliating loss, according to a description of the book released by Simon & Schuster.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/28clintonbook-web/28clintonbook-web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/books/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened.html", "title": "New Details From Hillary Clinton\u2019s Memoir Revealed", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-07-27T16:54:42.000Z", "modified": "2017-07-27T16:54:39.000Z", "section": "Books", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexandra-alter", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005313390, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/0805bf98-78c1-5f85-a6e8-400e100e0ec6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/67766794fc9f459ba19c187d14cdad34", "description": "\u201cWhat Happened,\u201d a forthcoming memoir by Hillary Clinton, promises to be a candid account of what the 2016 election was like for her.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Alexandra Alter", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Books,What Happened,Hillary Clinton,2016 Presidential Election,Donald Trump,US Politics", "pdate": 20170727, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/books/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened.html", "type": "article", "title": "New Details From Hillary Clinton\u2019s Memoir Revealed", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at a fund-raiser in June. \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d her new memoir, promises to be a candid account of what the 2016 election was like for her."}, "description": "\u201cWhat Happened,\u201d a forthcoming memoir by Hillary Clinton, promises to be a candid account of what the 2016 election was like for her."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/books/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened.html", "title": "New Details From Hillary Clinton\u2019s Memoir Revealed", "description": "\u201cWhat Happened,\u201d a forthcoming memoir by Hillary Clinton, promises to be a candid account of what the 2016 election was like for her.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/arts/7clintonbook2-web/7clintonbook2-web-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "The former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at a fund-raiser in June. \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d her new memoir, promises to be a candid account of what the 2016 election was like for her."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/0805bf98-78c1-5f85-a6e8-400e100e0ec6"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "books", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/books/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/0805bf98-78c1-5f85-a6e8-400e100e0ec6", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/books/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/books/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501084800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
