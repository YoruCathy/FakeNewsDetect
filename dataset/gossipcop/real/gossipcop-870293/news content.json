I was pulled away, I didn\u2019t see any more,\u201d D\u2019Amico said.\n\nThe shooter, 27-year-old serial killer Andrew Cunanan, offed himself with the same gun shortly after, and his motive remains a mystery \u2014 leading to decades of speculation and, D\u2019Amico says, fake news.\n\n\u201cThere has been so much written and said about the murder, and thousands of suppositions, but not a trace of reality,\u201d he told The Guardian.\n\nIn another scene, Versace, played by Edgar Ramirez, freaks out when he thinks the paparazzi have caught the pair touching \u2014 but D\u2019Amico said he was very open about his sexuality, even before he came out in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWe lived like a natural couple, there was never a problem,\u201d said D\u2019Amico, a fashion designer himself who received a monthly stipend of $30,555 for life in Versace\u2019s will.\n\nD\u2019Amico says he wasn\u2019t consulted on the Ryan Murphy-produced \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace,\u201d and doesn\u2019t plan on watching it when it screens next year.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ricky_martin.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ricky_martin.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ricky_martin.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/07/30/gianni-versaces-lover-slams-ricky-martins-ridiculous-portrayal/", "title": "Gianni Versace\u2019s lover slams Ricky Martin\u2019s \u2018ridiculous\u2019 portrayal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
