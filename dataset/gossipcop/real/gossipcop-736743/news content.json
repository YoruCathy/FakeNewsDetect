It was, like, a normal life.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThat '70s Show,\u201d their characters shared an on-and-off romantic relationship. Nothing came of it in reality as Kutcher wed actress Demi Moore near the show\u2019s final season.\n\nKutcher and Moore split in 2011 and Kunis\u2019 romantic interest began soon after.\n\n\u201cI was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back,\u201d she said of the time she saw him at a 2012 awards show. \u201cI was literally like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s kinda hot.\u2019 And then he turned around, and I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s Kutch.\u2019 I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.\u201d\n\nCharacteristically, it all began with no strings attached, she said.\n\n\u201cWe lived our movies out, where we were like, \u2018Let\u2019s just hook up. Let\u2019s have fun. We\u2019re both single. We both trust each other. Everything\u2019s great.\u2019 None of us wanted tension,\u201d Kunis told Maron.\n\nKunis could only bear their friends with benefits relationship for only so long, however.\n\n\u201cWe hooked up for three months. And just like our movies, one of us caught feelings.\u201d\n\nKunis\u2019 reaction when Kutcher told her about someone he was dating was the tell-tale sign she wanted them to be something more she said.\n\n\u201cI felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,\u201d Kunis said. \u201cI was like \u2026 \u2018Oh, my God. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so I\u2019m going to speak up.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs we now know, Kutcher felt the same way; he asked her to move in the next day, Kunis said.\n\nIt has been all uphill from there.\n\nThe couple welcomed their daughter Wyatt in October 2014, got married in July 2015 and welcomed son Dimitri in November 2016.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ronnie-wood-mick-jagger-keith-richards-rolling-stones.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20110019543582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/demi20moore20mila20kunis20ashton20kutcher20getty20AP.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/demi20moore20mila20kunis20ashton20kutcher20getty20AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/demi20moore20mila20kunis20ashton20kutcher20getty20AP.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jack Wisniewski"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mila-kunis-says-ashton-kutchers-marriage-to-demi-moore-was-normal", "title": "Mila Kunis says Ashton Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore was 'normal'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher started with \"No Strings Attatched.\"", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Jack Wisniewski", "dc.title": "Mila Kunis says Ashton Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore was 'normal'", "dcterms.abstract": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher started with \"No Strings Attatched.\"", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher started with \"No Strings Attatched.\"", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:80f9c301-c4b0-5778-9f5d-7c62be44c703", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-07-30", "dcterms.created": "2018-07-30T13:42:04-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-07-30T15:03:57-04:00", "og": {"title": "Mila Kunis says Ashton Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore was 'normal'", "description": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher started with \"No Strings Attatched.\"", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/demi20moore20mila20kunis20ashton20kutcher20getty20AP.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mila-kunis-says-ashton-kutchers-marriage-to-demi-moore-was-normal", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Mila Kunis says Ashton Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore was 'normal'", "description": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher started with \"No Strings Attatched.\"", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/demi20moore20mila20kunis20ashton20kutcher20getty20AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mila-kunis-says-ashton-kutchers-marriage-to-demi-moore-was-normal"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Couples,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT,/FOX NEWS/SPECIAL/Campus", "classification-isa": "couples,entertainment,campus"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
