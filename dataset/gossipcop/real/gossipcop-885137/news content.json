But in the sixth episode, she received a new diagnosis: borderline personality disorder (BPD).\n\n\u201cWe wrote her kind of by feel for a while,\u201d explains executive producer Aline Brosh McKenna. \u201cWe kind of wrote her behavior in a way that felt right to us for about a season and a half, and then Rachel and I started to realize this was an area we were going into. It\u2019s funny, we were trying to help Rebecca, so we were trying to figure out what was best for her. And when we looked into it, so much of this seemed to resonate.\u201d\n\nAfter attempting to commit suicide, Rebecca was admitted to a hospital where her doctors discovered that she ticked more than just the five items on the BPD checklist necessary for the diagnosis.\n\nIn fact, when McKenna was researching the disorder, she realized that not only did Rebecca exhibit all nine of the items on the list, but in their 36 episodes, they had about 10 examples of each of the nine symptoms.\n\n\u201cNo diagnosis is a perfect diagnosis, and it\u2019s a bit imprecise, and there are many schools of thought on BPD, but we tried to dial in on what we thought was accurate for her,\u201d McKenna says.\n\nRebecca was initially excited to learn her previous diagnoses were inaccurate, which led to a musical number about finding her \u201ctribe\u201d and understanding what was wrong so it could be fixed. But when she received the actual diagnosis, her tune changed because she thought it meant she was \u201cbroken\u201d and would not be able to be fixed after all.\n\n\u201cThere are a whole host of behaviors that are deeply rooted in her, so she\u2019ll continue to struggle \u2014 but she\u2019ll struggle with more information,\u201d McKenna says.\n\nNow that she has an official diagnosis, that struggle will be \u201cto include her new truths about herself into her daily life,\u201d says McKenna, as well as to learn new strategies to try and get better. For Rebecca, the path will be \u201cintensive\u201d therapy, which the show will explore in upcoming episodes through group therapy sessions.\n\n\u201cMainly it\u2019s a lot of hard work, and it\u2019s really challenging, and the people who do that hard work are very brave,\u201d McKenna says. \u201cJust because she has a name for it, it doesn\u2019t mean her behavior\u2019s going to be different. In many ways, it kind of enhances her struggle, it makes it harder. Because now when she\u2019s doing things, she knows why, and that makes her confused and angry. And there\u2019s a lot with mental health stuff [that\u2019s] one step forward and two steps back. She\u2019s not always diligent about it, but we really see her going forward, doing the work. She really is an A-student, so when she has an assignment she really takes it on.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the episode, Rebecca also finally acknowledged that her ex Josh (Vincent Rodriguez III) was not the cause of her problems.\n\n\u201cFor Rebecca, love is her drug of choice,\u201d McKenna says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very dangerous substance, but like food, you need to have it. So she has to learn how to get love in her life in a healthy way, which is obviously very challenging for her. And if she messes up with that going forward, it has possible serious consequences for her.\u201d\n\nAs Rebecca struggles to come to terms with her diagnosis (\u201cIs that who I am? How do I live within that? What choices do I make now?\u201d says McKenna) she isn\u2019t the only one who is going to have to do some hard work to understand their own psychology. Nathaniel (Scott Michael Foster) finally got a glimpse into his family\u2019s history when he learned his mother overdosed on sleeping pills when he was a child. Despite that backstory, McKenna says, it won\u2019t always be easy for him to see what Rebecca is going through.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of unresolved pain in his past,\u201d McKenna says. \u201cIt sets him on the most serious of the journeys.\u201d\n\nJosh, too, must figure out who he is and what he wants his life to be without a relationship with Rebecca.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is really interesting is that Josh had connected to her because he was struggling with his own identity and failing in New York, and here\u2019s this smart, cosmopolitan, charming, beautiful girl that loves [him] and makes [him] feel special,\u201d McKenna says. \u201cOf course the audience has always known that it had nothing to do with him \u2013 he was just kind of conveniently placed \u2013 but he didn\u2019t know that. He thought she loved him, and that made him feel great. He really starts to have his quarter-life crisis now. He is now unemployed, he doesn\u2019t have a place to live, he doesn\u2019t have her anymore, he\u2019s not seeing anyone. It\u2019s tough stuff coming up for Josh.\u201d\n\nThe season may have started off as a revenge tale, but it has grown into something much more complicated. That\u2019s why, although McKenna originally considered the \u201cScary Scary Sexy Lady\u201d song as a new opening credits sequence, they ultimately went with \u201cCrazy\u201d instead. And similarly, McKenna admits that \u201cthere\u2019s a change in the names in the episode titles coming up\u201d to cover the new themes \u2013 and really, new Rebecca \u2013 with which the show is now dealing.\n\n\u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d airs on Fridays at 8 p.m. on the CW.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif",
