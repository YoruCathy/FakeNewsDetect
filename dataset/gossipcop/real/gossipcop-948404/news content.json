Then then-mom-to-be captioned a belly-baring selfie, \u201c40 weeks. The end is a real mind F. Everyone keeps asking \u2014 are you excited? 100% YES, but also no. Turns out it\u2019s real hard when you don\u2019t know what you are in for this first time around.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cSocial media can mess with you too. Everyone so in love with these cute AF babies while I\u2019m just feeling huge and really anxious wondering what will this love feel like? And am I the only one who is scared about how our life is going to change? Torn between wanting to do everything in my control to get prepared, but also want to move slowly. Trying to relax.\u201d\n\n\u201cA huge gift in all of this is that I have never loved or respected my body more even though I have never felt bigger, bumpier and lumpier,\u201d she reflected. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t forget this newfound self confidence as life and routine creep back in. I am going to miss this bump of love and quite frankly the things I can get away with because \u2018I\u2019m pregnant\u2019. Turns out people are really REALLY nice to you, especially at the end.\u201d\n\nCole concluded, \u201cAnyway, I am cherishing these last moments before I have to share you with this wild world. The real work starts when you get here, little one and I\u2019m all yours.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kristin Cavallari Reveals the Only Two Laguna Beach Alums She Follows on Instagram\n\nCole and Simshauser tied the knot in 2015 at the La Quinta Resort & Club in La Quinta, California \u2014 with her Laguna Beach pals Alex Murrel and Morgan Souders as bridesmaids.
