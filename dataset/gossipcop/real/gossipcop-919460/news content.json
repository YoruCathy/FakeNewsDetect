A Jedi craves not these things.\n\nBut a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ain\u2019t bad.\n\nMark Hamill, the legendary actor who portrayed Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars saga \u2014 and whose incredible body of work spans movies, TV, theatre, video games, and voice-over \u2014 received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today, which has been dubbed #JediDay. The accolade was dedicated in a ceremony at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, featuring Star Wars creator George Lucas and fellow Star Wars icon Harrison Ford, who delivered fun and touching tributes to their friend and collaborator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of Mark for getting this star,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way from that [Star Wars] casting session\u2026to getting your star on Hollywood Boulevard.\u201d\n\nIn preparing for the event, Ford went back and watched their original screen test. \u201cHe had just the right blend of youthfulness and enthusiasm,\u201d he said. Continuing, Ford expressed his joy for Hamill. \u201cHe is, as he always was, a quiet, sincere, honest person\u2026I\u2019m happy for ya, pal.\u201d\n\nFinally, Hamill addressed the many fans in attendance. \u201cWords truly fail me. It\u2019s hard to convey my gratitude, my joy, the exhilaration of being recognized this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been this speechless since The Force Awakens.\u201d Hamill thanked Lucas, Ford, Disney, and his family, and recounted his journey from childhood puppet shows to working actor. But he saved a special tribute for the Star Wars faithful.\n\n\u201cYou are with me through thick and thin, and the highs and lows, and everywhere in between,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom Jedi to Joker and back again, it\u2019s been a fantastic ride. Thank you so much, and may the Force be with each and every one of you.\u201d\n\nHamill receives his star as Star Wars: The Last Jedi arrives on Digital on March 13, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and On-Demand on March 27.\n\nCheck out photos from the ceremony below!
