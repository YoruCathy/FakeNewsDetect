So I go back to the doctors and say, \u2018Look, they\u2019re too big,\u2019 [and they say] \u2018Great, we\u2019ll take them out and make your implants smaller.\u2019 Within six months, the implants started slipping through the mesh. And now the implants are down to the bottom of my rib cage.\u201d\n\nNow Kitaen wants them out entirely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual for an actress/entertainment-type person to not want to have implants anymore, but after a certain amount of time, you\u2019re fed up with implants and the complications associated with them,\u201d Dr. Terry Dubrow says. \u201cSo I applaud Tawny for wanting to get rid of them.\u201d\n\nDubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif take Kitaen back to the examination room to see what they can do.\n\n\u201cThere is truly a lot hanging on this exam,\u201d Kitaen says. \u201cMe getting my life back, me getting back into life, me being happy. If Dr. Dubrow throws his hands in the air right now I\u2019d be absolutely devastated.\u201d\n\nBotched airs Thursdays at 9/8c on E!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Ftawny-kitaen-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Ftawny-kitaen-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/bodies/tawny-kitaen-breast-implants-removed/", "title": "Actress Tawny Kitaen Wants Her Breast Implants Out: They're 'Down to the Bottom of My Rib Cage'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bodies,Bodies News,Celebrity Bodies,News,Plastic Surgery,Tawny Kitaen,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Bodies,Bodies News,Celebrity Bodies,News,Plastic Surgery,Tawny Kitaen,TV Watch", "description": "Actress Tawny Kitaen asks the Botched doctors to remove an oversized pair of breast implants that are hanging at the bottom of her rib cage", "og": {"title": "Actress Tawny Kitaen Wants Her Breast Implants Out: They're 'Down to the Bottom of My Rib Cage'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/tawny-kitaen-breast-implants-removed/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DidY7Un8XoY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent At the height of her career in the 80s, actress Tawny Kitaen wanted bigger breasts. \u201cIt must have been something inside of myself where&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Ftawny-kitaen-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/bodies/tawny-kitaen-breast-implants-removed/", "description": "Actress Tawny Kitaen asks the Botched doctors to remove an oversized pair of breast implants that are hanging at the bottom of her rib cage", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Ftawny-kitaen-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/tawny-kitaen-breast-implants-removed/", "title": "Actress Tawny Kitaen Wants Her Breast Implants Out: They're 'Down to the Bottom of My Rib Cage'", "description": "Actress Tawny Kitaen asks the Botched doctors to remove an oversized pair of breast implants that are hanging at the bottom of her rib cage", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Ftawny-kitaen-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DidY7Un8XoY"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
