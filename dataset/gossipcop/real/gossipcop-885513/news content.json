This week, Universal Pictures announced they are releasing the next installment of the franchise in 2020, one year later than initially planned.\n\nOne day later, the studio again revealed a new spin-off movie would hit theaters starring Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and Jason Statham. The film hits theaters in two years, 2019.\n\nAs you may already know, this angered Tyrese Gibson, who took to Instagram several times to blame Dwayne for the delay of the movie.\n\nJust a few days before Tyrese\u2019s ex-wife accused him of child abuse, the actor used his social media account to insult Dwayne\u2019s role in Baywatch while simultaneously stating the actor made the franchise \u201call about him.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vin appears to be unfazed by all of the drama; he wrote on his Instagram page, \u201cBrotherhood\u2026and all its complexities.\u201dHe added, \u201cthis scene was filmed in Puerto Rico. I can remember it like it was yesterday. Such a beautiful island.\u201d\n\nAccording to the leading star of the series, a woman on Facebook requested that he work with \u201cThe Rock,\u201d and Vin \u201clistened to her request and he became Hobbs.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Vin said it\u2019s not \u201canyone\u2019s fault,\u201d when referring to the rescheduling of the ninth movie of the series. Diesel added that like any well-used vehicle, the franchise requires maintenance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy good friend and the godfather of Universal, Ron Meyer, has granted me the time to do just that.\u201d As for the former-wrestler-turned-actor, Dwayne Johnson, in recent years, has worked hard to make himself one of the highest paid actors in the world. In fact, he comes in at number 2 on Forbes 2017 list just after Mark Wahlberg. Fans of \u201cThe Rock\u201d will remember his rise to fame as a professional wrestler where his famous saying was, \u201cCan you smell what \u201cThe Rock\u201d is cooking?\u201d", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun_-Maverick-James-Bond-And-More-Get-New-Release-Dates-After-Being-Postponed-Due-To-COVID-19-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Harvey-Weinstein-The-Daily-Beast-1-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fast-and-Furious-9-ScreenGeek.net--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dwayne-Johnson-UnknownMale.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vin-Diesel-Vulture-1-1-e1507401761604.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vin-Diesel-Vulture-1-1-e1507401761604.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/vin-diesel-talks-fast-and-furious-9-drama-74343/", "title": "Vin Diesel Talks Fast And Furious 9 Drama", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "dwayne johnson, fast and furious, tyrese gibson, vin diesel,", "keywords": "celebrity news, dwayne johnson, fast and furious, tyrese gibson, vin diesel,", "description": "Vin Diesel is trying to make things work between cast members of the Fast & Furious franchise.
