I think she needs to not take the whole Republican world on her shoulders. It\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cYou\u2019re not the Republican voice. It makes you stressed, it makes you tense. I think being able to just lighten up a little.\u201d\n\nThe conservative co-host appeared on the same show Wednesday and shared with Cohen that Shepherd\u2019s words didn\u2019t sit well with her.\n\n\u201cI was super bummed out when I saw her saying that,\u201d McCain said. \u201cShe said I need to lighten up. You know, \u2018The View,\u2019 it\u2019s a tough show that\u2019s really politically heavy. We\u2019re a news show now. It\u2019s not the show that she once hosted. Right now, and not to make this too heavy, but in Trump\u2019s America, we should not be telling women to lighten up. It\u2019s a serious time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can take things seriously.\u201d\n\nMcCain shared similar sentiments on Twitter, to which Shepherd replied, \u201cMy response to @Andy on #WWHL wasn\u2019t intended to be anything but constructive. We have talked at length privately & I\u2019ve been nothing but supportive of you & everyone who has co-hosted @TheView -If I came across as not being supportive of you, that wasn\u2019t my intent.\u201d", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meghan-mccain-sherri-shepherd.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meghan-mccain-sherri-shepherd.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meghan-mccain-sherri-shepherd.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/07/26/meghan-mccain-bummed-out-by-sherri-shepherd-telling-her-to-lighten-up/", "title": "Meghan McCain \u2018bummed out\u2019 by Sherri Shepherd telling her to \u2018lighten up\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
