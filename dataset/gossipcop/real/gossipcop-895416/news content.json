And, when she is joined by Sofia Vergara, you know that it has to be just plain hilarious!\n\nIn a recent video posted by Ellen DeGeneres, we see a funny stint between the two where Ellen is trying to teach Sofia a few English words. Because Vergara is already fluent in Spanish, DeGeneres thought it would be fun to teach her a word of the day in English.\n\nDeGeneres tried to stump Vergara with the word \"flabbergasted.\" However, the actress pronounced it perfectly. It wasn't until DeGeneres asked her to say the word \"discombobulated\" that Vergara got a little tongue-tied.\n\n\"It's not even a word. You're just trying to ruin my reputation,\" she told the host after butchering her first attempts.\n\nThankfully, Vergara was a good sport about the whole thing and laughed throughout the experience. In the end, she pronounced the word correctly\u2014almost.\n\nWatch the video to see her say \"discombobulated.\"\n\nThe actress appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, airing Tuesday, and talked about celebrating their two-year wedding anniversary today. Vergara and Manganiello tied the knot on Nov. 22, 2015 with a lavish ceremony in Florida.\n\n\"I'm very lucky,\" Vergara told DeGeneres about her marriage. \"I must have done something really right in my life to get that reward.\"\n\nWhen DeGeneres remarked that the Modern Family star is a good person, Vergara cracked, \"I'm good but I'm not a very, very good person. But, he's better than me.\"\n\nIsn\u2019t that awwdorable?", "images": ["https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/c_footerfb.svg", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/c_tnplaceholder.png?tr=w-600,h-450", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_movies_now_logo.png", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_mrnowlogo.jpg", "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/zoom/story/1513190586-maxresdefault_6_1.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_et_logo.png", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/d_footer-insta.svg", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/d_apple.svg", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_timesnow_logo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=781440862041802&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/c_zoomlogo.png", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/d_footer-twitter.svg", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/d_android.svg", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/c_searchblack.svg", "https://trc.taboola.com/timesnow-timesnow-sc/log/3/action?name=TimesNowpage_view&item-url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesnownews.com%2F", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=26200502&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_timesnetwork.png", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_mn_plus_logo.png", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/c_timesmobile.png", "https://trc.taboola.com/1121229/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_mnx_logo.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/853549987/?guid=ON&script=0", "https://iks.timesnownews.com/s/v1/img/logo/d_romedynow_logo.png"], "top_img": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/zoom/story/1513190586-maxresdefault_6_1.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/international-news/article/sofia-vergara-english-words-pronunciation-ellen-degeneres-cute-hilarious-video/161267", "title": "Sofia Vergara trying to pronounce an English word is the best thing you'll see today", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/international-news/article/sofia-vergara-english-words-pronunciation-ellen-degeneres-cute-hilarious-video/161267", "type": "Article", "title": "Sofia Vergara trying to pronounce an English word is the best thing you'll see today", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/zoom/story/1513190586-maxresdefault_6_1.jpg?tr=w-560,h-292,fo-top"}, "keywords": "sofia vergara, sofia vergra english words, ellen degeneres, ellen degeneres", "fb": {"app_id": 2051731518430427, "pages": 218735715310}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sofia Vergara trying to pronounce an English word is the best thing you'll see today", "image": "https://imgk.timesnownews.com/zoom/story/1513190586-maxresdefault_6_1.jpg", "site": "@TIMESNOW", "creator": "@TIMESNOW"}, "expires": "2017-11-29T20:28:00+05:30", "theme-color": "#254A96", "robots": "noindex"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4sU_AhRPY0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.timesnownews.com", "summary": ""}
