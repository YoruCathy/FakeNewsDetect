Here's what we learned.\n\nRidley is so pro-porgs (Rey not so much).\n\nThe free world fell in love when the chubby porgs creatures made a screaming debut in The Last Jedi trailer last month. It hit Ridley, too. She lists a porgs toy as one of her prized possessions.\n\n\"It\u2019s bringing a lot of pleasure right now,\" says Ridley, calling the character \"adorable\" and \"hilarious.\"\n\nMore:Daisy Ridley leaps from 'Star Wars' to force awakening in 'Murder on the Orient Express'\n\nAnd:Daisy Ridley leaps from 'Star Wars' to force awakening in 'Murder on the Orient Express'\n\nThe love affair started on set with the goofy looking puppet, operated by the same crew who handle droid BB-8. \"It\u2019s wonderful to be working around practical things on set that have such personality,\" says Ridley,\n\nBut Rey won't fall for the creature's charms. \"Rey, honestly, is too wrapped up in her own journey to pay attention to porgs,\" says Ridley. \"Which is a sad thing.\"\n\nSnoke will provide the worst kind of 'test' for Rey.\n\nSupreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) ain't pretty and acts worse. \"He looks mental. Snoke is an evil guy, if you can call him a guy,\" says Ridley.\n\nLast Jedi's trailer shows Rey screaming under Snoke torture. Ridley says the torture scenes were long enough to leave her hoarse. \"It was painful. My throat hurt after that one,\" says Ridley.\n\n\"Snoke is one of those tests for Rey,\" she adds. \"And when I say testing, it's the worst use of testing ever.\"\n\nWatch for Kylo Ren and Rey time.\n\nIs there something special going on with Rey and the Dark Side-dwelling Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? The two seem to have a special connection in the trailers.\n\nRidley choses her words carefully.\n\n\"These are two people who represent two very different sides of life, good and evil,\" she says. \"That's going to be explored more in this.\"\n\nLuke Skywalker is annoyed with Rey.\n\nRey is expecting Luke Skywalker to be thrilled to get his lightsaber back in Last Jedi. But he's not happy to see her. \"She thinks there\u2019s going to be a warm welcome. But Luke went to this island to get away and he doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed,\" says Ridley.\n\nDon't fret. Skywalker takes \"a tremendous journey from the beginning of the relationship to ultimately where they end up in the film.\" Our personal theory: He had coffee.\n\nJudi Dench really doesn't know squat about Star Wars.\n\nDench seems to be a Star Wars nut, grilling Ridley in one of Gad's videos on fan-minutia such as whether she had been tested for midi-chlorians, living cells in tune with the Force (from Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace).\n\nShe played the part well, but Dench doesn't have Force fever.\n\n\"She was like, 'Medi...Midi-chlorians, what is that?' Josh and I had to explain,\" says Ridley, who says she had Gad had to stifle their laughs when cameras rolled.\n\nDench did ask Ridley to shoot a personal Star Wars video for her grandson. \"Obviously he's very interested.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5994083ec2df4f8ebebca3d633485033b17daeec/c=704-0-3741-1716/local/-/media/2017/11/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636458775045685049-EP8-FF-003817.jpg?width=3037&height=1716&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5646619199001_5645067020001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5994083ec2df4f8ebebca3d633485033b17daeec/c=704-0-3741-1716/local/-/media/2017/11/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636458775045685049-EP8-FF-003817.jpg?width=3037&height=1716&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/11/14/daisy-ridley-porgs-kylo-ren-and-more-star-war-last-jedi-teasers/851353001/", "title": "Daisy Ridley on porgs, Kylo Ren and more 'Star War: The Last Jedi' teasers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Daisy Ridley on porgs, Kylo Ren and more 'Star War: The Last Jedi' teasers", "description": "The 'Murder on the Orient Express' star gave a peek into her next journey as Rey in 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi.'", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/11/14/daisy-ridley-porgs-kylo-ren-and-more-star-war-last-jedi-teasers/851353001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5994083ec2df4f8ebebca3d633485033b17daeec/c=704-0-3741-1716/local/-/media/2017/11/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636458775045685049-EP8-FF-003817.jpg?width=3037&height=1716&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3037, "height": 1716}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bryan Alexander", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The 'Murder on the Orient Express' star gave a peek into her next journey as Rey in 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi.'", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5994083ec2df4f8ebebca3d633485033b17daeec/c=704-0-3741-1716/local/-/media/2017/11/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636458775045685049-EP8-FF-003817.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Daisy Ridley on porgs, Kylo Ren and more 'Star War: The Last Jedi' teasers", "description": "The 'Murder on the Orient Express' star gave a peek into her next journey as Rey in 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi.'"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510588800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
