Beachy waves are a great look for summer, and nearly every beauty brand has attempted to bottle the effects of the ocean so you can get the perfect summer hair\u2014at home!\n\nYour hair type influences what kind of products will get you perfect beachy hair. If you have wavy hair, you just need a little texturizing spray to separate your hair and activate the wave.
