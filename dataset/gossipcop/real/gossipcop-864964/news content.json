I will not be returning to \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 when production starts next week. Though I made myself available to come back, CBS and I weren\u2019t able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue,\u201d the actor posted Wednesday morning on Facebook.\n\nLast week, Variety reported that Kim and his co-star Grace Park would be departing the CBS procedural ahead of its eighth season, due to a dispute with CBS Television Studios to reach pay equality with co-stars Alex O\u2019Loughlin and Scott Caan. Insiders said Kim and Park\u2019s final offer from the studio was 10-15% less than O\u2019Loughlin and Caan, who each also each have lucrative back end deals on the show.\n\nSince the announcement of the duo\u2019s departure, fans have been critical of CBS\u2019s failure to reach parity with the series\u2019 two Asian actors, while keeping two Caucasian stars on the show. The social media chatter comes after critics have targeted CBS for its lack of diverse leading roles for women and actors of color, in comparison to the other broadcast networks.\n\nIn Kim\u2019s Facebook message, the actor thanked his fans, while addressing Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem, specifically for Asian American actors.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cAs an Asian American actor, I know first-hand how difficult it is to find opportunities at all, let alone play a well developed, three dimensional character like Chin Ho. I will miss him sincerely. What made him even more special is that he was a representative of a place my family and I so dearly love. It has been nothing short of an honor to be able to showcase the beauty and people of Hawaii every week, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder to call these islands home. To my local community, mahalo nui loa.\u201d\n\nHe continued to write, \u201cI\u2019ll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture. The path to equality is rarely easy. But I hope you can be excited for the future. I am.\u201d\n\nKim has starred on \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d as Chin Ho Kelly since the drama\u2019s debut in 2010 and was a series regular for seven seasons. Prior to the CBS series, he became known to television audiences for his starring role on \u201cLost.\u201d While he won\u2019t be returning to the small screen this upcoming TV season, Kim\u2019s production company, 3AD, has its first major series coming up with \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d on ABC on which he\u2019ll serve as an executive producer.\n\nRead Daniel Dae Kim\u2019s full Facebook
