Classics should stay just that. But does anyone ever listen? No, no they don\u2019t.\n\nThere are a few rare occasions where taking a film to television has worked \u2013 take last year\u2019s live televised version of Grease starring Vanessa Hudgens and Julianne Hough, for example. But last night\u2019s take on the Patrick Swayze favourite Dirty Dancing, went down like a lead balloon \u2013 or should we say, a very heavy watermelon.\n\nIt had all the trappings of a new classic in the making: an all-star cast including Nicole Scherzinger, Debra Messing and Abigail Breslin, all the old hits, and even the iconic lift between Baby and Johnny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story follows Breslin as Baby and newcomer Colt Prattes as Johnny as they fall in love at a Catskills resort where she is vacationing with her family. The routines were choreographed by the man responsible for the moves in the critically acclaimed Broadway musical Hamilton, but alas even the big dance finale wasn\u2019t enough to get people rooting for these two lovebirds.\n\nDebra Messing plays Baby\u2019s mother, Marjorie Housman (Picture: ABC)\n\nIn an interview with Messing, who plays Baby\u2019s mother Marjorie Houseman, she promised that this iteration of the eighties classic would be bigger and better, \u2018so there is a lot more music and there is a lot more dancing.\u2019\n\nBut unfortunately the ABC remake fell flat with viewers, who said they needed a helpline after watching the new version after it was broadcast on Channel 5.\n\nPerhaps the best thing to come out of the remake is the plethora of memes, born from the viewers\u2019 hatred of their precious eighties classic being meddled with.\n\nTwitter user @HelenJRJG said \u2018The Dirty Dancing remake hurts. Even the watermelon has been downgraded #dirtydancing\u2019, whilst @okiepie123 lamented, \u2018Just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse. They sing #dirtydancing\u2019.\n\nI imagine this is Jennifer Grey's reaction on #Dirtydancing 2017 pic.twitter.com/Jz9dpRVAV6 \u2014 Jo Mitchell (@Missjojomitch) June 11, 2017\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbigail Breslin recently revealed that she cried after recreating the infamous lift with dance partner Prattes.\n\n\u2018I have this picture on my phone of when we finally did the lift, like me just sobbing into his arm,\u2019 Breslin told E! Online. \u2018It was the most incredible thing. It was really overwhelming.\u2019 People have, however, been quick to compare the lift of Breslin and the actress who portrayed the original Baby, Jennifer Grey.\n\nMORE: Debra Messing admits the Dirty Dancing remake reveals what happened to Baby and Johnny after that summer\n\nMORE: Nicole Scherzinger beams in make-up free selfie with Dirty Dancing co-stars Sarah Hyland and Debra Messing", "images": ["https://d17fy28x8ov4h8.cloudfront.net/190x/images/j/JL_Brandlines_Logo_Micro_Use_Blk_RGB-100px_9.png", "https://d3tsytm1wtjqo2.cloudfront.net/180x/images/c/currys_9.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png", "https://d17fy28x8ov4h8.cloudfront.net/190x/images/v/virgin-media_9.png", "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=1024%2C731&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6034964&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://d3tsytm1wtjqo2.cloudfront.net/images/media/72/n/nord_logo_square_1x_9.png", "https://d17fy28x8ov4h8.cloudfront.net/190x/images/w/Wickes-Logo_9.png", "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C459&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=1024%2C731&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pascale Day"], "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/13/it-hurts-my-feelings-viewers-rip-into-abigail-breslin-remake-of-dirty-dancing-6703842/", "title": "Dirty Dancing remake is slammed by viewers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1180&h=630&crop=1"}, "title": "Dirty Dancing remake is trashed by viewers", "description": "The premiere of the 2017 remake of Dirty Dancing, featuring Nicole Scherzinger and Abigail Breslin, was widely criticised after it aired on Channel 5.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "description": "The TV movie of the 1987 hit Dirty Dancing aired in the UK last night and was widely panned by critics.", "news_keywords": "abigail breslin, dirty dancing, dirty dancing 2017, dirty dancing remake, new dirty dancing, dirty dancing cast, remake of dirty dancing, dirty dancing songs, patrick swayze and jennifer grey,", "msvalidate.01": "11110DC8D42E74E13F24B3A18E7CFB8A", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "fb": {"pages": "117118184990145,427889824264313", "app_id": 176908729004638}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/13/it-hurts-my-feelings-viewers-rip-into-abigail-breslin-remake-of-dirty-dancing-6703842/?ia_markup=1"}, "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Metro", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-13 07:14:11", "sailthru.title": "\u2018It hurts my feelings\u2019: Viewers rip into Abigail Breslin remake of Dirty Dancing", "sailthru.tags": "abigail breslin, debra messing, nicole scherzinger", "sailthru.description": "The premiere of the 2017 remake of Dirty Dancing, featuring Nicole Scherzinger and Abigail Breslin, was widely criticised after it aired on Channel 5.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=150&h=150&crop=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=50&h=150&crop=1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "Dirty Dancing remake is trashed by viewers", "type": "article", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/13/it-hurts-my-feelings-viewers-rip-into-abigail-breslin-remake-of-dirty-dancing-6703842/", "description": "The premiere of the 2017 remake of Dirty Dancing, featuring Nicole Scherzinger and Abigail Breslin, was widely criticised after it aired on Channel 5.", "site_name": "Metro", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=1024%2C731&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dirtydancing.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=1024%2C731&ssl=1", "width": 1024, "height": 731}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Nicole Scherzinger", "published_time": "2017-06-13T07:14:11+0000", "modified_time": "2019-12-12T10:35:28+0000"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cropped-m-icon-black-9693.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497283200.0, "source": "https://metro.co.uk", "summary": ""}
