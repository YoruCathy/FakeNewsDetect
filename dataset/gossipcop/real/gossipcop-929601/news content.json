On Monday, the eldest Kardashian sister touched down in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly addressed Congress to discuss reforms to outdated federal cosmetics regulations. According to TMZ, Kardashian has teamed up with the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that does research and advocacy focused on corporate accountability and sustainable materials. The work trip is also reportedly being filmed for a future episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nKardashian documented her arrival in D.C. in an Instagram Story on Monday. The 39-year-old mom of three posted a video of her plane touching down, writing, \"Hi, Washington, D.C.,\" followed by a snap of a conference table spread with an EWG tote bag and cookbook, which she captioned, \"Meetings #beautymadebetter.\" According to the EWG website, the #BeautyMadeBetter tag is part of a movement for cosmetics safety reform: \"Current laws leave the federal government powerless to screen personal care products for chemicals that have been linked to cancer, harm to the reproductive system in both men and women, and severe allergies, among other health effects,\" the site reads.\n\nKardashian is taking a stand in support of the Personal Care Products Safety Act, a bill that was introduced in 2015 by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine). Not only would this bill set new health and safety standards for cosmetics and other personal care products, it would allow the Food & Drug Administration to regularly review the safety of various ingredients in these products, according to the EWG.\n\nKardashian has been outspoken in the past about her commitment to using only the safest, healthiest ingredients. Back when Kardashian Beauty products were available at the Kardashian sisters' DASH stores (R.I.P.) and other retailers, Kardashian stressed that her top priority was making sure these products were high-quality. \"Since we started putting together our makeup collection, Kardashian Beauty, I've been extra invested in our list of no-no ingredients. It's an ingredients blacklist that we don't allow into the products \u2014 no parabens, no sulfates,\" she told Into the Gloss in 2013. \"Being a mom, I have become really invested in that \u2014 I just feel like once I know something, I can't go backwards and pretend like I don't know it.\"\n\nRead more stories about cosmetic regulations and the beauty industry:\n\nReady for another cosmetics deep dive?
