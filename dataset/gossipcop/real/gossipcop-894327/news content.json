At times it\u2019s a burden to consider that your life is no longer just yours and it\u2019s not private.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cIt can be hard to know that you can\u2019t function in full-that anonymity is no longer a valid goal and that your actions and words, whether they\u2019re done on a red carpet or in the most intimate corners of your personal life, to know that those aren\u2019t fully yours anymore. That\u2019s a difficult realization to come to when it does hit you. It\u2019s severe but you grow and move on from that, and on balance, I take into consideration all of the incredible fortune I have being in this position.\u201d\n\nBut she certainly doesn\u2019t \u201cmind\u201d being called inspirational.\n\nWhen asked how she feels about being dubbed an inspiration, Heard said, \u201cHave you ever met a woman? I always tend to do things truthfully and do the right thing. All I strive for in life is never get the temptation to try to be popular, liked, accepted. It\u2019s never anywhere equal to the desire I have to live my life truthfully and with dignity and with pride. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that if I wasn\u2019t living honestly, so it was never tempting to me to live another way.\u201d\n\nBut the \u2018Rum Diary\u2019 star, who finalised her divorce from Johnny Depp, 54, earlier this year because of the alleged \u201cverbal and physical abuse\u201d she suffered from the hands of Johnny, revealed that her main goal in life is to make sure she never gets tempted by popularity.
