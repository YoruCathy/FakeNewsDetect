The actor lashes out at police, calling them obscene names, while screaming. Shia also repeats that he\u2019s \u2018an American\u2019 and claims President Trump hates police.\n\nAs we previously reported, Shia LaBeouf, 31, was arrested at a hotel in Savannah, GA, on July 8. Now, disturbing body camera footage shows the actor going off on a drunken tirade during his arrest. Shia begins screaming at a police officer, who he calls a \u201cf\u2013king b\u2013ch,\u201d and a \u201cdumb f\u2013k, among other negative things. He attempts to plead his case, that he was only asking for a cigarette, when he believes he was wrongfully arrested. Then, the actor goes off on a political rant, where he slams President Donald Trump, 71. Watch the wild footage, below. [Courtesy of TMZ]\n\n\u201cI have rights. I have rights. I\u2019m an American. You\u2019ve got me arrested in my hotel for doing what, sir? Yo, you really got these cuffs on me heavy bro,\u201d he says while being handcuffed by police. When the officer asks Shia if they can talk, the actor immediately declines. \u201cNo we can\u2019t,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a f\u2013king American. I pay my taxes. Get these sh-ts off my f\u2013king arms.\u201d The cop calmly asks, once again, if they can have a conversation, to which Shia says, \u201cNo. You\u2019re going to put these sh-ts off my arms, or you be f\u2013king f\u2013ked.\u201d\n\nAt this point in the body cam footage, Shia is in the back of a police car. \u201cYou got a president who don\u2019t give a sh-t about you and you\u2019re stuck in a police force that don\u2019t give a f\u2013k about you,\u201d he says to a police officer. \u201cSo, you want to arrest white people who don\u2019t give a f\u2013k? I came up to you trying to be nice. You stupid b\u2013ch. I came up to asking for a cigarette you dumb f\u2013k. Why would I ask you for a cigarette if I was f\u2013king racist, you stupid b\u2013ch. I was asking for a cigarette; You said, \u2018No.\u2019 I said, \u2018Word.\u2019 Then, you arrested me you dumb f\u2013k. They got cameras everywhere you dummy. I got more millionaire lawyers than you know what to do with, you stupid b\u2013ch.\u201d\n\nShia was reportedly booked around 4 AM, July 8, on multiple counts, including disorderly conduct, obstruction and public drunkenness. However, the actor was released from jail, that same day, at 11 AM ET on a $3,500 bond, as reported by TMZ.\n\nHere\u2019s was happened, according to police: Shia approached an unidentified individual for a cigarette, on the night of his arrest. When the person declined, that\u2019s when Shia began cussing in the presence of women and children. When he was told to leave he refused and became hostile toward a police officer. Then, the officer attempted to arrest Shia, and he ran to a nearby hotel. The actor was eventually arrested in the lobby of the hotel, while he continued to behave in an aggressive manner, as seen above. [Information via a statement posted on the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police website.]\n\nAnd, this isn\u2019t the Shia\u2019s first run-in with the law. He was arrested in 2014 in New York City for \u201cdrunken behavior.\u201d Shia was also arrested in 2008, in West Hollywood for drunk driving.\n\nHollywoodLifers, tell us your thoughts on Shia\u2019s wild rant.", "images": ["https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/shia-labeouf-arrest-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/shia-labeouf-arrest-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F07%2F11%2Fshia-labeouf-arrest-video-drunk-rant-police-footage%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2686510", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/shia-labeouf-arrest-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/11/shia-labeouf-arrest-video-drunk-rant-police-footage/", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Calls Cop \u2018F\u2013king B\u2013ch During Drunken Arrest: Watch Wild Video", "meta_data": {"description": "After Shia LaBeouf was drunkenly arrested on July 8, shocking body camera footage shows him going off on an explicit rant to police!
