There was good and bad this year, as always, but we have to admit this time around we were pleasantly surprised by just how great the convention was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re all still recovering from the exhausting convention, so forgive our uneven distribution of \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d among the staff\u2014we don\u2019t all fall in either \u201cfangasm\u201d or \u201cgrumpy Gus\u201d territory. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Without further ado, here are io9's winners and losers of Comic-Con 2018.\n\nWinners\n\nThe Clone Wars Is Saved!\n\nThere was no greater surprise this year at Comic-Con than the announcement that was made at the 10th anniversary panel for the beloved Clone Wars animated series. Fans had long accepted the series as having come to a close, even if it didn\u2019t quite get to end the way Lucasfilm Animation had planned it to. And yet, there were no leaks, no real solid rumors that it was even possible the show could get one last hurrah\u2014after all, Rebels only just ended earlier this year, and Resistance is on the way. So to see a trailer announcing 12 brand new episodes of the series, building on ideas the Clone Wars crew have been teasing for years at this point, was simply mindblowing. Ahsoka Tano was right: It has been awhile, but it was worth the wait to get this incredible news. \u2014James Whitbrook\n\nIron Fist Looks...Good?\n\nDespite the fact that he\u2019s the titular hero of the series, Danny Rand was one of the most disappointing parts of Iron Fist\u2019s first season for a number of different reasons, one of the most egregious being that you could clearly tell actor Finn Jones really hadn\u2019t committed himself to learning his fight choreography. With the first season still clearly in everyone\u2019s minds, the anticipation during the show\u2019s panel at this year\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con wasn\u2019t exactly high, but as Marvel\u2019s head of television Jeph Loeb gave the audience a look at a number of scenes from Iron Fist\u2019s second season, it became immediately clear that Jones got it together. Not only are Danny\u2019s fights going to be slicker, more technically complicated, and gorgeous to watch, everyone who\u2019s coming back this season is working on a higher level that\u2019s going to make the next chapter of the Iron Fist saga something to legitimately get hyped about. \u2014Charles Pulliam-Moore\n\nTGIF Playlist: 4/20 Weekend Vibes Read on The Inventory\n\nDoctor Who\u2019s Jodie Whittaker Had a Blast\n\nDoctor Who fans were already quivering with excitement that the show\u2019s Comic-Con presence would give us our first-ever glimpse of the next season, and a chance to see the show\u2019s first female Doctor strut her stuff. But beyond that stunning trailer, Comic-Con 2018 was also the first major chance for Whittaker to interact with Who fandom at large, and she grabbed that chance with both hands. From the fun video heralding her arrival at the panel, to surprising audiences at the Her Universe Fashion Show, to meeting the cutest little cosplayers and kicking ass at Entertainment Weekly\u2019s annual all-women panel celebrating female heroes, it was clear: The Doctor was in, and we loved her. \u2014James\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCastle Rock\u2019s Introduction to Stephen King\u2019s Amalgam Universe\n\nHollywood has long had a deep love for Stephen King, but the hunger for adaptations of the horror author\u2019s works has escalated mightily thanks to the blockbuster success of It. Hulu series Castle Rock has an offbeat premise that sets it apart from the rest: it tells an original story inspired by King\u2019s favorite fictional small town, a place where the top employer is Shawshank prison and nearly every household\u2019s hiding a few grisly secrets. Diehard King fans will enjoy the Easter eggs that weave into the narrative, but anyone who digs slow-burn, creepy psychological horror will want to tune into the show, which had its world-premiere screening at Comic-Con. \u2014Cheryl Eddy\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStar Trek: Discovery Loosens Up\n\nThe first season of Star Trek: Discovery could get a little too grim and self-serious for its own good, but what we saw of the show\u2019s second season at Comic-Con gave us a lot of hope that the bright optimism of Star Trek would shine strongly for the Discovery\u2019s sophomore outing. Questionable use of Lenny Kravitz aside, the trailer was filled with fun humor and a grand sense of adventure and exploration\u2014especially thanks to Anson Mount\u2019s arrival as the pre-Kirk Captain of the Enterprise, Christopher Pike, who seems to be having the time of his life both in front of and behind the Trek cameras. \u2014James\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamie Lee Curtis at the Halloween Panel\n\nAnyone who has attended a Comic-Con panel knows that the portion of the event that\u2019s set aside for audience questions is usually pretty forgettable, if not downright excruciating. That was not the case at the Halloween panel, where one fan stepped up to the Hall H mic and shared an incredible, deeply personal story about how he survived a very scary situation by drawing inspiration from Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019 character in the horror classic. The man (who was wearing a \u201cHaddonfield High\u201d t-shirt) received a standing ovation from the audience, and Curtis herself got up from the stage to give him a hug. It was one of Comic-Con\u2019s emotional high points, not just this year but any year. \u2014Cheryl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupergirl\u2019s Historic Announcement\n\nSupergirl\u2019s upcoming fourth season will focus on how the world begins to accept racist anti-alien sentiment in the wake of a devastating invasion that pushes Supergirl to her limits. While that story is particularly timely given our political climate, the show is also making a powerful statement about the importance of on-screen representation with the introduction of Nia Nil, a reimagined version of the Legion of Superheroes character Dream Girl, who next season will be a transgender reporter played by transgender actress and activist Nicole Maines. While the fact that Nia is trans might not play a huge role in her character\u2019s arc this season, her introduction in the show is momentous because she\u2019ll be the first transgender superhero on network television. Not only that, but Supergirl just single-handedly proved something we should all know to be true: It\u2019s not at all hard to actually cast transgender people to play transgender characters. \u2014Charles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople Outside of the Convention Center\n\nThere were thousands and thousands of fans crammed into the San Diego Convention Center every day of Comic-Con, taking in panels and roaming the main floor, but some of the most fun and creative activities were actually the off-site pop-up events. While everything in and around Comic-Con requires waiting in line, this year it was actually worth it for those who ventured out to eat at Taco Bell\u2019s Demolition Man restaurant, shop for supplies at the Purge City Emporium, totally immerse themselves in the DC Universe\u2019s new streaming shows, or join a group therapy session to work through their lingering grief over the end of Avengers: Infinity War. Sure, it\u2019s all marketing, but when it\u2019s this clever, fun, and/or tasty, we can\u2019t really complain. \u2014Cheryl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazing Animation\n\nEven though there were a number of epic trailers for live-action movies that got everyone excited during this year\u2019s Comic-Con, the animation presentations held their own and really demonstrated just how much more bold and imaginative the medium is in general right now. Nickelodeon\u2019s upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show is getting back to the original series\u2019 more mystical roots while also reimagining the iconic characters in a dynamic way that makes them feel fresh and fun. Voltron\u2019s giving the fandom the representation it craves by introducing Shiro\u2019s boyfriend Adam and teasing that a new Lion might be in the works that would completely transform the Legendary Defender. As impressive as the lines for Hall H were, the energy in the Steven Universe line was palpable\u2014and the show\u2019s panel delivered tens across the board with a surprise presentation of the newest episode \u201cLegs From Here to Homeworld\u201d and the announcement of a forthcoming movie that\u2019ll see the Crystal Gems facing a new foe. Hell, Invader Zim\u2019s coming back, Disenchantment actually looks kinda good, and The Dragon Prince is definitely a series to look out for. We\u2019re living in a golden age of television and a lot of it in the near future is going to be animated. \u2014Charles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 DC Movies Seize the Moment\n\nAt a Comic-Con with no major Marvel Studios presence, Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment had an opportunity they couldn\u2019t afford to squander\u2014a great chance to get fans really hyped for their next few movies. They didn\u2019t just take the chance, they reveled in it, delivering a disarmingly charming first look at Shazam! (which looks like a lovingly goofy movie that strikes at the heart of the DC movieverse\u2019s \u201cgrimdark\u201d reputation) and an epic pulpy trailer for Aquaman, bright and bold and jam-packed with underwater action. If that wasn\u2019t enough, fans in attendance got to bring the house down for an extremely early glimpse of the still-weeks-into-filming Wonder Woman 1984, and it sounds like was an absolute blast. DC came out of Comic-Con like royalty, and it deserved to. \u2014James\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Smith Pays Tribute to Jon Schnepp\n\nNot all news at Comic-Con this year was happy\u2014Wednesday brought word that writer-director Jon Schnepp, the architect behind The Death of Superman Lives and Metalpocalypse, tragically passed away after suffering a stroke. Schnepp\u2019s legacy in pop culture criticism was honored by Kevin Smith at his Hall H panel on Sunday, a fitting tribute to a writer and director beloved by many. \u2014James\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLosers\n\nHashtag Hall H Problems\n\nHall H was a bit of a mess this year. Thousands of fans waited for hours, or even overnight, in order to get a coveted spot at San Diego Comic-Con\u2019s main showcase room. But in some cases, they might not have needed to. There were reports that the hall had tons of empty seats and people were just walking in at different times of the day. Of course, that wasn\u2019t always happening, even at times when it should. Fans shared that sometimes they were kept out of Hall H\u2014even when dozens of seats were still empty inside! And that\u2019s not even getting into the problems with people holding spots in line for their friends, or line cutters who weren\u2019t stopped by security. \u2014Beth Elderkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fantastic Beasts panel\n\n\n\nWhile the new trailer for Fantastic Beasts sequel The Crimes of Grindelwald was magical on its own, Warner Bros.\u2019 decision to bring controversial star Johnny Depp onstage\u2014 in character as evil wizard Grindewald\u2014was not. It was a surprise, sure, but not the nice kind of surprise, since nobody in the audience (especially those that were heard booing the actor) was about to forget who was under that wig and make-up. Plus, there was the added uncomfortable subtext that the panel for Aquaman (which included Amber Heard, Depp\u2019s ex-wife) was the next to take the stage. \u2014Cheryl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Bozo Who Asked Amber Heard to Untie Him\n\nAfter the uncomfortable situation that was having Heard appear on stage right after Fantastic Beasts, an audience member dressed in bondage gear had the gall to tell Heard during a Q&A that he needed her help to get out of his fetish outfit. Behavior like this is sadly more common than it should be\u2014and by that, I mean it should never happen at all. Don\u2019t be the person who tries to coerce a celebrity (or really anyone at conventions) into participating in your sex stuff without their enthusiastic consent. Never be that person. \u2014Beth\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSony, For Sharing Almost Nothing\n\nNobody could have predicted the James Gunn news (the timing of which meant the fired Guardians of the Galaxy director did not appear as part of Sony Pictures\u2019 showcase panel as planned). But even beyond that, Sony was a pretty big disappointment. The studio\u2019s current projects have enormous fan interest, especially Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Venom, and those few thousand who were lucky enough to score a seat in Hall H got glimpses of both. If you were watching from afar, however, you had to content yourself with breathless descriptions of the footage, which still has yet to be shared online. \u2014Cheryl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Movie Fans\n\nAs we mentioned, San Diego Comic-Con 2018 was a great year for DC, but fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe were treated to a whole heap of nothing. No trailers, no announcements, not even any surprise appearances. It was a ghost con. Marvel announced earlier this year that it wouldn\u2019t be appearing at this year\u2019s con, and I mean, it makes sense\u2014Captain Marvel only recently finished filming, and any question about the Infinity War sequel would have to be met with stony awkward silence. However, it did mean that one of the two largest comic book film franchises in the galaxy was nowhere to be found at the greatest fan event of the year. \u2014Beth\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeph Loeb\n\nSpeaking of Marvel, executive Jeph Loeb moderated a number of the studio\u2019s panels at this year\u2019s Comic-Con, and while the panelists themselves all did excellent jobs at representing their respective shows, Loeb himself made a number of inappropriate gaffes at different panels that were insensitive in a way that made one wonder if he was actively trying to be offensive. Even though the next season of Iron Fist looks better than the first, it\u2019s still really disappointing that Netflix decided to cast Danny Rand as a white guy but hey, there\u2019s no changing that at this point. That being said, there was absolutely no reason for Loeb to moderate the panel wearing gi and making jokes about Mr. Miyagi. What\u2019s more, kicking off the Cloak & Dagger panel by asking the audience to split into gender groups in order to chant is...just weird, especially when you go on to misgender a fan during the Q&A portion of a panel. It\u2019s obvious that Loeb likes being up on stage and so long as Marvel\u2019s shows come to conventions, it\u2019s likely that he\u2019ll be the one to introduce them to fans\u2014but in the future, it\u2019d probably be best if he kept his \u201cjokes\u201d to himself. \u2014Charles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Buffy Reboot Non-Announcement\n\nThe possibility of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show reboot has been talked about for months. Years, even. While fans might be divided on whether or not we need a reboot of a reboot\u2014I personally don\u2019t see a point, given how the show works best within the context of its time\u2014there\u2019s no doubt that it could be one of the most-talked-about reboots of the past decade. With that said, the announcement was a ridiculous blunder. It was teased in a story from The Hollywood Reporter during San Diego Comic-Con, but nothing was announced at San Diego Comic-Con. And creator Joss Whedon was at the con this year, appearing on the Dr. Horrible panel, so why didn\u2019t he have something prepared? One can only speculate\u2014I personally think it\u2019s possible the reboot team is not super confident fans are going to respond well. But no matter the cause, it definitely left a mark that might be hard for the new show to brush off. \u2014Beth\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTitans\u2019 Gritty Arrival\n\nConsidering how much flack Warner Bros. gets for how gritty its big-screen adaptations of DC Comics\u2019 heroes have been, we weren\u2019t expecting Titans\u2014based around characters made extra popular by a fun animated children\u2019s show\u2014to go that route. But go it did, and hugely so, in its first trailer. I never expected Dick Grayson to say the words \u201cFuck Batman\u201d but well, now I\u2019ll never un-hear them. We have to admit, where we were once excited by the show anchoring WB\u2019s original content on its DC Universe streaming service (which is shaping up better than expected!), we\u2019re now super hesitant. At least we\u2019re still very excited about the Teen Titans Go! movie making fun of the DC film universe.\u2014Jill Pantozzi", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/sbinfvuauf8rlq98c4jr.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/sbinfvuauf8rlq98c4jr.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-biggest-winners-and-losers-of-san-diego-comic-con-2-1827827459", "title": "The Biggest Winners and Losers of San Diego Comic-Con 2018", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "Y4KzRYvFDIszZROrGQfpcKGpEMqT5ncYtgHhRW8D7P0", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/eh1hvjxamru5z6aobgwc.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/eh1hvjxamru5z6aobgwc.png", "keywords": "San Diego Comic-Con, Comic-Con 2018, Marvel, Warner Bros, NetFlix, Streaming, DC Universe, Animation, Horror, io9", "news_keywords": "San Diego Comic-Con, Comic-Con 2018, Marvel, Warner Bros, NetFlix, Streaming, DC Universe, Animation, Horror, io9", "twitter": {"url": "https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-biggest-winners-and-losers-of-san-diego-comic-con-2-1827827459", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@io9", "title": "The Biggest Winners and Losers of San Diego Comic-Con 2018", "description": "Comic-Con 2018 has come to a close, and whether io9 staff were seeing it up close and personal in San Diego or watching from afar back home, we experienced a lot.
