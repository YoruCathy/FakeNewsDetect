Danielle started and entire social media war against the abuser and slammed him with her sharp words.\n\nAt first, Danielle posted on Instagram a snap meant for the media in which she assured them she never has and never will sell a story on her sister.\n\nIn order to be left alone, however, she did address the situation, later on, slamming Belafonte in another tweet: \u201d @stephenthinks11 8 years of abusive calls me and my mum have had stating we would never see Melanie again.I am laughing and celebrating as you were wrong. you are a sorry excuse of a man !!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the left to the left everything you own in the box to the left hope you \u2026 go to jail and rot in hell!!\u201d she added.\n\nHer series of tweets came shortly after Belafonte also decided to open up about the situation and tell his side of the story.\n\nStephen denied all of Mel B\u2019s allegations, including the ones about him beating her up and forcing her into threesomes, claiming that it is all \u201ca smear campaign\u201d against him.\n\nBelafonte\u2019s rep claimed that after legal action will be taking by the man it will be proven that Mel B lied in order to cover up her own marital misconducts. Furthermore, she tried to gain leverage with the kids\u2019 custody by lying.\n\nThey also alleged that when the truth about the extent to which Mel B lied in the depiction of her marriage will be revealed real victims of domestic violence will be very offended by her outrageous accusations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Belafonte innocent until proven guilty or are you convinced he did all of those horrible things to Mel B?", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mel-B-NYP.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jessie_mel-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/T.I.-Tiny-Harris-Femcees-Romance-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5b75db9b6d10b.image_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gabrielle-union-kaavia-dwayne-wade-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mel-B-sister.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kelly-osbourne-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen_Shot_2020_01_26_at_5.00.03_PM.0.0-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mel-B-Says-She-Cant-Find-Work-In-The-United-States-Asks-For-The-Courts-Permission-To-Move-Back-To-Th-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mel-B-sister.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/mel-bs-sister-slams-abusive-husband-stephen-belafonte-you-are-a-sorry-excuse-of-a-man-30530/", "title": "Mel B\u2019s Sister Slams Abusive Husband Stephen Belafonte \u2013 \u201cYou Are A Sorry Excuse Of A Man!\u201d", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "danielle brown, mel b, stephen belafonte,", "keywords": "celebrity news, danielle brown, mel b, stephen belafonte,", "description": "Mel B's sister, Danielle Brown has decided to speak against the alleged abuse Stephen Belafonte has put his wife through after Mel got a restraining", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mel B\u2019s Sister Slams Abusive Husband Stephen Belafonte \u2013 \u201cYou Are A Sorry Excuse Of A Man!\u201d", "description": "Mel B's sister, Danielle Brown has decided to speak against the alleged abuse Stephen Belafonte has put his wife through after Mel got a restraining", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/mel-bs-sister-slams-abusive-husband-stephen-belafonte-you-are-a-sorry-excuse-of-a-man-30530/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Mel-B-sister.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-06", "modified_time": "2017-04-06", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/brandonfitch/", "section": "Music", "tag": "stephen belafonte"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491408000.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
