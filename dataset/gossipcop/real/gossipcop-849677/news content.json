This might be the least glamorous beauty story you read today, but probably the most useful for all time. Having acne-prone skin has worked to my benefit in two strange ways. One: My prescription retinol doubles for 86ing fine lines and wrinkles, keeping me Dorian Gray young! Two: My zits forced me to become skilled at doing my makeup. Still, even with my many (many, many) years of pimple-masking experience, I\u2019ve only now learned some new techniques from makeup artists on how to cover every type of breakout.\n\nWhen it's a whitehead.\n\nwhitehead Getty\n\nStart with a clean, dry face (duh). \u201cIt\u2019s really important that your concealer has a dry, thickish consistency \u2014 almost like a putty,\u201d says makeup artist Mally Roncal, founder of Mally Beauty. \u201cThe wetter and more slippery a concealer it is, the harder it is for it to adhere to that mound/bubble. This kind of concealer is usually going to be found in a pot or tube, not in a wand \u2014 that type is too thin.\u201d Once you\u2019ve found your spackle, use a small brush, like a precision eyeliner brush, to cover both the whitehead and the red, inflamed area surrounding it. \u201cBe as targeted as possible. You could even use a magnifying mirror,\u201d says Roncal. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to cover any of the good skin around the pimple or you\u2019ll create a \u2018look at my zit\u2019 bulls-eye.\u201d After application, give the zit a gentle pat with a finger so it doesn\u2019t look tall. Translucent powder can make a whitehead look shiny and white; instead set your concealer with a fluffy brush dipped in a powder foundation that matches your skin tone.\n\n\u201cIf the zit refuses to be covered by concealer and is in a favorable place \u2014 a chin or where Cindy Crawford\u2019s mole is \u2014 I have been known to take a black eyeliner and make it a mole,\u201d says Roncal. \u201cWhen I first met my husband, I had a \u2018mole,\u2019 and a month later he asked me, \u2018What happened to your beauty mark?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen it's a cystic breakout.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6a6129d716fd4ffad6d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-531655919.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6993bc2fb084fd8fc8f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-531372223%252520(1).jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6b6966c5a7bcada415d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-700654304.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6abc14da470bc4928a7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-696927818.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/584840a4cb76031c7baa0faf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/concealer-zit.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6b9c14da470bc4928a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-660805424.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5e84c19041364700089bfefe/master/h_180%2Cc_limit/laura-mercier-translucent-loose-setting-powder-gwp.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6b649774c7d1ccc7a95/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-817319014.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca698129d716fd4ffad6b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-521226333.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6990d0e69150907f06e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-181707522.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7ca6a449774c7d1ccc7a93/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-657421454.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/584840a4cb76031c7baa0faf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/concealer-zit.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Sullivan", "Kate Sulliva"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/cover-every-pimple", "title": "Here's How to Cover Every Type of Pimple", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kate Sullivan", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Glaring whitehead?
