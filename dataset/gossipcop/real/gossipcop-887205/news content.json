But for Julia Roberts, there\u2019s only one word to describe it: Oprah.\n\nOn Sunday, the 49-year-old Oscar winner kept it casual as she headed to Oprah\u2019s brunch at her home in Montecito, Calif., where she glowed in a black blouse with dark-tinted sunglasses, a glass in one hand, and a blinding smile.\n\nAnd while any Julia Roberts appearance is enough to get us excited, the actress made heads turn as she arrived with her handsome husband Daniel Moder (the couple are parents to three children together). He wore a plaid shirt and sunglasses and kept his gorgeous wife company at the event.\n\nImage zoom Rob Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nSo what goes down at a brunch with Oprah?
