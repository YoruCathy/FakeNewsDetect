Hopefully, it will lead to a lot of healing.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'The Keepers' on Netflix: Will There Be a Season 2?\n\nThere has also been a lot of movement in terms of investigating Maskell. \u201cThe Keepers\u201d explores the murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik, who disappeared in November 1969 and whose body was discovered in January of 1970. The documentary investigates whether Maskell had Sister Cathy killed because she was about to expose him and others for sexual abusing teenage students at Archbishop Keough High School. Maskell died in 2001, and until his death, he had denied the allegations.\n\nAccording to CNN, Father Maskell\u2019s body was exhumed in February to see whether his DNA matched the DNA from the murder scene. Two days before \u201cThe Keepers\u201d was released, Baltimore County Police found that the DNA profile did not match.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s prevailing theory was that his DNA would be there,\u201d White added, referring to many people\u2019s idea that Maskell ordered the murder but himself did not orchestrate it. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge outward sign that they are taking Maskell seriously as a suspect now, and it definitely begs the question why these tests weren\u2019t done when he was alive and Jean Wehner [Jane Doe] was coming forward. He could\u2019ve been arrested.\u201d\n\nAccording to White, the documentary prompted a lot of digging into Maskell\u2019s past, specifically when he relocated to Ireland. According to the Baltimore Sun, Maskell worked as a psychologist amid his sexual abuse allegations in the United States. Whether he assessed any children or teens during his time in Ireland could not yet be determined by the agency doing the review.\n\n\u201cWe were only concentrating in our documentary for the most part on certain parts of Maskell\u2019s character but he had a long career before and after his time at Keough,\u201d White said. \u201cA predator doesn\u2019t stop abusing so it\u2019s been a sad truth that people from other sides of his career \u2014 and from Keough \u2014 have come out of the woodwork.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'The Keepers' Filmmaker: Father Maskell Abused 40 Victims, Not Just the 6 in Netflix's Doc\n\nMoreover, a few days after the documentary was released, the Baltimore Police Department launched an online form for people to report sexual offenses related to the docuseries.\n\n\u201cWe have been contacted by victims from the past who want to report the sex offenses that occurred to them,\u201d the department wrote on its Facebook page.\n\nIn July, a Change.org petition was launched and has since garnered over 42,000 signatures asking the Archdiocese of Baltimore to release information they have on Maskell. White told TheWrap he had asked for these documents during the making of the documentary, and is \u201cdubious\u201d whether they would even release them now.\n\nLastly, a few weeks before the series came out, Maryland extended the statute of limitations for victims of childhood sexual abuse, on which the senate voted unanimously. The previous statute of limitations provided that child sex abuse victims could only sue until age 25 \u2014 now, they can sue until the age of 38.\n\n\u201cIt might be people doing the right thing for the wrong reasons but it\u2019s good news for sexual abuse victims,\u201d White added.\n\nHowever, the major developments in the case since the documentary\u2019s debut won\u2019t change White\u2019s mind about making a second season. Previously, he had said he wouldn\u2019t want to make a follow-up season given how \u201cpainful\u201d the process was for all the people involved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still standing behind that, but I\u2019m not going to say never,\u201d White said about a second season. \u201cThere is a lot of information coming to us right now and there could be certain developments that I would document. But, at the moment, I\u2019m not dead set on that. I\u2019m still preoccupied with promoting the series and to make sure it has the largest impact that it can have. I\u2019m still very happy where it ended. The series will end up shaking the branches in Baltimore and nationwide to have more information coming out that could lead to justice and murder being solved.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/the-keepers-major-players-split.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/the-keepers-a-joseph-maskell-neil-magnus-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TheKeepers.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TheKeepers-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-keepers-sister-cathy-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/TheKeepers.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Phil Hornshaw", "Ross A.
