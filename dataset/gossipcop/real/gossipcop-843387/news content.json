It was a surprise to them, too.\n\nRenee explained to E! News that the couple got a marriage license on the spur of the moment but didn\u2019t plan a wedding ceremony because they wanted to do it spontaneously. It doesn\u2019t get much more spontaneous than what they ended up doing.\n\n\u201cWe were going to bed!\u201d Renee explained to E!. \u201cWe were going to bed and he like busted out the ring and we were like, 'Oh man I guess we should do this now.' So we ended up going on Yelp and we found a 24-hour pastor to come to our backyard. It was so handy and his name was Pastor Pete and he lived around the corner from us, so he was there. They were very concerned by the way because it was 1 o'clock in the morning, so technically it was Sunday and they were very concerned about us calling, they were like, 'Is everything OK? Have you guys been drinking? What's happening?' We're like, 'It's fine, you can come down.' So we had to get a witness and we called and woke up a friend of ours and got it done.\u201d\n\n(They live in Las Vegas, obviously.)\n\nFollow SI Wrestling on Facebook\n\nFollow\n\nThe wedding was in the wee hours of April 9 and fans noticed Ambrose\u2019s makeshift wedding ring (a hairband) the next night on Raw.\n\nYoung said she was \u201csurprised\u201d people noticed so quickly and quickly confirmed the speculation.", "images": ["https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTI3NTgwMzU4NTE4MDMz/dean-ambrose-wwe-championship-battlegroundjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTAyNzg0OTczNzQzNDg4/renee-young-dean-ambrosejpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTA2NjM0MDczODEwMTkz/wwe-payback-house-horrors-sale-richmond-missourijpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MDMwNDkyMDg0NTQ0ODk2/wwe-dean-ambrose-injury-surgery-mrsa-interviewjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MTA0OTM1MTQwNjMxOTM2/wwe-dean-ambrose-renee-young-wedding-yelp-pastorjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MjU2ODMyMDI4ODEzMTg1/alligator-wwe-raw.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTA1MDI2NDA5OTMyMDQ5/mick-foley-surgery-wwe-hip-replacement-scar-photojpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTcwNDMyMDUwNDM5NDQx/raw-undertaker-shane-mcmahonjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_600/MTY3NDcxMDIwMjQ3MDk4OTky/si_logo_60x600_red.png", "https://www.si.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTY3NDQ0MjMyMjY3NjM4Mzg0/si_mobile_sticky_nav_logo_435x100-1.svg", "https://www.si.com/assets-global/play-button-blk.svg?v=2020-04-17-205441-3d5ce40-015427", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTI2NDU1ODgyNzg2MTc2/triple-h-dean-ambrose-wwe-leadjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDI3MDEwMjI2OTg4NDE2/image-placeholder-title.png"], "top_img": "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MTA0OTM1MTQwNjMxOTM2/wwe-dean-ambrose-renee-young-wedding-yelp-pastorjpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Gartland", "Extra Mustard"], "canonical_link": "https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/04/26/wwe-dean-ambrose-renee-young-wedding-yelp-pastor", "title": "WWE\u2019s Dean Ambrose and Renee Young's weird wedding", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "Zxtw3BlUC0tAgI2yiNKzgXU8BuqxJ_-54-jrOZ6BN1E", "generator": "Tempest - www.saymedia.com", "pinterest": "nohover", "author": "Dan Gartland and Extra Mustard", "description": "How very Vegas of them.", "keywords": "wrestling,Extra Mustard", "section": "Extra Mustard", "pagetype": "article", "item-id": "ci02553a9fe0132511", "published": "2017-04-26T20:51:31Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "ABG-SI LLC.
