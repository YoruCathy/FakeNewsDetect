I know Jada\u2019s in. She\u2019s been in Scientology a long time,\u201d Remini said. \u201cI never saw Will (Smith) there, but I saw Jada at the Celebrity Centre. They opened up a Scientology school, and have since closed it. But Jada, I had seen her at the Scientology Celebrity Centre all the time.\u201d\n\n>> Read more trending news\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, Pinkett Smith did not return multiple comment requests.\n\nBy Tuesday, however, The Huffington Post reported that the actress responded to Remini\u2019s claims on Twitter.\n\nAlthough she acknowledged she has studied Dianetics, Scientology\u2019s main text, and Study Technology, a teaching method developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, she also said she\u2019s studied and participated in aspects of other religions as well.\n\nRemini has not responded to Pinkett Smith\u2019s rebuttal. Pinkett Smith ended her Twitter thread with what some may interpret as a direct response to Remini\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cI practice human kindness, and I believe that we each have the right to determine what we are and what we are not,\u201d she tweeted, \u201cNO ONE ELSE can hold that power.\u201d\n\nSupport real journalism.
