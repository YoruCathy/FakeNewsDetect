The mother-of-two is also one for following a colour scheme. This has notably been the case for St Patrick\u2019s day each year, when Kate wears a variation on green in homage to the Emerald Isle. In 17 March, 2012 the British Royal, who wed Prince William in 2011, wore a long, dark green coat and she also wore green to attend the St Patrick's Day Parade at Mons Barracks on March 17, 2014 in Aldershot.\n\nGETTY Kate Middleton and Melania Trump in blue: Both are a fan of this hue\n\nThis year was no different for Kate. Perhaps learning from the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s cues Melania Trump, 47, wore green to meet King Abdullah II of Jordan and his wife Queen Rania, at the White House, on April 5, 2017. The former model from Slovenia wore a jewel-coloured hue - one of the colours in Jordan\u2019s official flag. The green dress featured a back belt to nip in the waist - a styling trick Kate has been known to employ numerous times.\n\nGETTY Kate Middleton and Melania Trump: The pair can also pull off bold colours with aplomb\n\nMelania Trump in pictures Sat, July 28, 2018 America's First Lady Melania Trump in pictures.

The subdued event in Englefield Green, England meant Kate needed to take a backseat. Similarly, Melania wore a nude two-piece to visit the Magritte Museum, on May 25, 2017 - only five days later. Blue is a signature colour of Kate\u2019s and she is especially partial to a baby blue. She has worn the shade numerous times, once in Luxembourg on May 11, 2016.\n\nGETTY Kate Middleton and Melania Trump: Both wore green to may homage to different countries\n\nGETTY Kate Middleton and Melania Trump have worn similar white outfits too", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-04-19.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/285x190/810238_1.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/750x445/810995.jpg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/387394.jpg", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/285x190/810645_1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/750x445/810995.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Hodgkin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/style/810995/Melania-Trump-Kate-Middleton-style", "title": "Melania Trump and Kate Middleton are style TWINS - but who is the real queen of fashion?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "MELANIA TRUMP is wearing a number of ensembles that are strikingly similar to those worn in the past by Kate Middleton.
