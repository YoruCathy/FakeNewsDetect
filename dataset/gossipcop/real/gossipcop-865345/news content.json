But he\u2019s not always up to speed on the show. \u201cI don\u2019t watch it as much,\u201d he said in an interview in New York, where he was promoting his role in Korean director Lee Chang-dong\u2019s \u201cBurning\u201d at the New York Film Festival. \u201cI\u2019m still really close with all the co-stars, so I get the down-low on what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he\u2019s put the whirlwind experience of the AMC hit behind him, and said that fewer people stop him on the street to discuss it these days. Having appeared in two acclaimed festival films this year \u2014 the Cannes-winning \u201cBurning\u201d and Boots Riley\u2019s Sundance sensation \u201cSorry to Bother You\u201d \u2014 he said he had gone from acceptance to appreciation for the opportunity to leave \u201cWalking Dead\u201d for good. \u201cIn hindsight, it was just a natural end,\u201d he said, recalling Glenn\u2019s grisly death scene at the start of Season 7. \u201cEveryone felt it. I wasn\u2019t pining to be off the show. It was just the story, and you service the story. Also, there\u2019s something very beautiful about the end, turning the page and closing the book.\u201d\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nHe recalled the scene at the Hollywood Forever cemetery, where the Season 7 finale screened followed by a \u201cTalking Dead\u201d discussion with the cast. \u201cIt never rains in L.A., but it was raining that day, and they only had black umbrellas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in a fucking mausoleum. Everyone\u2019s in dark clothing. I was like, \u2018This is so bizarre, it\u2019s like a funeral.\u2019 It was perfect, because it was like, this dude is dead. It reached out of the screen and became an experience for me.\u201d\n\nYeun has wrestled publicly with the aftermath of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d telling Vulture in 2017 that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t know what to do with Glenn. \u2026they didn\u2019t acknowledge the connection people had with the character until he was gone.\u201d He added that being on the show \u201cwas tough because I never felt like he got his fair due. I never felt like he got it from an outward perception.\u201d\n\nWith more time to consider that period, Yeun is looking at the bigger picture. \u201cI left \u2018Walking Dead\u2019 and I kind of had an existential crisis \u2014 not because I longed to be back there, but because I was made to feel the loneliness of life, which is that decisions aren\u2019t made for you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get swallowed up by whatever the thing that you\u2019re a part of.\u201d After the show, he became a father. \u201cYou get out of that show, and you\u2019re about to have a kid, and you\u2019re an adult now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you go, \u2018Holy shit, I am in charge of my life. I am making choices. There\u2019s no next step.\u201d\n\nHe has no interest in returning to play Glenn, even if the opportunity came up. \u201cSometimes people pitch to me, \u2018Dude, wouldn\u2019t it be so cool if you did a Glenn origin movie?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018No, that\u2019d be horrible.\u2019 That was so long ago. I was another person. I don\u2019t think I could go back there. That person was inherently trapped in whatever people thought he was. I fed into it and I believed in it, too \u2014 until I got out.\u201d\n\nWith that thinking in mind, he passed on a lot of projects. He\u2019s been doing a flurry of voiceover work \u2014 for \u201cVoltron\u201d and \u201cStretch Armstrong & the Flex Fighters,\u201d among others \u2014 but has been more selective about movie roles. \u201cI had the luxury of being on a TV show,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get the cushion of having some income that you can save for a rainy day. That is still scary, but it makes you a little bit braver to pass on things. I realize how hellish it can be when I\u2019m doing something that I don\u2019t believe in, that is retreading territory.\u201d\n\nAs for doing voiceovers, Yeun said that it provided him with the opportunity to escape the expectations that come with being cast as Asian American characters. \u201cVoiceover work, for me, has been a strange thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m almost more free when I\u2019m there than when I\u2019m in front of the camera, because I\u2019m just an actor there. When you\u2019re on camera, sometimes the parameters are that you have to justify yourself more, you have to explain why your character would look like this.\u201d\n\nWhen he meets with filmmakers about potential roles, he said, he always asks why the choice was made to cast an Asian American actor. \u201cIt\u2019s become its own nuanced trap, sometimes, when it\u2019s an ethnically ambiguous role,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also thinking about people who fit that role. even if you\u2019re not putting it on the page that it\u2019s an Asian person, there\u2019s a reason why someone might conclude that this person should an Asian person. Maybe it\u2019s because they fit the parameters of what this person is, based on what preconceived notions that they have of Asian people.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s attached to provide voiceover work for a feature-length adaptation of the comic book series \u201cChew,\u201d he\u2019s keeping his options open for the future. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of growing up and accepting that you don\u2019t have to fit into the parameters or molds that life has dictated for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really on you to create that for yourself. That\u2019s been my motivation \u2014 to keep expanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurning\u201d is screening this week at the New York Film Festival.
