For years, I was like, 'Please let me grow some kind of curvature!' But it did not happen. So...this is my natural form for the most part. I'm sure that will change as the years go on,\" she told Refiner29 back in 2012. \"But, yeah, I have a boy body. I work out when I'm in a movie\u2026like on Spider-Man, they get you a trainer, which is awesome, so then I do it. But, if there isn't someone yelling in my face then 'm just not into it. Pilates is the one thing that makes me happy while I'm doing it. But other than that, it puts me in a bad mood to lift stuff over my head. I hate it. But it is important to do it for my health, so I need to do it more.\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.167xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-634467178-1520807612.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-miranda-kerr-beauty-diaries-04-1511817927.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.167xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Harper'S Bazaar Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/g19398800/celebrity-favorite-workouts/", "title": "The Exact Workout And Fitness Routines Celebrities Swear By", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "The Exact Workout And Fitness Routines Celebrities Swear By", "description": "This is how 31 celebrities stay fit and toned.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/g19398800/celebrity-favorite-workouts/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.167xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-07-02 01:55:58", "published_time": "2018-03-11 11:12:00", "section": "Diet & Fitness", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.167xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Celebrities On Their Favorite Fitness Routines - The Favorite Workouts of Celebrity Fitness Routines", "description": "This is how 31 of our favorite celebrities stay fit and toned.", "keywords": "celebrity fitness, celebrity workouts, workouts", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "gallery", "sailthru.tags": "Beauty,beauty,diet-fitness,workouts,celebrity workouts,celebrity fitness", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-11T23:12:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.167xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-628443534-1520807613.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "The Exact Workout And Fitness Routines Celebrities Swear By", "sailthru.excerpt": "Yoga and pilates might sound like the only workout options reserved for Hollywood stars, but these days, celebrities are training more and more like professional athletes.
