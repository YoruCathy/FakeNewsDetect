The nuptials at City Hall came eight years to the day that the duo met.\n\n\u201cWe always knew we wanted to get married on Nov. 2 because that\u2019s when we met,\u201d Lavin, 35, told PEOPLE. \u201cI knew I was gonna marry her the second I met her. We thought about doing it at the drive-thru but we couldn\u2019t go through with it, so I said I was down for City Hall. Fancy weddings aren\u2019t our thing.\u201d\n\nThe couple had been talking about marriage as long as 6 years ago, but life got in the way after Lavin\u2019s accident left him comatose for 9 days. He now says he\u2019s 100 percent recovered.\n\n\u201cMy coma \u2026 really messed up things. If you go in a coma it really messes with your social life, so don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, joking. \u201cBut when I got [through] my wreck \u2026 it opened my eyes, and we had to work on our relationship more and make It more of a priority. We had to find ourselves \u2013 [then] everything was cool.\u201d\n\nThe wedding \u2013 in which Lavin donned a suit and Siordia wore a cocktail dress \u2013 had been planned for a few weeks. Next up: thinking about the honeymoon.\n\n\u201cI told Roxanne we can go anywhere in the world she wants to go and do anything she wants to do,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, she\u2019s got some decision making to do.\u201d\n\nSiordia has a daughter, Raquel, 13, from a previous relationship. Lavin plans to formally adopt her.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=314&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2012%2F11%2Ftj-lavin-600.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2012%2F11%2Ftj-lavin-600.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=314&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2012%2F11%2Ftj-lavin-600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mark Gray"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/tj-lavin-marries-roxanne-siordia-wedding-is-at-las-vegass-city-hall/", "title": "TJ Lavin Marries Roxanne Siordia; Wedding Is at Las Vegas's City Hall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Wedding", "news_keywords": "Couples,Wedding", "description": "Two years after a crash that left him in a coma, the BMX icon ties the knot in Las Vegas", "og": {"title": "TJ Lavin Marries Roxanne Siordia; Wedding Is at Las Vegas's City Hall", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/tj-lavin-marries-roxanne-siordia-wedding-is-at-las-vegass-city-hall/", "description": "Talk about a happily ever after!
