The Hollywood star wore her brunette hair down with some pinned back, giving onlookers a full view of her multiple back tattoos. The natural beauty kept her base make-up minimal but stood out with her dark red lipstick which she matched with her nail polish. The Salt actress seemed in high spirits at the event, who she attended with Activist Loung Ung, despite her film First They Killed My Father missing out on the award for Best Foreign Language film, which lost to In The Fade.\n\nGETTY Critics' Choice Awards 2018: Angelina Jolie stunned in a white-feather dress\n\nGETTY Critics' Choice Awards: Angelina posed confidently in the figure-hugging bardot ensemble\n\nCritics' Choice Awards 2018: Best and worst dressed Fri, January 12, 2018 Critics' Choice Awards 2018: The best and worst dressed from the red carpet.

The Award-winning film veteran famously split from Brad Pitt, 54, in 2016. It is believed that Angelina hasn\u2019t dated anyone since the high-profile break up, although she was recently linked to Cambodian filmmaker and lyricist PraCh Ly, a claim her people have strongly denied. A source told People: \u201cShe isn't dating anyone and won't be for a very long time. She is focused on her children and their needs.\u201d\n\nGETTY Critics' Choice Awards: Angelina showed off her multiple back tattoos\n\nElsewhere at the event, held at Santa Monica, California, first-time host Olivia Munn, 37, stunned in a scarlet floor-length gown which featured an array of jewels. Ahead of the show, Olivia admitted that she wouldn\u2019t shy away from bringing up the recent Hollywood sexual harassment scandal at the event, after speaking out publicly about her personal experiences. She told the Daily Mail: \u201cHosting an awards show pales in comparison to the legal and illegal threats that I've had to (face) and that so many other women who have spoken out have had to go through. \u201cIt's not as easy to name names as people think. And when you go out publicly and do that, as we know with one of Brett Ratner's accusers, there's defamation lawsuits that come forward.\n\nGETTY Critics' Choice Awards: Angelina stood out with her dark red lipstick\n\nGETTY Critics' Choice Awards: Angelina attended the event with Activist Loung Ung", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-04-19.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/285x190/903665_1.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/750x445/903681.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/285x190/903659_1.jpg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/328731.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/750x445/903681.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Masters"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/903681/Critics-Choice-Awards-2018-Angelina-Jolie-white-feather-dress-Olivia-Munn-Brad-Pritt", "title": "Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018: Angelina Jolie steals show in eye-grabbing feather dress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "ANGELINA JOLIE ensured all eyes were on her at the 23rd Annual Critics\u2019 Choice Awards last night by wearing a striking white-feathered dress.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018: Angelina Jolie steals show in eye-grabbing feather dress", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/903681/Critics-Choice-Awards-2018-Angelina-Jolie-white-feather-dress-Olivia-Munn-Brad-Pritt", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/750x445/903681.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "entertainment,celebrities,headlines,autoplay_video,UploadExpress,Angelina Jolie,Critics' Choice Awards,Olivia Munn", "section": "Celebrity News", "description": "ANGELINA JOLIE ensured all eyes were on her at the 23rd Annual Critics\u2019 Choice Awards last night by wearing a striking white-feathered dress."}, "news_keywords": "entertainment,celebrities,headlines,autoplay_video,UploadExpress,Angelina Jolie,Critics' Choice Awards,Olivia Munn", "article": {"tag": "Olivia Munn", "published_time": "2018-01-12T08:43:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-12T09:39:46+00:00", "expiration_time": "2018-02-11", "section": "Celebrity News", "image_count": 6, "video_count": 1, "word_count": 648, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "author": "Samantha Masters", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/750x445/903681.jpg"}, "title": "Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018: Angelina Jolie steals show in eye-grabbing feather dress", "description": "ANGELINA JOLIE ensured all eyes were on her at the 23rd Annual Critics\u2019 Choice Awards last night by wearing a striking white-feathered dress."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Critics\u2019 Choice Awards 2018: Angelina Jolie steals show in eye-grabbing feather dress", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515746580.0, "source": "https://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
