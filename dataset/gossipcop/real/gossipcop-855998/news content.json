And on Wednesday\u2019s The Real Housewives of New Jersey \u201cReunion Secrets Revealed\u201d special, Friend of the Housewives Danielle Staub made it to 20!\n\nThe 55-year-old reality star, who starred on the hit Bravo show\u2019s first two seasons before returning this year, dropped the news that she and boyfriend Matt Caffrey are engaged to be married \u2014 news of which PEOPLE first reported in May.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nWhile a date wasn\u2019t officially set, Staub revealed she had already started building her wedding party. \u201cI\u2019ve invited Teresa [Giudice] to be one of my maid of honors, along with my daughters [Christine, 23, and Jillian, 19]. And Margaret [Josephs], and Melissa [Gorga], and about 12 other people who are in my wedding party.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Marty Caffrey and Danielle Staub Jim Spellman/Getty\n\nCaffrey\u2019s proposal was caught by RHONJ cameras, footage of which was shown on Wednesday\u2019s episode.\n\n\u201cThe engagement was simply beautiful. He is such a gentleman,\u201d Staub said.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t kidding. Caffrey had arranged for Staub (with the help of Giudice and Josephs) to tour the grounds of a beautiful mansion, where they stumbled upon an outdoor fountain. There, a violinist played Pachelbel\u2019s \u201cCanon in D\u201d as a handful of couples danced around them.\n\nJust then, Caffrey emerged from the crowd, taking Staub by surprise. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Staub said upon seeing him. \u201cIs this really happening?\u201d\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/BPTrlG5gsBc/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\n\u201cBaby, when I first met you, I was struck with how beautiful you are. As I got to know you, I fell in love with you. I\u2019ll do everything I can to love you, to protect you, and to keep you safe,\u201d he said, taking a ring out of his pocket. \u201cDanielle Staub, will you marry me?\u201d\n\nStaub\u2019s response? \u201cAbsolutely. One hundred percent,\u201d she said, kissing Caffrey and throwing her arms around him.\n\nThe ring was a sight to see too. Caffrey picked out a round cut diamond with four prongs and an eternity band \u2014 a perfect representation of their love.\n\n\u201cShe deserves it. She deserves good things,\u201d said Josephs, who was watching from the sidelines.\n\n\u201cShe does,\u201d Giudice added. \u201cFrom knowing Danielle in the past, she hasn\u2019t had the best experiences with men. It took awhile to find Marty, but sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. And I\u2019m really, really happy for Danielle.\u201d\n\nStaub and Caffrey have been dating since April 2016. She celebrated their one-year anniversary on Instagram, sharing a selfie of the two and writing, \u201cHere\u2019s to my #first year #anniversary with this cutie \u2026 you are a wonderful man and I\u2019m blessed to have you in my life \u2026 #happyoneyear.\u201d\n\nThe couple haven\u2019t shied away from sharing their relationship on social media, often posting photos together of their romantic date nights.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHONJ\u2018s Danielle Staub Has Forgiven Teresa Guidice for Calling Her a \u2018Prostitution Whore\u2019 8 Years Ago\n\nThis will be the third marriage for Staub. She and her last husband, businessman Thomas N. Staub, split after 14 years together before RHONJ began filming. They share Christine and Jillian together.\n\nStaub\u2019s past relationships were a huge subject of gossip among her fellow New Jersey Housewives on RHONJ \u2014 specifically her first marriage to former FBI informant Kevin Maher, who spoke openly about their past in his biography Cop Without a Badge.\n\nThat book (and the gossip surrounding it) was the catalyst for the show\u2019s most iconic moment when Giudice flipped a table while arguing with Staub during the season 1 finale. The two have made up since and even bonded over a shared love of yoga as they rekindled their friendship.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F02%2Fdanielle-staub.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1517&h=794&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F02%2Fdanielle-staub.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1517&h=794&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F02%2Fdanielle-staub.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/rhonj-danielle-staub-engaged-20th-time-video/", "title": "RHONJ: Danielle Staub Gets Engaged for the 20th Time", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Danielle Staub,Engagement Rings,Engagements,Margaret Josephs,Melissa Gorga,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Teresa Giudice,TV", "news_keywords": "Danielle Staub,Engagement Rings,Engagements,Margaret Josephs,Melissa Gorga,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Teresa Giudice,TV", "description": "Danielle Staub's boyfriend Matt Caffrey popped the question on Wednesday's Real Housewives of New Jersey\u00a0\u201cReunion Secrets Revealed\u201d special", "og": {"title": "WATCH: Danielle Staub Gets Engaged for the 20th Time \u2014 Find Out Which RHONJ Star She Asked to Be a Maid of Honor!", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/rhonj-danielle-staub-engaged-20th-time-video/", "description": "She has famously been engaged 19&nbsp;times before.
