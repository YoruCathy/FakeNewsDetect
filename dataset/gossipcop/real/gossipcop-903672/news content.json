And on Thursday, Justin didn\u2019t disappoint, as he shared the Filthy video and instructed listeners to \u201c(play) very loud\u201d.\n\nIn the video, directed by Mark Romanek, Justin plays a Jobs-type character who takes to the stage at a Pan-Asian Deep Learning Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in the year 2028. Walking up and down the stage in front of the audience, in a similar way to Jobs when he launched a new Apple product, Justin\u2019s character then introduces his latest creation \u2013 a robot that mirrors his movements.\n\nThe clip allows Justin to show off his world-famous dance moves, as he pulls off some fancy footwork which the robot then copies. As the robot continues with the dancing, it begins to get somewhat hands-on with the dancers on stage, moving with them in a provocative manner \u2013 much to the surprise of those in the audience.\n\nThe video ends with Justin\u2019s character \u201cglitching\u201d and his apparition fading away \u2013 suggesting the lines between inventor and invention might be more blurred than viewers first realized.\n\nThe tune itself, which Justin co-wrote with Timbaland, Danja, James Fauntleroy and Larrance Dopson, is a dance-heavy number which features lyrics about hanging out with friends who \u201cain\u2019t leavin\u2019 \u2019til six in the morning\u201d. As he builds up to the chorus, Justin sings: \u201cLook, I said, \u2018Put your filthy hands all over me/ You know, this ain\u2019t the clean version/ And what you gonna do with all that meat?/ Cookin\u2019 up a meat serving.\u201d\n\nThe release of Man of the Woods will come just before Justin takes to the stage for the Super Bowl Halftime Show on 4 February \u2013 14 years after his now-infamous \u201cNipplegate\u201d performance with Janet Jackson.", "images": ["https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/mail_icon.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587216619_383812_65_19846_7.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/files_mf/cache/th_f700d9aae93ebcb0097e9d20cfdd7e7a_1515142807_300329_65_15360_8.jpg", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/839853794603196420/hSPeSenZ_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/tv.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/star-pages.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/top_ad_two.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/right-sidebar-assets/WeeWorld_TaylorLautner_300x250.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587216604_383095_65_19846_19.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/celebritytweets.jpg", "http://static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_171_16.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/favicon.ico", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587248704_385719_65_19847_3.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/top_ad_one.png", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1111938693743419394/98166cns_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/rss_icon.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/left-sidebar-assets/hottips.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/wenn_logo.png", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/842053173757984768/ZYLuzKYt_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587216620_382638_65_19846_23.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/right-sidebar-assets/wennsfriends.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/music.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/mostrecentgalleries.png", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/107763943/twitter_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587164103_380089_65_19845_3.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/news-article-controls/allnews.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/movies.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/tweet_icon.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/news-lit.gif", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/992559243831132161/5PmJrMAg_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587216619_383686_65_19846_3.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/photos.gif"], "top_img": "https://blog.wenn.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://blog.wenn.com/all-news/justin-timberlake-channels-steve-jobs-in-new-filthy-video/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Channels Steve Jobs In New Filthy Video", "meta_data": {"bitly": {"url": "http://j.mp/2CVG3na"}, "og": {"url": "http://j.mp/2CVG3na"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://blog.wenn.com", "summary": ""}
