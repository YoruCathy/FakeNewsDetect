I'm so happy you were born! You bring so much light to my life and to the lives of everyone who knows you. I love you so much! Happy Birthday!!! (sic).\"\n\nHowever, the model was less than impressed by her husband's tribute to her, and slammed the choice of image for the sweet post.\n\nChrissy quipped: \"How about a hi-res (sic)\".\n\nBut Chrissy often teases John on social media, as when the artist attended a baseball match between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium during the 2017 MLB World Series in October, Chrissy took to Twitter to expose him as a bandwagon fan.\n\nShe tweeted: \"*Watches baseball once* #pinotgrigio #grigioboys #chocolatecroissants #baseballfanatics (sic)\"\n\nAlthough Chrissy is pregnant with her second baby she has admitted she cannot wait to have another child and to expand her and John's brood for as long as she can.\n\nSpeaking previously about her family plans, the Sports Illustrated beauty said: \"I feel good, I feel good, we're still trying ... I'm going for I mean hopefully in the next few years because for me I really want to just knock 'em out. That's my dream, I want to just be pregnant kind of for the rest of my life. Not for the rest of my life, but the rest of my fertile life. So we'll see.\"\n\nAnd John has revealed the pair are \"working on\" adding to their family.", "images": ["https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7974418-chrissy-teigen-mocks-john-legend-s-birthday-message/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen mocks John Legend's birthday message", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 200654546635181}, "robots": "index, follow", "description": "John Legend posts heartfelt tribute to wife Chrissy Teigen on her birthday, but Chrissy pokes fun at the sweet gesture.", "og": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen mocks John Legend's birthday message", "url": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7974418-chrissy-teigen-mocks-john-legend-s-birthday-message/", "description": "John Legend posts heartfelt tribute to wife Chrissy Teigen on her birthday, but Chrissy pokes fun at the sweet gesture.", "type": "Article", "site_name": "BramptonGuardian.com", "image": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png"}, "article": {"section": "WhatsOn-Celebrity", "published_time": "2017-12-01T03:00:04Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-01T03:00:04Z"}, "parsely-title": "Chrissy Teigen mocks John Legend's birthday message", "parsely-link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7974418-chrissy-teigen-mocks-john-legend-s-birthday-message/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "http://media.zuza.com/3/d/3dccfef9-670d-4223-a5b7-9da35b3138f2/BS2BS1486793_Image1_Thumbnail.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-12-01T03:00:04Z", "parsely-section": "whatson|celebrity", "parsely-tags": "subcategory:whatson|celebrity,category:whatson,news_source:bangshowbiz,primary_publication:bramptonguardian,video:no,images:1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Communities/bramptonguardian/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512097204.0, "source": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com", "summary": ""}
