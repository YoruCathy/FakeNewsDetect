He said a decision on whether to press charges or not is expected by mid-June.\n\nAnna Forastier, a spokeswoman for auditing firm PwC, said the company has been hired by Shakira for the investigation. Forastier declined to disclose any details.\n\nShakira was named in the \u201cParadise Papers\u201d leaks that detailed the offshore tax arrangements of numerous high-profile individuals, including musical celebrities like Madonna and U2\u2019s Bono.\n\nThe documents obtained by German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and investigated by Spanish news website El Confidencial showed that in 2009 Shakira had relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta, the tiny European Union nation that has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.\n\nShakira and Piqu\u00e9\u2019s relationship dates back to 2011, when Shakira started frequenting Barcelona. El Confidencial, citing papers it obtained from offshore services providers, reported that she listed the Bahamas as her official residence until 2015.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s public knowledge that this is not the case,\u201d Company told The Associated Press.\n\nIf the probe finds wrongdoing, Shakira would join a list of celebrities that have been in trouble with Spanish tax authorities, including footballers Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nIn November, Shakira canceled the first concerts to promote her 11th album, El Dorado, for what she said were medical reasons. The tour is scheduled to begin in June in Germany and then stop in nine more European countries before moving to the United States.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf76e015697b1f8c56c2a40c2537f7c29d3cfc06/c=0-283-5561-3425/local/-/media/2018/01/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636523876722306287-AFP-AFP-K17E8.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf76e015697b1f8c56c2a40c2537f7c29d3cfc06/c=0-283-5561-3425/local/-/media/2018/01/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636523876722306287-AFP-AFP-K17E8.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf76e015697b1f8c56c2a40c2537f7c29d3cfc06/c=0-283-5561-3425/local/-/media/2018/01/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636523876722306287-AFP-AFP-K17E8.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/24/singer-shakira-under-investigation-spain-possible-tax-evasion/1061418001/", "title": "Singer Shakira under investigation in Spain for possible tax evasion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Singer Shakira under investigation in Spain for possible tax evasion", "description": "The singer allegedly failed to pay income tax in Spain while living in Barcelona between 2012 and 2014, before she declared residency there.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/24/singer-shakira-under-investigation-spain-possible-tax-evasion/1061418001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf76e015697b1f8c56c2a40c2537f7c29d3cfc06/c=0-283-5561-3425/local/-/media/2018/01/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636523876722306287-AFP-AFP-K17E8.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The singer allegedly failed to pay income tax in Spain while living in Barcelona between 2012 and 2014, before she declared residency there.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf76e015697b1f8c56c2a40c2537f7c29d3cfc06/c=0-283-5561-3425/local/-/media/2018/01/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636523876722306287-AFP-AFP-K17E8.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Singer Shakira under investigation in Spain for possible tax evasion", "description": "The singer allegedly failed to pay income tax in Spain while living in Barcelona between 2012 and 2014, before she declared residency there."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516723200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
