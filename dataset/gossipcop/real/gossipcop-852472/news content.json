Ben was a quiet homebody and Lauren liked to go out and do things with friends. There are no bad feelings between them -- they just grew apart.\"\n\nJudging by her social media, Bushnell has been coping with the breakup just fine this summer, spending time with gal pals and getting her modeling career going after moving back to Los Angeles.\n\nIn May, Higgins broke his silence on their split in the first episode of his podcast with fellow Bachelor star Ashley Iaconetti, Ben and Ashley: \"Almost Famous,\" and had nothing but good things to say about his ex. Still, he acknowledged that their breakup had been \"a long time coming.\"\n\n\"I think, mutually, Lauren and I saw that life was getting more difficult,\" he said. \"I would say the joy that we felt toward our relationship at the beginning was -- for some reason -- slipping away, and we were both working very hard to bring that joy back. And it just never seemed to get there. So, it was a long time coming, but it wasn't necessarily like we dragged it out.\"\n\nWATCH: A Timeline of All the Signs Lauren Bushnell and Ben Higgins Were Headed Towards a Breakup\n\nLast month, Bushnell also opened up about their engagement coming to an end, admitting that Ben infamously telling both her and Bachelor season 20 runner-up JoJo Fletcher \"I love you\" was an issue for her.\n\n\"I know that JoJo was told what had happened. I almost felt a little bit betrayed,\" she told People.\n\n-- Reporting by Jennifer Peros", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=1000009&c3=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1",
