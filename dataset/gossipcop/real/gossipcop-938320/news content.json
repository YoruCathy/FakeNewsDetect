Someone is always picking their nose, crying or fussing with their dress. Yet royal wedding photographer Alexi Lubomirski managed to nail the perfect shot on Saturday, May 19.\n\nIn the impossibly cute picture, six bridesmaids and four page boys \u2014 all under the age of 8 \u2014 posed around Duchess Meghan (nee Markle) and Prince Harry. But Lubomirski can\u2019t chalk it all up to talent.\n\n\u201cThey were being bribed with one Smartie here, one Smartie there,\u201d the photographer told Reuters in an interview published on Wednesday, May 23. (Smarties in the U.K. aren\u2019t chalky candies, but rather colorful, sugar-coated chocolate confections manufactured by Nestle.)\n\n\u201cAs soon as the kids came onto the set, I immediately just shouted out \u2018Who likes Smarties?\u2019 and then everybody, hands up, smiles, even some adults put up their hands,\u201d recalled Lubomirski. They are certainly a favorite with Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The Telegraph reported that their nanny, Maria Borrallo, promised them Smarties after the ceremony if they behaved!\n\nLubomirski also opened up about capturing the the Duke and Duchess of Sussex laughing on the steps of St. George\u2019s Chapel.\n\n\u201cIt was just one of those magical moments, when you\u2019re a photographer and everything falls into place,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe sun is setting right just over the top of Windsor Castle just behind them, it was just the most serene, beautiful light, they\u2019re in love, walking around this beautiful garden.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he had the idea for them to sit down on the stairs. \u201cShe just slumped in between his legs,\u201d he revealed. \u201cThey were just laughing because they were joking about how they were exhausted and finally it was over.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-photo-diana.jpg?crop=262px%2C383px%2C1715px%2C969px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-photo-diana.jpg?crop=189px%2C391px%2C1811px%2C951px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/960123804_royal-wedding-bridesmaids-page-boys-zoom.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-photo-diana.jpg?crop=189px%2C391px%2C1811px%2C951px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/royal-wedding-photographer-bribed-kids-with-smarties/", "title": "Royal Wedding Photographer Bribed Kids With Smarties", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Royal wedding photographer Alexi Lubomirski bribed Prince George and Princess Charlotte with Smarties at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding\u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Royal Wedding Photographer Bribed the\u00a0Kids With Candy to Get the Perfect Shot", "description": "Royal wedding photographer Alexi Lubomirski bribed Prince George and Princess Charlotte with Smarties at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding\u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/royal-wedding-photographer-bribed-kids-with-smarties/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-23T19:53:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-photo-diana.jpg?crop=189px%2C391px%2C1811px%2C951px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-photo-diana.jpg?crop=189px%2C391px%2C1811px%2C951px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-23T16:37:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-23T19:53:05+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Royal wedding photographer Alexi Lubomirski bribed Prince George and Princess Charlotte with Smarties at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding\u2014 get the details", "title": "Royal Wedding Photographer Bribed the\u00a0Kids With Candy to Get the Perfect Shot", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-photo-diana.jpg?crop=189px%2C391px%2C1811px%2C951px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527093424.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
