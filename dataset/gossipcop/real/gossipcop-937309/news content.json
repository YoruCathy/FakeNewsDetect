Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry were (finally) married in a very royal wedding ceremony on Saturday, which was attended by 600 invited guests, a ton of members of the public, and, oh, just an estimated 1.9 billion people watching worldwide.\n\nAfterward, the newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex celebrated their nuptials away from the cameras during a private lunch for the invited ceremony guests. Then, there was another private evening reception for 200 close friends and family, hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House on the Windsor estate. Thankfully for those of us who (for some reason) were not on the guest list, reports about what went down at the exclusive affairs have emerged.\n\nWhat Does It Take To Be A Duchess? Inside A Royal Etiquette Class\n\nDuring the lunch, Prince Harry reportedly gushed about Meghan in a speech.\n\nAfter the ceremony, guests of the fancy nuptials headed to a lunch reception. There, Prince Harry reported gave an emotional speech, during which he professed his love and admiration for his new wife. According to the Sun, Prince Harry told Meghan (and the room) that they make \u201cgreat team.\u201d He added that she \u201cnavigated everything with such grace,\u201d and then said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d Oh, we know.\n\nThe couple after the wedding ceremony.

The Mirror notes that Prince Charles spoke of the man his \u201cdarling old Harry\u201d had grown into, but he also cracked a joke about changing Prince Harry\u2019s diapers as a kid. One guest told the Daily Mail, \u201cPrince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u2019s got a wonderfully dry sense of humor.\u201d\n\nGuests got to swap their heels for slippers.\n\nPretty Little Liars star Troian Bellisario, who is married to Meghan\u2019s Suits onscreen husband Patrick J. Adams, showed on Instagram that guests at the afternoon reception were given very fancy slippers to change into if their heels were hurting them. How thoughtful.\n\nTroian Bellisario showing the slippers people were given.

Baker Claire Ptak shared a pic of the cake on social media.\n\nThen, guests (and also Meghan and Prince Harry) changed before the evening reception.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen (and memorized) pictures of Meghan and Prince Harry in their evening reception attire (for reference, look at the pic above). Meghan swapped her Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy ceremony gown for a minimal Stella McCartney dress for the party, while Prince Harry donned a fancy tuxedo. The pair drove off to Frogmore House in a Jaguar convertible.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex depart Windsor Castle for a reception hosted by The Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero.

Luckily, some of the VIP guests (and the people working with them) posted their outfit changes on social media.\n\nSerena Williams, one of the greatest athletes of all time, revealed that she changed into a Valentino gown \u2014 with sneakers underneath for maximum comfort (smart):\n\nPriyanka Chopra changed into a Dior gown:\n\nJessica Mulroney \u2014 Meghan\u2019s best friend, a Canadian stylist, the (secret) wedding planner, and the mother of two of the royal wedding pageboys and an adorable bridesmaid \u2014 also changed into something fancy (and glittery):\n\nBen and Jessica Mulroney.

Photo: nachofigueras/Instagram\n\nThe evening reception was more of a party.\n\nThe private reception at Frogmore House was much more of a party than the more formal lunch reception at Windsor Castle following the ceremony. We had already heard that Prince Harry reportedly wanted a \u201ccarnival and festival-themed\u201d after-party reminiscent of his favorite London night clubs, complete with vodka-filled ice luges, Wagyu beef, a steel band, and frozen tropical drinks. And according to a report by Daily Mail, it sounds like he had just that.\n\nThe after-party at Frogmore apparently featured DJ Sam Totolee, who also played at Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding last May (during which he apparently played \u201cI Took a Pill In Ibiza). Meghan and Prince Harry reportedly had their first dance to Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody.\u201d Prince William is said to have given a \u201cnaughty\u201d best man speech, Meghan gave a speech thanking the royal family for welcoming her, and there was some \u201cunknown\u201d gift from James Corden (who is said to have been the host and entertainer for the evening).\n\nThere was also an organic sit down dinner that apparently lasted from 7:30 to 10 p.m. And the event did, in fact, have a specialty cocktail (at, least including to a Daily Mail source): a drink called \u201cWhen Harry Met Meghan,\u201d made with ginger and rum.\n\nAnd eventually, there were fireworks.\n\nOf course! The fireworks apparently went down at 11 p.m.\n\nThen there was apparently another after-party in London.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports guests from the 200-person reception in Windsor later returned to London to continue the celebration at the exclusive Chiltern Firehouse restaurant. There was also reportedly a different party in a \u201csoundproofed private home\u201d in Chelsea as well.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/20/GettyImages-960174034.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d11/902/312105a5406ffb3d7252b421c7f57eb8bc-IMG-1361.w710.png", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/20/GettyImages-960174034.w330.h412.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fcc/fd1/7d066c059a17d3d72ae20d4c5199720c84-IMG-1364.w710.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ad1/0de/98a84b48f0ed66241059ae8ab3e48a58f4-IMG-1360.h473.w710.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/733/45a/670c3611447c31cc71c8730471c6f0c3d9-19-harry-meghan-3.h473.w710.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/20/GettyImages-960174034.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-wedding-reception.html", "title": "Inside Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s Royal Wedding Reception", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Inside Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s Private Royal Wedding Reception", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-wedding-reception.html", "description": "Everything we know about the afternoon lunch and exclusive evening party.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/20/GettyImages-960174034.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Inside Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s Royal Wedding Reception", "description": "Everything we know about the afternoon lunch and exclusive evening party.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/20/GettyImages-960174034.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@lisarya", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-20T11:24:06.817-04:00", "tag": "royal wedding 2.0, meghan markle, prince harry, culture, celebrity", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married on Saturday in a very royal wedding, followed by a lunch reception and an exclusive evening party.
