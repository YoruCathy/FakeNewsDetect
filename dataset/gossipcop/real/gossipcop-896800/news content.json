Though they have both worn some memorable ensembles, it looks like Markle may have had a bigger year than her royal sister-in-law when it comes to influencing the latest trends.\n\nBoth duchesses made it onto global fashion search platform Lyst's new ranking of the most powerful celebrity fashion influencers of the year, with Markle landing in a higher spot on the list than Middleton.\n\nThe list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence. Kylie Jenner nabbed the top spot on the list, followed by her sister Kim Kardashian West.\n\nMarkle was found to be the third most popular celebrity fashion influencer of 2018\n\nBoat neck dresses have become one of Markle's signature styles.

People were also searching for \"boat neck\" and \"tuxedo dress\" designs.\n\nRead more: Meghan Markle keeps wearing dresses with the same neckline \u2014 and it's quickly becoming one of her signature looks\n\nSearches for Stella McCartney were up after Markle's wedding reception.

The coat was actually first seen in 2014, proving that her penchant for outfit recycling still maintains its influence.\n\nRead more: 35 stunning looks Kate Middleton repeats again and again\n\nMiddleton's bright pink coat was a huge hit. Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images\n\nA Brand Finance survey from back in October named Middleton as the most popular royal influencer of the year, so results seem to vary based on the data. It's also worth noting that Middleton was out on royal maternity leave for much of the year after giving birth to Prince Louis in April, so she debuted fewer new looks than Markle.\n\nEither way, both duchesses seem to be providing fashion inspiration in their own way.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5b7ec86a3cccd120008b459c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b86fb5a3cccd11a008b45b8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5bf4460348eb1202ae0a3de2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5bf445f248eb123f4145f282?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5bf43d1e48eb1238b0154bb5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5bf445f248eb123f4145f282?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5bec3d6e48eb1201042cc912?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5bf43e3248eb123dae54dd72?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-fashion-influence-2018-11?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5bf4460348eb1202ae0a3de2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Boan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-fashion-influence-2018-11", "title": "Meghan Markle officially overtakes Kate Middleton as the most powerful royal fashion influencer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Meghan Markle officially overtakes Kate Middleton as the most powerful royal fashion influencer", "date": "2018-11-20", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Royal Family, kate middleton, Lyst, Fashion, INSIDER newsletter, Daniel Boan", "description": "According to a new Lyst ranking, Meghan Markle is the third most powerful celebrity fashion influencer of the year.", "author": "Daniel Boan", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Lifestyle", "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle officially overtakes Kate Middleton as the most powerful royal fashion influencer", "description": "According to a new Lyst ranking, Meghan Markle is the third most powerful celebrity fashion influencer of the year.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-fashion-influence-2018-11", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5bf4460348eb1202ae0a3de2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Meghan Markle officially overtakes Kate Middleton as the most powerful royal fashion influencer", "sailthru.date": "2018-11-20", "sailthru.tags": "Meghan Markle, Royal Family, kate middleton, Lyst, Fashion, INSIDER newsletter, Daniel Boan", "sailthru.description": "According to a new Lyst ranking, Meghan Markle is the third most powerful celebrity fashion influencer of the year.", "sailthru.author": "Daniel Boan", "sailthru.verticals": "lifestyle", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5bf445f248eb123f4145f282?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5bf445f248eb123f4145f282?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "Meghan Markle officially overtakes Kate Middleton as the most powerful royal fashion influencer": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"bi8-lazy-load": 250, "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "variant", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "5bf441a848eb1206ea2f7616", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542643200.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
