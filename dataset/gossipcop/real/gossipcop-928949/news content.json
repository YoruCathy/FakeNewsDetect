He was asleep when police investigating the case found him.\n\nThe man, 22-year-old Roger Alvardo, was charged with stalking, burglary, criminal mischief and trespassing, according to the NYPD.\n\nAccording to the Daily News, which first reported the break-in, it wasn't Alvardo's first arrest at Swift's home. He was also reportedly arrested for trying to break into the Franklin Street townhouse with a shovel in February.\n\nAlvardo's arrest Friday marks the fourth time in three weeks a man had been cuffed at one of the \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" singer's properties.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Colorado man wearing a mask and rubber gloves was cuffed outside her home in Beverly Hills. In that instance, the man was arrested on stalking charges and had a knife, rope, ammunition, more masks and gloves and prescription drugs in the car. Swift wasn't home at the time.\n\nThat incident followed the April 8 arrest of a homeless man on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to climb a wall at the same property and ignored warnings by security guards to leave.\n\nAnd on April 4, authorities said a Connecticut man with a crush on the singer allegedly robbed a bank and went to her Rhode Island mansion and threw the money he stole over a fence in an attempt to impress her.", "images": ["https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/GettyImages-1219262470.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1024px%2C576px&resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/d5d969291b5a4e0e92b28ede3c2f2fe9.jpeg.jpg?resize=1200%2C675", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/goodnews2-apr17.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_On_Dark@3x-2.png?fit=132%2C120", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_On_Light@3x.png?fit=132%2C120"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/d5d969291b5a4e0e92b28ede3c2f2fe9.jpeg.jpg?resize=1200%2C675", "keywords": [], "authors": ["R.
