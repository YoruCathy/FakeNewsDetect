It's a visual that begins with all the jazz surrounding romantic connection and ends with an unexpected pregnancy, which mirrors the bars to the collab. \"My personal life is not exactly a highlight reel,\" Eminem says at the start of the clip when he's asked what love means to him. Sheeran appears sporadically throughout the clip, but the main character of this video is the crumbling connection between Em and his fictional lover.\n\nIt's clear that Slim Shady's unfortunate tale of romance in \"River\" goes along with his brand. \"Unhappy Valentine's day! #River Music Video ft. @edsheeran WEDNESDAY,\" he tweeted earlier this week ahead of the video release. \"River\" is the second single from his recently-released LP, Revival. Scroll on below to see just how poorly things pan out for Eminem's on-screen romance.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e7b5ddfbee47a8a2b39605d?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Iheartradio Editorial Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-02-14-eminem-returns-to-acting-in-his-video-for-river-featuring-ed-sheeran/", "title": "Eminem Returns To Acting In His Video For 'River' Featuring Ed Sheeran", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'River' is the second single from his recently-released 'Revival'", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "new york, nyc, ktu, 103.5, 103, Eminem (36639), Ed Sheeran (396790), new york, nyc, ktu, 103.5, 103, Eminem (36639), Ed Sheeran (396790)", "og": {"title": "Eminem Returns To Acting In His Video For 'River' Featuring Ed Sheeran | 103.5 KTU", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2018-02-14-eminem-returns-to-acting-in-his-video-for-river-featuring-ed-sheeran/", "description": "'River' is the second single from his recently-released 'Revival'", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "103.5 KTU"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2018-02-14-eminem-returns-to-acting-in-his-video-for-river-featuring-ed-sheeran/", "site": "@1035KTU", "creator": "@1035KTU", "title": "Eminem Returns To Acting In His Video For 'River' Featuring Ed Sheeran | 103.5 KTU", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "'River' is the second single from his recently-released 'Revival'", "domain": "ktu.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Eminem Returns To Acting In His Video For 'River' Featuring Ed Sheeran | 103.5 KTU", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-02-14-eminem-returns-to-acting-in-his-video-for-river-featuring-ed-sheeran/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "new york, nyc, ktu, 103.5, 103, Eminem (36639), Ed Sheeran (396790), new york, nyc, ktu, 103.5, 103, Eminem (36639), Ed Sheeran (396790)", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a8483194b4ae25071598b43?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "103.5 KTU", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "fb": {"pages": 120727317966271, "app_id": 409625425402}, "parsely-pub-date": "2018-02-14T18:45:00.000Z", "parsely-author": "iHeartRadio Editorial Team", "parsely-section": "trending-urban"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518537600.0, "source": "https://ktu.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
