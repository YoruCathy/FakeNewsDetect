I think people need to realize that,\u201d Underwood continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake, you live and you learn, and Garrett has definitely learned from this.\u201d\n\nThough Kufrin, 28, and Yrigoyen aren\u2019t rushing to the altar, Underwood is hopeful to find a happy ending of his own on this season of \u201cBachelor in Paradise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think coming off [\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019], I realized how cool and fun of an experience that was, it was such a good time of my life to self-discover and grow as a person, and I wanted to continue that and to continue to find love,\u201d he said.\n\nWith former flame and \u201cBachelor\u201d alum Tia Booth in \u201cParadise,\u201d too, Underwood called the time in Mexico an emotional experience.\n\n\u201cWhen I say emotional, I not only mean sad, but obviously in the teaser [trailer] where I was crying, but happy, confused, it\u2019s just a lot of emotions that came out. Overall, it was a good learning and growing experience for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d airs Mondays and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on ABC.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/colton-becca-garret-engagement.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/colton-becca-garret-engagement.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/colton-becca-garret-engagement.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/08/12/bachelorette-alum-colton-underwood-addresses-controversial-winner/", "title": "\u2018Bachelorette\u2019 alum Colton Underwood addresses controversial winner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
