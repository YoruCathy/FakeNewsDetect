Miley Cyrus and a dog.\n\nAnd they did, in this gushingly cute video of Chris Hemsworth jamming out to Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" before being tackled by his dog and kids.\n\nHemsworth faces his back to the camera in his self-described \"ground breaking music video,\" swaying side to side with his hands in the air.\n\nThen he jumps to face forward, mouthing the pop-hit lyrics. But the very good pup (who was just a little hyper and jumpy) had enough.\n\nHemsworth falls to the ground but continues his performance as the dog starts barking and the kids totally go off and do their own dance moves.\n\nHe captioned the post:\n\n\"What started as a ground breaking music video ended in a savage attack by a cowardly K9. Never work with Kids or Animals..\"\n\nSo basically, just another day in the life of a dad.\n\nLike All the Moms?\n\nFollow us on Facebook.\n\nREAD MORE:", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f6389b6311a4b34c0309a772fce88e0277f322f/c=0-221-4796-2931/local/-/media/2018/04/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636601771663237493-day03.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f6389b6311a4b34c0309a772fce88e0277f322f/c=0-221-4796-2931/local/-/media/2018/04/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636601771663237493-day03.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f6389b6311a4b34c0309a772fce88e0277f322f/c=0-221-4796-2931/local/-/media/2018/04/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636601771663237493-day03.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/05/25/chris-hemsworth-dancing-miley-cyrus-hysterical/645028002/", "title": "Chris Hemsworth hysterically dancing to 'Wrecking Ball' for his kids will crack you up", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Chris Hemsworth hysterically dancing to 'Wrecking Ball' for his kids will crack you up", "description": "Chris Hemsworth hysterically dancing to Miley Cyrus song 'Wrecking Ball' before being tackled to the ground by his dog and kids will light up your day", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/05/25/chris-hemsworth-dancing-miley-cyrus-hysterical/645028002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f6389b6311a4b34c0309a772fce88e0277f322f/c=0-221-4796-2931/local/-/media/2018/04/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636601771663237493-day03.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Taylor Seely and Taylor Seely", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Chris Hemsworth hysterically dancing to Miley Cyrus song 'Wrecking Ball' before being tackled to the ground by his dog and kids will light up your day", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f6389b6311a4b34c0309a772fce88e0277f322f/c=0-221-4796-2931/local/-/media/2018/04/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636601771663237493-day03.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Chris Hemsworth hysterically dancing to 'Wrecking Ball' for his kids will crack you up", "description": "Chris Hemsworth hysterically dancing to Miley Cyrus song 'Wrecking Ball' before being tackled to the ground by his dog and kids will light up your day"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527177600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
