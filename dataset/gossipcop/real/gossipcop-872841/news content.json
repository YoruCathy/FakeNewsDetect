Now there are rumors that Pitt is moving on with his life by dating. But someone he has been rumored to be dating said publicly that isn\u2019t true. So what exactly is going on with the newly single actor?\n\nThat\u2019s hard to figure out, given the father has been purposely laying low, but we decided to find out the latest. Here are seven things we know about how the actor is moving on after the divorce, in both his professional life and dating life.\n\n1. Brad Pitt is reportedly dating again\n\nBrad Pitt isn\u2019t all work and no play. | Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Image Brad Pitt isn\u2019t all work and no play. | Alberto E.

A source told People that Pitt \u201chas been dating a bit.\u201d\n\nThe source continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not anything serious\u201d and \u201che doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend. It\u2019s more of a way to get out and be social.\u201d The dates are also reportedly not that intimate. \u201cHe seems more comfortable double-dating and friends are helping out.\u201d\n\n2.

According to People, Pitt and Oxman connected over their shared love of design and architecture. At the time, the publication reported Pitt is \u201cinterested in spending more time\u201d with Oxman, although it\u2019s unclear if they meant in a romantic or platonic capacity.\n\n4.

But in August 2017, TMZ reported that the two were still planning on moving forward with the divorce by planning child custody and property settlements.\n\nAccording to E! News, that still seems to be the case, although Pitt is reportedly hoping to rework some of the details surrounding the couple\u2019s current custody agreement, which only allows him visitation rights.\n\n\u201d [Angelina and Brad] are still working out the divorce and the custody details,\u201d a source told the publication. \u201cBrad isn\u2019t happy about the custody arrangement.
