An investigation is being conducted.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThough authorities could not disclose the name of the individual who submitted the report, Schuman shared a tweet that same day that read: \u201cI\u2019m finally doing what I thought I could no longer do. I\u2019m filing a police report #timesup #bebrave #bethechange #metoo thank you @RAINN [the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network] for empowering me to take this step.\u201d\n\nA rep for Carter did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn November, Schuman, now 33, detailed the alleged incident on her personal blog, claiming that Carter had raped her in the early 2000s when she was 18 and he was 22.\n\nImage zoom Aaron Carter; Melissa Schuman Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty; Matthew Simmons/Getty\n\nCarter, now 38, responded to the allegations in November with an exclusive statement to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cI am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman\u2019s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally,\u201d the Backstreet Boys band member said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Backstreet Boy Nick Carter \u2018Shocked and Saddened\u2019 by Rape Allegations\n\nThat same month, Schuman told PEOPLE in a statement that she felt she needed to come forward with her story.\n\n\u201cI was empowered to share my story because of the brave women who shared their stories before me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is that my experience further highlights the urgent need for open dialogue and education about consent and sexual assault.

And I was told that [Carter] had the most powerful litigator in the country and that I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for an attorney to essentially defend me, if he were to come after me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy manager told me, \u2018You know you\u2019re trying to build a name for yourself right now, everyone\u2019s going to call you fame hungry, that you\u2019re trying to use this to better yourself or get your name out there and at this point there\u2019s nothing we can do,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI remember telling him, \u2018Oh, so that\u2019s it\u2026 he just gets away with it?!\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fnick-carter-melissa-schuman-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fnick-carter-melissa-schuman-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fnick-carter-melissa-schuman-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/nick-carter-rape-accuser-melissa-schuman-files-police-report/", "title": "Nick Carter's Rape Accuser Melissa Schuman Files Police Report, Investigation Underway", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Backstreet Boys,Music News,News,Nick Carter,Sexual Assault", "news_keywords": "Backstreet Boys,Music News,News,Nick Carter,Sexual Assault", "description": "The Santa Monica Police Department confirms to PEOPLE that a complaint against Nick Carter was filed", "og": {"title": "Nick Carter's Rape Accuser Melissa Schuman Files Police Report, Investigation Underway", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/nick-carter-rape-accuser-melissa-schuman-files-police-report/", "description": "Melissa Schuman, the former teen pop singer who accused&nbsp;Nick Carter of rape, has filed a police report.
