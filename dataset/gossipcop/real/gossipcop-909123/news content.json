Um, maybe coveralls so you protect your clothes?\n\nChristian Grey: I could just take all my clothes off.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Okay, no clothes. I mean, no coveralls. You, I can\u2019t really think of anything else.\n\nChristian Grey: Well, I guess that\u2019s it then.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Cool.\n\n[at the cash register Ana bags up Christian\u2019s things]\n\nAnastasia Steele: Thank you for answering Kate\u2019s questions by the way, she was thrilled.\n\nChristian Grey: Well I hope she\u2019s feeling better.\n\nAnastasia Steele: She is, yeah, much.

You wouldn\u2019t understand.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Enlighten me then.\n\n[he touches her face tenderly, he leans in to kiss her but stops himself and instead walks into the bathroom]\n\n[Ana walks out of the bathroom wearing the clothes Taylor had bought her]\n\nChristian Grey: You look beautiful.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Taylor has good taste.\n\nChristian Grey: What are you doing later?\n\nAnastasia Steele: I\u2019m working at the hardware store till seven.\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019ll have Taylor pick you up then.\n\n[Ana bites her lip and looks down]\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019d like to bite that lip.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I think I\u2019d like that too.\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019m not going to touch you, not until I have your written consent.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What?\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019ll explain later. Come, I\u2019ll take you home.\n\n[Christian and Ana enter the elevator, he sees Ana bite her lip again]\n\nChristian Grey: Fuck the paperwork.\n\n[he suddenly takes a hold of Ana and kisses her passionately, just as they are getting into it the elevator doors open and a group of business men enter, Christian looks at Ana]\n\nChristian Grey: What is it about elevators?\n\n[Ana smiles]\n\n[Ana and Christian enter her apartment to find Elliot and Kate naked on the couch, Elliot gets up to get dressed]\n\nElliot Grey: Hey.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Hey.\n\nElliot Grey: Hi, you must be Ana.\n\n[they shake hands]\n\nAnastasia Steele: You must be Elliot.\n\nElliot Grey: And we must be going, Elliot.\n\n[to Ana]\n\nElliot Grey: So awesome to meet you.

We\u2019re starting with you. If you\u2019re seeing him again tonight, that means that something happened. Ana?\n\n[Ana avoids answering and starts to walk away]\n\nAnastasia Steele: I have to get ready for work.\n\n[they both laugh]\n\nAnastasia Steele: We just kissed. Once.\n\nKate: Only once? That\u2019s odd.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Mm. Odd doesn\u2019t even cover it.\n\nKate: Uh-huh.\n\n[Ana turns and starts walking to her room]\n\nKate: And a new jacket. Hm.\n\n[after finishing work, Ana walks out of the store to see Taylor waiting for her]\n\nAnastasia Steele: Hi. It\u2019s Taylor, right?\n\nTaylor: Good evening, Miss Steele.

It means that you cannot discuss anything about us with anyone. I\u2019m afraid my lawyer insists on it.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I\u2019d never talk to anyone about us anyway.\n\n[Ana signs the agreement]\n\nAnastasia Steele: Are you going to make love to me now?\n\nChristian Grey: Two things: First, I don\u2019t make love. I fuck, hard.\n\nAnastasia Steele: And the second thing?\n\nChristian Grey: Come.\n\n[he holds out his hand for Ana to take]\n\n[Christian escorts Ana towards a room]\n\nChristian Grey: It\u2019s just around this door.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What is?\n\nChristian Grey: My playroom.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Like your Xbox and stuff?\n\nChristian Grey: It\u2019s important that you know that you can leave at any time.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Why? What\u2019s in there?\n\nChristian Grey: I meant what I said. The helicopter is on standby to take you whenever you want to go.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Christian, just open the door.\n\n[he unlocks the door, as they step inside Ana is visibly shocked at what she sees]\n\nAnastasia Steele: Oh, my God.\n\n[the room is filled with BDSM stuff like ropes, chains, whips and floggers]\n\n[Ana touches one of the floggers]\n\nChristian Grey: It\u2019s called a flogger.\n\n[Ana walks silently to touch another item]\n\nChristian Grey: Say something, please.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Do women do this to you or do you\u2026?\n\nChristian Grey: I do this to women. With women. Women who want me to.\n\nAnastasia Steele: You\u2019re a sadist?\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019m a dominant.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What does that mean?\n\nChristian Grey: It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Why would I do that?\n\nChristian Grey: To please me.\n\nAnastasia Steele: To please you? How?\n\nChristian Grey: I have rules, if you follow them, I\u2019ll reward you. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll punish you.\n\nAnastasia Steele: You\u2019d punish me, like you\u2019d use this stuff on me?\n\nChristian Grey: Yes.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What would I get out of this?\n\nChristian Grey: Me.\n\n[Christian escorts Ana to another room]\n\nChristian Grey: If we were to do this, this would be your room. You can decorate it however you like.\n\nAnastasia Steele: You want me to move in?\n\nChristian Grey: Not full-time, just Friday through to Sunday. We can negotiate the particulars.\n\nAnastasia Steele: So, I, so, I\u2019d sleep in here with you?\n\nChristian Grey: No, I\u2019d be downstairs. I told you I don\u2019t sleep with anyone.\n\n[Christian escorts Ana downstairs]\n\nAnastasia Steele: What if I don\u2019t want anything to do with that?\n\nChristian Grey: I would understand completely.\n\nAnastasia Steele: But then we wouldn\u2019t have any sort of relationship at all?\n\nChristian Grey: This is the only sort of relationship I have.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Why?\n\nChristian Grey: It\u2019s the way I am.\n\nAnastasia Steele: When you said negotiate, what did you mean?\n\nChristian Grey: I already have a contract prepared. It\u2019s fairly detailed. You would review it and we would negotiate what you are and are not willing to try.\n\nAnastasia Steele: How could I know what I\u2019d be willing to try?\n\nChristian Grey: Well when you\u2019ve had sex, was there anything you didn\u2019t like doing? We have to be honest with each other for this to work, okay?\n\n[Ana down in embarrassment]\n\nAnastasia Steele: I wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nChristian Grey: What do you mean?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Because I haven\u2019t, I haven\u2019t\u2026\n\nChristian Grey: You\u2019re still a virgin? I\u2019ve just shown you\u2026\n\nAnastasia Steele: I know, I just\u2026\n\nChristian Grey: You\u2019ve done other things, right?\n\nAnastasia Steele: No.\n\n[Christian touches her face tenderly]\n\nChristian Grey: Where have you been?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Waiting.\n\nChristian Grey: Men must throw themselves at you.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Never what I\u2019ve wanted.\n\n[Ana looks down, biting on her lip]\n\nChristian Grey: You\u2019re biting your lip.\n\n[he kisses her]\n\nAnastasia Steele: What are you doing?\n\nChristian Grey: Rectifying the situation.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I\u2019m a situation?\n\n[he takes Ana to his bedroom, slowly undresses, kisses her and proceeds to have sex with her; later Ana wakes when she hears Christian playing the piano downstairs, Ana goes over to him, they start kissing, he picks her up and takes her back to the bedroom]\n\n[the next morning Christian walks in on Ana dancing as she fixes breakfast, startling her]\n\nChristian Grey: You\u2019re energetic this morning.\n\nAnastasia Steele: You hungry?\n\nChristian Grey: Very.\n\n[Ana smiles]\n\nAnastasia Steele: Cause I\u2019m making pancakes.\n\n[after eating breakfast Christian kisses Ana\u2019s hand]\n\nChristian Grey: Let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\n\n[in the bathroom Ana shyly undresses and they have a bath together]\n\n[after bathing together Christian kisses Ana]\n\nChristian Grey: Do you trust me?\n\n[Christian removes the towel from Ana\u2019s body and let\u2019s down her hair]\n\nChristian Grey: Stay here.\n\n[he goes to his closet and gets one of his ties]\n\nChristian Grey: Hold out your wrists.\n\n[Ana holds out her wrists, Christian ties them together with his tie then drops her onto his bed, with her arms above her head as he lies on top of her]\n\nChristian Grey: Hold them there, understand?\n\n[Ana smiles at him]\n\nChristian Grey: Tell me you understand.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I won\u2019t move my arms.\n\nChristian Grey: Good girl.\n\n[as Christian moves gently down her body, Ana moves her arms but Christian quickly pushes them over head again]\n\nChristian Grey: Stay still.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Okay.\n\n[Christian moves down her body again]\n\nChristian Grey: Say yes.\n\nAnastasia Steele: To what?\n\nChristian Grey: To being mine.\n\n[just as he\u2019s about to go down on her Christian\u2019s adoptive mother, Grace, calls out]\n\nMrs. Grey: Christian!\n\nChristian Grey: Shit.

I promise you.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Would we still go out to dinner, and movies and\u2026?\n\nChristian Grey: That\u2019s not really my thing.

We slept in the same bed last night, like normal people.\n\nChristian Grey: Try not to get hung up on the sleeping arrangements. If you agree to do this, you\u2019re going to want your own room.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Why, cause I\u2019ll be your sex slave?\n\nChristian Grey: I don\u2019t want to do this here, let\u2019s talk downstairs.\n\nAnastasia Steele: No. You know what, I think I\u2019ll hold on to my freewill a little while longer, thank you.

I was fifteen.\n\nAnastasia Steele: She seduced you?\n\nChristian Grey: I was her submissive for six years.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Seriously? Does your mother know that?\n\nChristian Grey: Of course not. No one in my family knows about this part of me.\n\nAnastasia Steele: So she introduced you to all this? Mrs. Robinson?\n\nChristian Grey: Mrs. Robinson. I\u2019ll tell her you said that, she\u2019ll love it.\n\nAnastasia Steele: You still talk to her?\n\nChristian Grey: On occasions.
