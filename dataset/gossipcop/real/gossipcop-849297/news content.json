Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after less than four years of marriage, Us Weekly can confirm.\n\nAccording to E! News, the Polish-American model, 38, and the handsome entrepreneur have been separated since December. \u201cThey just grew apart,\u201d a source told the outlet.\n\nThe former couple\u2019s often rocky romance was featured on Bravo\u2019s The Real Housewives of Miami, which ended after three seasons in 2013. Though they once called off their engagement after an explosive fight over cheating rumors, they eventually tied the knot in June 2013. The romantic California ceremony, which Krupa\u2019s rep described to Us Weekly as \u201ca million-dollar princess wedding,\u201d was featured on the reality series.\n\nMonths after getting hitched, Krupa told Us that she wanted to start a family with Zago, and revealed that she had thought about freezing her eggs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking more and more about it. Honestly, [one second] I want to have a baby and [then] another second I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m ready for it just yet. So what I think I\u2019m gonna do \u2014 unless it happens naturally \u2014 I think I\u2019m gonna freeze my eggs in the next month or two,\u201d she shared with Us during a January 2014 interview. \u201cI wish I did that in my twenties but, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t. So I think I\u2019m gonna do it just in case because every year I\u2019m like, \u2018This is the year, this is the year.\u2019 But I\u2019m still focused on other things that it\u2019s just really hard, and I don\u2019t want to take it away from being a mother.\u201d\n\nAside from her dream of becoming a mother, the blonde beauty \u2014 who lives in Los Angeles \u2014 also opened up to Us about the challenges of maintaining a bi-coastal marriage with Zago, who is based in Miami. \u201cWe both have such busy lives. The Real Housewives of Miami only shows my life in Miami and, to be honest, my life is more L.A. The only thing that keeps me in Miami is my husband,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 I think we\u2019re like the only couple that\u2019s been doing a bi-coastal relationship for seven years.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/176460907_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-dc6ebbfd-7891-4218-864d-75b9903e4e38.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/186114572_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-2007c03b-7197-4825-8e49-f8e3a2662fb7.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/176460907_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-1ae14031-f33e-4f0d-bdac-dd80ef924d53.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/176460907_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-dc6ebbfd-7891-4218-864d-75b9903e4e38.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joanna-krupa-and-romain-zago-split-after-less-than-four-years-of-marriage-w481327/", "title": "Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago Split After Less Than Four Years of Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after less than four years of marriage, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago Split After Less Than Four Years of Marriage", "description": "Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after less than four years of marriage, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joanna-krupa-and-romain-zago-split-after-less-than-four-years-of-marriage-w481327/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:08:06+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/176460907_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-dc6ebbfd-7891-4218-864d-75b9903e4e38.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/176460907_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-dc6ebbfd-7891-4218-864d-75b9903e4e38.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-05-08T21:05:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:08:06+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after less than four years of marriage, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 read more", "title": "Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago Split After Less Than Four Years of Marriage", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/176460907_romain-zago-joanna-krupa-zoom-dc6ebbfd-7891-4218-864d-75b9903e4e38.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494277500.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
