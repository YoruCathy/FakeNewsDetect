If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p\u2014-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f\u2014ing with me and mine!\u201d Leakes wrote in the comments section.\n\n\u201cGo somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn\u2019t even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,\u201d she concluded.\n\nA rep for Bravo had no comment.\n\nImage zoom Instagram\n\nAlso on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a \u201cblack roach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling BLACK people roaches! I found a roach in NENEs home! not calling her a roach dumb f\u2014. doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re black, white, hispanic, asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u don\u2019t f\u2014ing clean ur s\u2014!!! #callorkinpls,\u201d the eldest Biermann child wrote.\n\nImage zoom Instagram\n\nThen, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo \u201cracists.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,\u201d Leakes wrote, adding, \u201cchildren are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.\u201d\n\nZolciak-Biermann, 39, told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cFirst off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM\u2019s blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!\u201d the mother of six wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cBrielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann concluded.\n\nIn a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that\u2019s her last resort. (It\u2019s convenient that I\u2019m not racist when we are getting along.),\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it\u2019s heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she\u2019s upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZ4uXGLHKH9/?taken-by=neneleakes\n\nLater, Leakes retorted Zolciak-Biermann\u2019s post with another statement of her own.\n\n\u201cKim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim\u2019s household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree\u2019s plus 1. She is a huge lier,\u201d Leakes wrote.\n\n\u201cAll this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go! Then she turns around an try to get the fans on her side of this s\u2014 #trash.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nThe drama escalated yet again after fellow RHOA cast member Kenya Moore also commented on the Leakes-Biermann feud.\n\n\u201c@neneleakes I totally agree with you about that devil,\u201d Moore said in her repost of Leakes\u2019 airplane selfie, along with the hashtags #sheisabadperson #youliedabouthavingcancer #likemotherlikedaughter #youpimpedyourdaughter #youbroughtyourkidsintothis #closeyourlegstomarriedmen.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, which was pre-recorded, Zolciak-Biermann had nice things to say about Leakes.\n\n\u201cI love [NeNe] always will, we started together so,\u201d she said before news of their feud went public, later adding: \u201cNeNe, Kim and Shere\u00e9 [Whitfield] have a major connection. There was a lot of drama there.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta premieres Nov. 5 (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Freal-housewives-kim-nene-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Freal-housewives-kim-nene-3-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Freal-housewives-kim-nene-31-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/nene-leakes-slams-kim-zolciak-biermann-brielle-biermann-racist/", "title": "NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Biermann Over Daughter's Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar 'Racist'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brielle Biermann,Kim Zolciak Biermann,NeNe Leakes,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta,TV", "news_keywords": "Brielle Biermann,Kim Zolciak Biermann,NeNe Leakes,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta,TV", "description": "NeNe Leakes and Brielle Biermann\u00a0feuded over claims of \u201cprejudice\u201d after the 20-year-old visited Leakes' home and allegedly found cockroaches", "og": {"title": "NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Biermann Over Daughter's Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar 'Racist'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nene-leakes-slams-kim-zolciak-biermann-brielle-biermann-racist/", "description": "NeNe Leakes is slamming Real Housewives of Atlanta costar&nbsp;Kim Zolciak-Biermann\u2018s daughter Brielle Biermann&nbsp;over claims of \u201cprejudice\u201d after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes\u2019 home and allegedly&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/nene-leakes-slams-kim-zolciak-biermann-brielle-biermann-racist/", "description": "NeNe Leakes and Brielle Biermann\u00a0feuded over claims of \u201cprejudice\u201d after the 20-year-old visited Leakes' home and allegedly found cockroaches", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nene-leakes-slams-kim-zolciak-biermann-brielle-biermann-racist/", "title": "NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Biermann Over Daughter's Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar 'Racist'", "description": "NeNe Leakes and Brielle Biermann\u00a0feuded over claims of \u201cprejudice\u201d after the 20-year-old visited Leakes' home and allegedly found cockroaches", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fnene-kim-brielle.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
