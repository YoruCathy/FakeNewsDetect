Until Dewayne showed up,\u201d he wrote ominously, the latest in an ongoing feud between him and the former WWE champion.\n\n\u201cI tried to warn you guys,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou thought I was hating...... I was simply fighting to keep the family together.\u201d Doubtless Gibson is feeling more than a little aggrieved that Johnson is getting his own movie before the gang gets back together to film Fast & Furious 9, and this is not the first time he\u2019s called his co-star out on social media for trying to make the franchise all about The Rock. The ninth movie has been delayed a full year to April 10, 2020, while Johnson and Statham\u2019s spinoff, inspired by their delightful chemistry during The Fate of the Furious, is coming July 26, 2019. The spinoff news came only a day after the delay announcement, and Gibson smelled a rat.\n\nIn light of the news, Johnson simply tweeted, \u201cMy goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out. #HobbsShaw2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t address Gibson\u2019s concerns directly, but, listen, the fans can tell.\n\nVin Diesel, the leader of the franchise and the man whom Johnson once referred to as a \u201ccandy ass,\u201d has released a few cryptic social media posts, the first of which, on Friday, featured himself with Gibson and the late Paul Walker, and was simply titled \u201cBrotherhood\u2026\u201d\n\nJohnson is nowhere to be seen in the photo. Yikes.\n\nBut, since he always seems to be the peacemaker in these situations, Diesel posted another Instagram hours later of a screenshot of him and Johnson from Fast 5, the first in the franchise to introduce Johnson\u2019s character Luke Hobbs. The delay of the ninth film is no one\u2019s fault, he wrote, \u201cHowever, like any vehicle that has run around the globe 8 times, the franchise is in need of maintenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have some very exciting news to share soon... stay tuned,\u201d he concluded. \u201cYours truly, Dom #FamilyAlways.\u201d I\u2019m not crying, there\u2019s just some grease in my eye.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58ee513575dd30329d3c49f1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/fast-furious-corona.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f4da740ba2cf01fc200a86/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/fate-of-the-furious%2525202.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58ebf0ee4a7c9f7d59c2cd42/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/vin-diesel-dwayne-johnson-feud.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Stefansky", "Emma Stefansk", "Yohana Dest", "Kenzie Bryan", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/tyrese-gibson-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-fast-and-furious-feud", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls The Rock a \u201cClown\u201d for Breaking Up the Fast & Furious Family", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Emma Stefansky", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.", "id": "59d909548b8c201cbafcea88", "keywords": "movies,tyrese gibson,dwayne the rock johnson,fast and furious,vin diesel,dwayne ` the rock ' johnson", "news_keywords": "movies,tyrese gibson,dwayne the rock johnson,fast and furious,vin diesel,dwayne ` the rock ' johnson", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59d909548b8c201cbafcea88", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls The Rock a \u201cClown\u201d for Breaking Up the Fast & Furious Family", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/tyrese-gibson-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-fast-and-furious-feud"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls The Rock a \u201cClown\u201d for Breaking Up the Fast & Furious Family"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
