The source added that it is not anything new and it is not a new arrest for heroin but it was his original charge of last April.\n\nAccording to the reports, Ryan got arrested at his house on Tuesday when the cops executed a warrant for violating the probation. A spokesperson for Hamilton County Jail told that he was held on a bond of 5,000 dollars and that he was bonded out at about 10:15 pm.\n\nOn the night of Monday, the MTV viewers were shown a preview of the next week\u2019s Teen Mom OG episode, in which Mackenzie was seen to be showing a producer a positive pregnancy test. On Tuesday, the same day as that of the arrest of Ryan, Mackenzie said in a statement that her husband, who also shares a son named Bentley with his ex Maci Bookout, is very excited about her pregnancy. Mackenzie even has got 4-year-old son named Hudson with her ex Zachary Stephens.\n\nRyan and Mackenzie tied the knot secretly in May 2017 before he went to the rehab. Several sources confirmed earlier in the month of June that Ryan had been in the rehab for around two weeks and that he was actually doing well. Ryan Edward\u2019s stay in the rehab occurred shortly after the allegations of substance abuse were made on Teen Mom OG. The couple exchanged vows in a second ceremony in the month of November.", "images": ["https://mixi.mn/pixel.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20%20%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://jbhnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/teen-mom-og-s-ryan-edwards-arrested-for-violating-his-probation-all-the-details-here.jpg", "https://jbhnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/JBHlogoRetina.png"], "top_img": "https://jbhnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/teen-mom-og-s-ryan-edwards-arrested-for-violating-his-probation-all-the-details-here.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Elizabeth", "Please Enter Your Name Here"], "canonical_link": "https://jbhnews.com/teen-moms-ryan-edwards-gets-arrested-hours-wifes-pregnancy-announcement/19358/", "title": "Teen Mom\u2019s Ryan Edwards gets arrested hours after wife\u2019s pregnancy announcement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Hamilton County sheriff\u2019s website confirmed that the American television series Teen Mom\u2019s Ryan Edwards\u00a0got arrested in Tennessee on Tuesday.
