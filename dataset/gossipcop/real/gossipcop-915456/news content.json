While the video is only 15 seconds, it contains quite a bit of excitement.\n\nDean Unglert, who originally appeared on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of The Bachelorette and went on to get involved in a love triangle on Bachelor in Paradise, is shown getting down on one knee in front of Lesley Murphy. There\u2019s also a gorgeous Neil Lane ring shown in the promo! So did he propose?\n\nAnother huge topic of conversation during the finale will be the infamous fantasy suite dates, and if Ashley Iaconetti will go with Kevin Wendt. While the 29-year-old journalist told the world she was a virgin when she joined the franchise during Chris Soules\u2019 season, Kevin didn\u2019t feel pressure or uncomfortable about that at all.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about it twice when she told me. There were so many other things going on with her that I liked that it wasn\u2019t the label of \u2018virginity\u2019 that took away my thought of her. I just was enjoying her company, getting to know her,\u201d Kevin, 33, told Us. \u201cPeople associate [the Fantasy Suite] with sex every time, because you\u2019re finally alone for the first time \u2026 It was just important to be alone and get to know each other better.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor Winter Games finale airs on ABC Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n*With reporting by Emily Marcus.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lesley-murphy-dean-unglert.jpg?crop=176px%2C54px%2C1408px%2C741px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lesley-murphy-dean-unglert.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lesley-murphy-dean-unglert.jpg?crop=176px%2C54px%2C1408px%2C741px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-bachelor-winter-games-finale-promo-does-dean-propose/", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Finale Promo: Does Dean Propose?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "The new promo for the \u2018The Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 includes steamy fantasy suites and a possibly proposal \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Dean Get Down on One Knee on 'The Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Finale", "description": "The new promo for the \u2018The Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 includes steamy fantasy suites and a possibly proposal \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-bachelor-winter-games-finale-promo-does-dean-propose/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-22T13:11:01+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lesley-murphy-dean-unglert.jpg?crop=176px%2C54px%2C1408px%2C741px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lesley-murphy-dean-unglert.jpg?crop=176px%2C54px%2C1408px%2C741px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-21T23:18:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-22T13:11:01+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The new promo for the \u2018The Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 includes steamy fantasy suites and a possibly proposal \u2014 watch", "title": "Watch Dean Get Down on One Knee on 'The Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Finale", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lesley-murphy-dean-unglert.jpg?crop=176px%2C54px%2C1408px%2C741px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519255099.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
