But Raisman, who has been a vocal advocate for the abused athletes, called out the U.S. Olympic Committee and the sport\u2019s leaders for not going far enough.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, the USOC released a statement shamelessly taking credit for a few USAG resignations (note: not fired), as though they\u2019re addressing this problem,\u201d the Needham native said in a statement on Twitter. She went on to call them out for not acknowledging their \u201cown role in this mess\u201d and taking \u201cZERO accountability,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like none of us were ever abused!\u201d\n\nThoughts on USOC\u2019s statement pic.twitter.com/hygTV6nNXd \u2014 Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) January 23, 2018\n\nNassar, a former U.S. national team doctor, has been accused by more than 140 women of sexual abuse. He has already pleaded guilty to several charges of sexual assault and was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison on three counts of child pornography. More than 100 women have provided victim impact statements during his hearing, and Nassar is expected to spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nRaisman read a powerful impact statement during the trial last Friday and pointed out that back in August 2016, the Indy Star revealed that the Olympic Committee declined to investigate allegations of Nassar\u2019s abuse. She said she and several other athletes blame the USOC for being complicit, failing to protect athletes, and remaining unaccountable for the role they played in allowing Nassar\u2019s behavior to continue. In her statement, Raisman called for the board members to clean house and open an independent investigation into why so many adults failed to step in on the athletes\u2019 behalf.\n\nShe closed her response with an all bold question for the USOC: \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take for you to do the right thing?\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/rockport-feat-300x203.jpg", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/aly-raisman-interview-boston-magazine-sm.jpg", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/08/fea_kitchens1-1-300x203.jpg", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/08/fea_kitchens17-1-300x203.jpg", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/in-season-stillmans-1-300x203.jpg", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2006/04/400250.png", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/runguide-300x203.jpg", "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/08/fea_kitchens6-1-300x203.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/aly-raisman-interview-boston-magazine-sm.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["I'M A Scraper"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2018/01/23/raisman-usoc-nassar-hearing/", "title": "Aly Raisman Calls Out U.S. Olympic Committee for \u201cShameless\u201d Statement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Needham native said the organization has not been accountable for its role in allowing Larry Nassar's abuse to continue.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Aly Raisman Calls Out U.S. Olympic Committee for \"Shameless\" Statement", "description": "She's not impressed with their response to the Larry Nassar crisis.", "url": "https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2018/01/23/raisman-usoc-nassar-hearing/", "site_name": "Boston Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/aly-raisman-interview-boston-magazine-sm.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/aly-raisman-interview-boston-magazine-sm.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 650}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bostonmagazine", "tag": "Aly Raisman", "section": "Sports", "published_time": "2018-01-23T17:29:57-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "She's not impressed with their response to the Larry Nassar crisis.", "title": "Aly Raisman Calls Out U.S. Olympic Committee for \"Shameless\" Statement", "site": "@bostonmagazine", "image": "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/10/aly-raisman-interview-boston-magazine-sm.jpg", "creator": "@hayleyglatter"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "google-site-verification": "0XaV9QKUdAM56rDbamBZ6GVmS2NqzAhSO1DgPDye__o", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/cropped-boston-magazine-favicon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516636800.0, "source": "https://www.bostonmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
