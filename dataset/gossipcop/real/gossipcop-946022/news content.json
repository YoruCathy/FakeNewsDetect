Although the singer has not confirmed whether she's singing about herself, many have speculated that the song is about a personal relapse.\n\nIn a new song released Thursday called \u201cSober,\u201d Lovato poignantly sings about reaching a breaking point.\n\n\u201cI got no excuses for all of these goodbyes/ Call me when it\u2019s over \u2018cus I\u2019m dying inside,\u201d Lovato sings. \u201cWake me when the shakes are gone and the cold sweats disappear/ Call me when it\u2019s over and myself has reappeared/ I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know why/ I do it every, every, every time/ It\u2019s only when I\u2019m lonely/ Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don\u2019t wanna fight.\u201d\n\nShe also addresses fans in the song: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the fans I lost/ Who watched me fall again/ I wanna be a role model/ But I\u2019m only human.\u201d\n\nIn the lyrics at the end of the song, Lovato promises to get help and apologizes.\n\nLovato also tweeted out the video this week with the comment: \"My truth...\"\n\nLovato has been an outspoken advocate and ally when it comes to experiences with sobriety and mental health challenges.\n\nBack in September 2017 at the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular, Lovato said that \"every day is a battle.\" To stay on top of it, she said she was going to therapy regularly, keeping up with her medications, going to AA meetings, and staying physically active.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5b2bc8a59ffbab247bcc1ee3/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960656228.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2d29a5ed82452713843645/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/demi-lovato-sober-song.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2d29a5ed82452713843645/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/demi-lovato-sober-song.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Elizabeth", "Devon Elizabet"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/demi-lovato-relapse-new-song-sober", "title": "Demi Lovato Sings About Breaking Sobriety in Her Emotional New Song \u2018Sober\u2019", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Devon Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "In her new song \u201cSober,\u201d Demi Lovato sings about relapsing.
