Kim Kardashian believed Kylie Jenner would be a young mother, and her prediction wasn\u2019t far off. The 37-year-old thought she\u2019d meet Kylie\u2019s first child a couple years from now.\n\nKardashian talked about her prediction as she and mother Kris Jenner reflected on the enduring legacy of Keeping Up With the Kardashians during a Business of Fashion West panel on Monday, June 18, according to E! News. Kris joked about a future season showcasing North West\u2019s wedding, and then the 62-year-old momager revealed she used to envision that for Kylie.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when Kim chimed in: \u201cWe used say, \u2018Season 17, Kylie has a baby.\u2019 And we all looked at each other and [were] like, \u2018Oh s\u2013t! That just happened.'\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, Kardashian\u2019s prediction was two years early: Kylie gave birth to Stormi Webster in February, and the reality show\u2019s 15th season debuts this summer.\n\nHyping the drama to come this season, Kris said fans will witness a \u201cmajor blowout\u201d between the sisters.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about it, I do get really mad,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically just like people being disrespectful. It\u2019s the one thing that really gets me.\u201d\n\nBut arguments aside, Season 15 will also showcase the family\u2019s togetherness. \u201cI think that the way my family and I have always dealt with everything is, we know we have each other,\u201d Kardashian explained. \u201cNothing else really matters. So at the end of the day, this could all go away and we all have each other and we\u2019re confident in that.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-and-kylie.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C1474px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-and-kylie.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C1474px%2C833px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-and-kylie.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C1474px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kim-kardashian-predicted-kylie-jenner-would-be-a-young-mother/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Predicted Kylie Jenner Would Be a Young Mother", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim Kardashian thought Kylie Jenner would become a mother in Season 17 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and she wasn't far off \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Knew Kylie Jenner Would Be a Young Mom", "description": "Kim Kardashian thought Kylie Jenner would become a mother in Season 17 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and she wasn't far off \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kim-kardashian-predicted-kylie-jenner-would-be-a-young-mother/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-and-kylie.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C1474px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-and-kylie.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C1474px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-06-19T21:05:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kim Kardashian thought Kylie Jenner would become a mother in Season 17 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and she wasn't far off \u2014 details", "title": "Kim Kardashian Knew Kylie Jenner Would Be a Young Mom", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-and-kylie.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C1474px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529442359.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
