This site is protected by recaptcha\n\n\"First bday party for @boomerrphelps !!!\" Michael Phelps captioned a photo of the family posing at the birthday festivities. \"What an amazing birthday cake!!!\"\n\nThe man isn't afraid of a well-deployed triple exclamation point. Or sharks, apparently.\n\nAs displayed on the cake, the party theme was \"Boomer's shark attack,\" which seems about right for the child of the most decorated swimmer of all time.\n\nOn Boomer's account, we also got a glamour shot of the inside of the cake, which appears to have almost as many layers as Daddy has gold medals. (The photo came post-shark attack.)\n\nBesides the cake, which featured ocean-like frosting swirls and a rope accent, there were blue decorations and various sea creatures that turned out to wish Boomer a happy birthday.\n\nRELATED: Michael Phelps shared the sweetest pic to celebrate son Boomer's birthday\n\nWay to commit to that theme, Phelps fam.
