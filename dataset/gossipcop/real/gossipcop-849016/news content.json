Six minutes later, Minaj tweeted her offer\n\nNicki Minaj was getting all the credit, with Twitter humming around the world in praise of her decision to spend thousands of dollars of her own money helping out impoverished American college students. But none of that would have happened without the chutzpah of CJ.\n\n\n\nNicki Minaj: US prison system 'is like slavery' Read more\n\nIt was 19 minutes after midnight on Sunday morning when CJ, a 21-year-old student working two jobs to pay her college fees, dropped her tweet. She had just seen a message from Minaj to her international fans \u2013 the rapper said she would pay their airfare from any country should they win a contest to spend time with her at the upcoming Billboard music awards in Las Vegas.\n\nIt was all very well for Minaj to help out fans from around the world with plane tickets, CJ thought, but what about those struggling in the US, who couldn\u2019t even afford to go to school? \u201cWell you wanna pay for my tuition,\u201d she tweeted back at the star.\n\nCJ \ud83e\udd34\ud83c\udffd (@cjbydesign) @NICKIMINAJ Well you wanna pay for my tuition? pic.twitter.com/BhDil75UPj\n\nSix minutes later, Minaj replied. Sure, she said \u2013 as long as your grades are good enough:\n\nNICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) Show me straight A's that I can verify w/ur school and I'll pay it. Who wants to join THAT contest?!?!\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Dead serious. Shld I set it up? https://t.co/czH715u64a\n\nOver the next few hours, a flood of other hard-pressed students joined CJ in putting out distress messages to Minaj. And the star duly replied, offering support to more than 30 of them in the form of tuition or help in paying off college loans.\n\n'She's a wild woman, she's a shaman': Nicki Minaj becomes a feminist art muse Read more\n\nThe beneficiaries included Liyah, who asked for $1,548 to enroll in college for next year plus $250 for books; a fan named Onika who needed $700 to pay off back loans before she could return to school; and Ashley who, like Minaj, comes from Queens, New York. She asked for $500, to pay off her tuition.\n\n\u201cGot u,\u201d Minaj replied.\n\nIn each case the rapper asked her fans to send her proof of their grades \u2013 which had to be straight As \u2013 and of their financial need, by Twitter direct message. Lest anyone thought it might have been a publicity stunt, the website TMZ confirmed with at least one fan that they had already received $500 from the celebrity.\n\nShortly after 1am, Minaj felt she had forked out enough promises of thousands of dollars and decided to call it a night.\n\nNICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) Ok u guys. It's been fun. Let me make those payments tmrw then see if I have any money left\ud83d\ude02. I'll do some more in a month or 2. \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf80\ud83c\udf80\ud83c\udf80\n\nIt was not bad for an hour\u2019s work. Minaj had cost herself $30,000-plus in pledges, but she had gained vastly more than that in global adoration, which made a change from the usual stories about her latest \u201ccatfight\u201d.\n\nAnd CJ? She felt the love too \u2013 and enjoyed some help towards her college fees.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Nicki+Minaj%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CTwitter%2CUS+universities%2CUS+news%2CUS+student+debt", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da4f132f41ed99c39cb6190134f7f25ef575d9b/0_165_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=409502a68fe4e5a2a2ee3cb60aeab12f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da4f132f41ed99c39cb6190134f7f25ef575d9b/0_165_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a36c81e6e5fa75dd8190fbd8bc8de4c8", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_MlX1-VwAI37sH.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da4f132f41ed99c39cb6190134f7f25ef575d9b/0_165_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a36c81e6e5fa75dd8190fbd8bc8de4c8", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/07/nicki-minaj-twitter-college-tuition-student-loans-contest", "title": "Nicki Minaj offers to pay students\u2019 tuition after fan asks for help on Twitter", "meta_data": {"description": "The rapper said she would pay international airfare for contest winners, so a US student asked for help with tuition.
