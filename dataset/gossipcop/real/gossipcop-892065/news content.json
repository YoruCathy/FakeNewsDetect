I really genuinely enjoy it.\"\n\nAnd Prinsloo is on board with a big family, too \u2014 maybe even bigger than he envisions.\n\n\"She wants like 100 babies, but I don't know if I can do that,\" he admitted.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.fit-760w.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201708/tdy_pop_maroon_5_170814.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/parents/adam-levine-reveals-sex-baby-no-2-gives-ellen-degeneres-t118508", "title": "Adam Levine reveals sex of baby No. 2 \u2014 and gives Ellen DeGeneres naming rights", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/parents/adam-levine-reveals-sex-baby-no-2-gives-ellen-degeneres-t118508", "title": "Adam Levine reveals sex of baby No. 2 \u2014 and gives Ellen naming rights", "description": "Adam Levine and wife Behati Prinsloo are expecting another bundle of joy, and now we know even more about the baby on the way.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Adam Levine reveals sex of baby No. 2 \u2014 and gives Ellen naming rights", "description": "Adam Levine and wife Behati Prinsloo are expecting another bundle of joy, and now we know even more about the baby on the way.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Adam Levine and wife Behati Prinsloo are expecting another baby, and now we know even more about the bundle of joy on the way.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1294337/adam-levine-ellen-today-171107-tease_7935effe4901dfd67e9c05676166c0f7.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jdHJMwCb84"], "publish_date": 1510068000.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
