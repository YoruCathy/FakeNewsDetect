But in Chris Hemsworth's case, he's been able to pursue his dreams while being a dad, and it's been made possible, in large part, because of his wife, a new interview reveals. In GQ Australia's November 2017 issue, Chris admits that wife Elsa Pataky, an actress, model and film producer from Spain, has made many sacrifices over the course of their six-year marriage so that he could become a Hollywood star, E! Online reports. The Australian actor, who got his big break in 2011 as the lead in Thor and has starred in several Marvel movies, as well as Snow White and the Huntsman and Ghostbusters, met Elsa back in 2010, and the two quickly wed a year after. They have three kids together\u2014daughter India Rose, 5, and twin sons, Tristan and Sasha, 3\u2014and are currently settled in Byron Bay, Australia, after having lived in Malibu prior. Chris tells GQ Australia, \"In terms of work, she's certainly given up more than I have. She'd like me to step back and be at home with the kids more, and of course, I want that too.\"\n\nHowever, it doesn't look like he'll be helping out more at home anytime soon, adding, \"But I feel like I'm at this crucial point in my career\u2014I've just got to set up for longevity or I'll slip off.\" To make it up to his wife, Chris says he makes date night a priority. \"Once you have children, every instinct and every moment of your time is consumed by that. You've got nothing for each other, so make sure you have date night even if it's once in a blue moon, because most of the time you're just too tired and you'd actually prefer to sleep,\" he explains. And while he does praise her, he says he doesn't do so in a particularly romantic way. \"There's no shortage of how much I tell her I love her. But I guess there's no detail in it, why or how.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035029&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2020/04/lauren_mcdonald.jpg?itok=J2Y_5kwc&fc=50,50", "https://bonniercorp.122.2o7.net/b/ss//1/H.22.1--NS/0", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/og-images/2017/10/elsa_pataky_chris_hemsworth_fb.jpg?itok=QVyqtq7s", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2020/04/instantpot.jpg?itok=LPlvnylp&fc=50,50", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2018/09/happy_couple_0.jpg?itok=dcHd2uAj&fc=50,50", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2020/04/snarkymommy.jpg?itok=XpuNAXlj&fc=50,50", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1482788748627554&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2020/04/twit.jpg?itok=YyyOA3B_&fc=50,50", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-cafODhhaQOlCs.gif", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/logo_1_0_0.png", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/themes/sand/images/print-logo.jpg", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/logo_3.png", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2020/04/momics_high_res.jpg?itok=e1P9H1VS&fc=50,50", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/all/modules/bonnier/bonnier_publications/theme/bonnier-logo-black.png", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/mobile-logo_0_0.png", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2017/01/google_headquarters.jpg?itok=5OKiVK0O&fc=50,50", "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/325_4x3/public/images/2020/04/little-boy-playing-in-the-sand-lead.jpg?itok=URJ2uaAu&fc=50,50"], "top_img": "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/og-images/2017/10/elsa_pataky_chris_hemsworth_fb.jpg?itok=QVyqtq7s", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.workingmother.com/chris-hemsworth-admits-his-wife-sacrificed-lot-for-his-career", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Admits His Wife Sacrificed a Lot for His Career", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/working.mother"}, "description": "In a new interview, the father of three explains how wife Elsa Pataky's sacrifices have influenced his path to stardom.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "fb": {"admins": 1007220039, "pages": "44332379976,9676815399,150089748377976,139518542733731"}, "og": {"site_name": "Working Mother", "url": "https://www.workingmother.com/chris-hemsworth-admits-his-wife-sacrificed-lot-for-his-career", "type": "article", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Admits His Wife Sacrificed a Lot for His Career", "description": "In a new interview, the father of three explains how wife Elsa Pataky's sacrifices have influenced his path to stardom.", "image": "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/styles/opengraph_1_91x1/public/images/og-images/2017/10/elsa_pataky_chris_hemsworth_fb.jpg?itok=QVyqtq7s"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.workingmother.com/chris-hemsworth-admits-his-wife-sacrificed-lot-for-his-career", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Admits His Wife Sacrificed a Lot for His Career", "image": "https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/images/2017/10/chris_hemsworth_elsa_pataky.png", "domain": "https://www.workingmother.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.workingmother.com", "summary": ""}
