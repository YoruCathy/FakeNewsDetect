And after seeing her latest photoshoot for Playboy, we can attest that she also looks better than ever.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous freedom in having lived as long as I have. Like my father used to say, I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin,\u201d she told Playboy. \u201cI feel much sexier now than I ever did when I was younger.\u201d\n\nThat confidence was built up over years as a successful actress, with starring roles in Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, Live and Let Die, and East of Eden. These days, she still acts in movies and television \u2014 like the new sitcom Let\u2019s Get Physical where appropriately, she plays a role as a \u201cgodmother of aerobics\u201d \u2014 but she has also rekindled her passion for the theatre.\n\nSeymour says the best thing about being at this stage in her life is the fact that she doesn\u2019t feel the need to prove herself anymore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to prove anything to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, it\u2019s all about \u2018look at me.\u2019 I\u2019m not trying to get anyone to look at me.\u201d\n\nThat said, the former Bond girl no doubt still draws attention for her incredible physique and good looks. Here\u2019s what she eats and does to keep herself feeling great.\n\nShe mixes it up with pilates and putting.\n\nSeymour heads to the golf course often to improve her game and get some light exercise. When she\u2019s not working on her swing, she\u2019s often in the gym using a Gyrotonic machine as part of her pilates routine. And she\u2019s seriously devoted to her workout \u2014 she\u2019s reportedly been attending Pilates classes for 30 years!\n\nShe works on her core with isometric exercises.\n\nLast workout for 2016 A post shared by Jane Seymour (@janeseymour) on Dec 31, 2016 at 4:27pm PST\n\nIsometric exercise is any move where your muscles are engaged but not contracting, such as plank pose. Seymour says she practices these moves to maintain a flat, toned stomach.\n\n\u201cWith isometrics, you\u2019re isolating and engaging the stomach muscles to strengthen them. It has given me really strong stomach muscles, and I have a longer, leaner look than before,\u201d she said in an interview with Lifetime.\n\nShe takes it easy sometimes.\n\nFeatured image: Getty Images/Gallo images\n\nFrom: Good Housekeeping US\n\nAlso read:\n\nThis is the best manicure colour to make your hands look younger\n\nEight easy hacks that will make you look younger today!\n\nHair-colour shades to make you look younger", "images": ["https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/canned-food-65x65.jpg", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-GH-flavicon-32x32.jpg", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/subscribe-4.png", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GH_footer-logo.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/970082005/?guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/FIPP-logo.png", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/serach.png", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/subscribe.png", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/carb-cycling_fcafotodigital_istock-65x65.jpg", "https://www.womenonwheels.co.za/wp-content/uploads/associated_mag_logo.png", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/gh-header.png", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Diy-body-scrub-and-cosmetics_Anatoliy-Sizov_iStock-65x65.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/defdb3b213f028728cf1e4f8cf6e80de?s=150&d=mm&r=g", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/braids.jpg", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/iablogo.png", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/wp-content/themes/ghk/images/DCCI_Logo_Standard.png", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rachel-Green-friends--65x65.jpg", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/JAN_FEB-Pearl-cover-65x65.jpg", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jane-seymour.jpg", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nails.png", "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/reading-to-child-65x65.jpg"], "top_img": "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-GH-flavicon-32x32.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madge Booth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za/jane-seymour-looks-47-67/", "title": "THIS is why Jane Seymour looks 47 at 67", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "b441f5f0b3f9fa8ac232b7ef3c74f4aa"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "At 67, actress Jane Seymour says she feels better than ever", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "WooFramework 6.0.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://goodhousekeeping.fetcha.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-GH-flavicon-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.za", "summary": ""}
