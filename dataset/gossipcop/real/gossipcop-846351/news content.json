This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\n\u201cAbout three years ago, we decided to add to our family and bought five chickens,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cI raised them inside my house for about six weeks, and then it was time for them to have a coop.\u201d\n\nThey built a miniature version of the family\u2019s own house with a gray color palette throughout. Richie also decided to create sections for the chickens to lay eggs, which didn\u2019t seem to actually work.\n\n\u201cThey actually just lay eggs all over the place, so that was just a romantic idea I had, I guess,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nOne of her favorite parts about the chicken coop is the return on investment. \u201cThey are the easiest animals to take care of, they are so much fun for kids and they just give me beautiful colored eggs every day,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough it can sometimes get a little messy. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really disgusting in there,\u201d she added. \u201cI get really dirty. I have two pairs of coop shoes that I rotate and a pair of jeans I just want to take off right away, and sometimes I just put on overalls.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Why Nicole Richie is glad social media wasn't around when she was a teen\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough to keep her away.
