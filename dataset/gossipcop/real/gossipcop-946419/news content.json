So the underlings pull a Parent Trap (Harper thinks they\u2019re Cyrano-ing; she is incorrect), utilizing their scarily-thorough intel and total control over their bosses\u2019 lives to matchmake their managers. As genre requires, the hijinksers become the hijinksed, the right people find love, the wrong people get caught, and everyone lives to strive another day \u2014 all to a peppy, sunny soundtrack.\n\nThere\u2019s snappy banter, revelations about purpose and meaning and love, and kissing on the jumbrotron\u2026and it\u2019s great. It\u2019s stuffed with delicious, supporting turns from comedy-land favorites: Tituss Burgess from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Pete Davidson of SNL (and BDE) fame, Search Party\u2018s Meredith Hagner. It is a sip of lemonade in this swampiest of summers, a much-needed break from breaking news.\n\nAnd it was directed by Claire Scanlon, a veteran of TV comedy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Black-ish, Fresh off the Boat, The Office, the buzziest episode of the new season of GLOW) making her feature film debut. Which would be an exciting feat no matter what but is an especially impressive one when you learns he shot Set it Up while she was eight months pregnant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScanlon spoke with ThinkProgress about disclosing her pregnancy to the Netflix powers-that-be (easier than you might expect), hiring so many women behind the scenes (also easier than you might expect), and casting people of color as leads, supporting characters, and extras (harder than you\u2019d think).\n\nI read that you gave birth something like a month after you finished shooting.\n\nNot even! Our last day of production was July 1 and I gave birth to Nicholas on July 29.\n\nOkay, so talk me through that timeline. Did you know that filming would coincide with the end of your pregnancy? When plans for this movie got underway, did you even know you\u2019d be pregnant?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was pregnant when we met with Matt Brodie [Netflix\u2019s head of original film] and Netflix. He didn\u2019t know I was pregnant, but I did! My first daughter, I was pregnant with while directing Last Man on Earth. I knew I could direct pregnant. I\u2019m one of those lucky people where I knew it wouldn\u2019t wear me down. Knowing that, I just kind of kept it to myself.\n\nWhen Netflix said they actually wanted to do [Set it Up] and then they meant it, [that was when] we told them I was pregnant.\n\n\u201cWhen we would [say], \u2018this is a diverse casting situation,\u2019 people would still just send us white people. You have to be like, no, it\u2019s not just trying to be politically correct. We mean it.\u201d\n\nWhat did that conversation entail? Were you nervous at all going into it?\n\nI think it was a very perfunctory conversation producers had with him. Like, \u201cOh, by the way, Claire\u2019s pregnant.\u201d Because you have to be insured in general, as an above-the-line person. I had to get a doctor\u2019s visit. Actors have to do it, too. They just let Matt Brodie know I was pregnant, and he didn\u2019t care. And then he came to visit set at one point. I think it was the second of two visits, and I was very pregnant for both. I went from seven-and-a-half to nine months over the course of the shoot. I was showing. And he was like, \u201cOh, she\u2019s REALLY pregnant!\u201d But he\u2019d been watching the dailies and everything was coming in fine. It was not ever an issue.\n\nDirector Claire Scanlon attends the \"Set It Up\" New York Screening at AMC Lincoln Square Theater on June 12, 2018 in New York City.

Because one thing that sticks out to me, just scrolling through that IMDB, is the number of women in high-level positions. It\u2019s not just you at the top, surrounded by a bunch of men.\n\nWe started in April 2017. We were in New York. So we started with, who\u2019s available in the city and who can come?\n\nAnd right off the bat, I talked to the line producer, Carrie Fix. She really loved the script and wanted to do it. She was immediately hired after we had a phone conversation. One of her closest friends was a location manager, and happens to be a woman, Sascha Springer, and so that was easy. We have a great working relationship already.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had a phone interview with Jane Musky, who was the production designer on When Harry Met Sally\u2026 and when you\u2019re doing your first feature romantic comedy, you want to have some good luck \u2014 some When Harry Met Sally\u2026 fairy dust. Anything that touched that movie, I wanted to be near. She was great, and she went above and beyond on her job. She was so experienced and knew New York backward and forward. I could go to her and say, \u201cI\u2019m stressed about this, what do you think?\u201d She was a great confidant and a great mentor.\n\nJuliet [Berman, producer] Katie [Silberman, screenwriter] were obviously involved in the project before I came on. The costume designer, Rebecca Hofherr, was Lucy [Liu]\u2019s costume designer on Elementary. We all have our favorite Lucy outfit in the movie. The clothes are so good. Rebecca [Hofher, costume designer] was great, too.\n\nIt\u2019s funny to hear you describe it this way, because this sounds exactly like the same, \u201cOh, I just hired my friend who I knew would be great\u201d logic that you always hear from straight white dudes when they are explaining why they don\u2019t hire women and people of color. That it\u2019s not malice, racism, sexism, or any intentional exclusion; they\u2019re just working within their existing networks.\n\nIt is! It\u2019s the exact same thing, which is why it\u2019s so great I was in a position to hire people. Because that is how it works!\n\nComing from television, showrunners have the best intentions. But in TV, the writer is king. You\u2019re being vulnerable. Writing is a very scary thing, and when you\u2019re putting your ideas out there, you want your close friends around. I get why people are like, I just want to hire my friends, they\u2019re not going to laugh at me. I work in comedy, and someone making fun of you is a killer of confidence and of comedy. And I totally get that.\n\nBut I also see it breeds \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say \u201cincest,\u201d but it means you\u2019re not breaking out of your group. Which is dumb, because having new, fresh points of view can enhance your show.\n\nWhat are the tropes of the rom-com that you love and wanted to maintain, and what is the stuff that you thought, hmm, that hasn\u2019t aged well, let\u2019s ditch it?\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m probably not the rom-com lover that Katie is. I\u2019m a comedy lover. I have nothing on Mindy Kaling \u2014 although I did cut her pilot [for The Mindy Project], which was an homage to all the great moments in rom-com history. From Mindy, I know what a rom-com lover is, and knowing Mindy, I can\u2019t hold a candle to her. She is the kind of person who sits home and will watch all of them in a go.\n\nI like comedy, so I would say I air on the side of the rom-com that has more com than rom, and I feel like that\u2019s what Set it Up is. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a ton of romance in this movie. Aside from the pizza scene, it\u2019s not super romantic. Which I think, when they come, makes them more delightful, because it\u2019s more earned, and it\u2019s not too melodramatic.\n\n\u201cWe can all relate to making an ass out of ourselves, and to quiet moments of loneliness or sadness.\u201d\n\nI feel like that genre can sometimes be melodramatic, and I find that off-putting. It disengages me as a viewer. Especially if you use music or nostalgia for a certain song in a very heavy-handed way to evoke emotions in the person that\u2019s watching the movie that you haven\u2019t earned on-screen with your actors, that\u2019s another trope I would try to avoid.\n\nThe ones I love are the ones from the \u201930s and \u201940s. The witty dialogue, the pacing, and the women were on par with the men always, if not ahead of them. And not because the men were dumb dads or boyfriends; it\u2019s that the women were that smart. Like His Girl Friday, Bringing Up Baby, even though Katharine Hepburn is ditzy in that movie, she knows what she wants. The Philadelphia Story, It Happened One Night. Those are all such good movies, and they\u2019re clever.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting how some of the movies that are older \u2014 as you say, from the 1930s and the 1940s \u2014 have actually aged better than some of these movies from the 1990s. In My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding, the age of their marriage pact, when they\u2019re like, \u201cIf we haven\u2019t found love by now, we are HOPELESS and are doomed to wed one another,\u201d is thirty!\n\nIt\u2019s so funny because in When Harry Met Sally\u2026, when her ex is getting married and she\u2019s crying up a storm, and she\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019M GONNA BE FORTY!\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWhen?\u201d and she goes, \u201cSomeday!\u201d because she\u2019s 32.\n\nWhat do you think a rom-com needs to keep grounded so people stay with your story, and what can just abide by that rom-com, pie-in-the-sky fantasy logic?\n\nThis isn\u2019t just unique to rom-coms but I think if you have a character that makes you laugh \u2014 if I\u2019m reading a script and the lead character does something ridiculous that I don\u2019t see coming and they make me laugh, and there\u2019s something quirky and charming \u2014 and then on the heels of that, I see their vulnerability. I always use the example of Michael Scott from The Office. He\u2019s ridiculous, I laugh at him, and then I see how his mom screened his phone calls, or how kids in school made fun of him, that was so painfully vulnerable. And after that, I embraced the idea that he was trying to make his coworkers his family.\n\nComedy and then vulnerability: When you get that perfect balance, I\u2019m in for the ride. I\u2019m ready to go on any journey with that character. We can all relate to that. We can all relate to making an ass out of ourselves, and to quiet moments of loneliness or sadness.\n\nOne of the reactions I\u2019ve heard from people who loved this movie was this note of, as diverse as the greater cast is, the leads are still straight white people. I heard a lot of, \u201cI would watch the movie that\u2019s about Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu.\u201d That we still seem to be a ways from having the mainstream rom-com that centers people of color and puts white people in the supporting roles. I\u2019d love to hear more about the casting process from you. Were any decisions influenced by a sense that audiences wouldn\u2019t be open to this movie if those roles were reversed, that the stars needed to be white?\n\nAbsolutely not. And by the way, the script didn\u2019t just go with white people. It wasn\u2019t just Zoey [Deutch] and Glen [Powell]. We had open minds with all the characters. And none of the parts were written for any ethnicity. I pushed very hard for the diversity you see in the film.\n\nTaye Diggs and Lucy Liu in Set It Up. CREDIT: Netflix\n\nI think it\u2019s a very representative cast for New York City. I, too, have watched a lot of rom-coms shot in New York, and I wasn\u2019t able to get through all of them. To your earlier question of, when is it good to be grounded, when is it pie in the sky, some of them I had to turn off because, where is it in New York City that all the people in the background are white? It just didn\u2019t feel real. It didn\u2019t feel grounded.\n\nWe were always open to Harper and Charlie being diverse characters as well, With Meredith Tucker, our casting director, when we would tell people, \u201cthis is a diverse casting situation,\u201d people would still just send us white people. You have to be like, no, it\u2019s not just trying to be politically correct. We mean it.\n\nWow that\u2019s illuminating, to hear that people didn\u2019t take you at your word that you wanted to see non-white actors.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s disappointing. Look, it\u2019s not unique to me. I couldn\u2019t even say the names of those particular people. But we had to say, we really mean it.\n\nI\u2019ve read studies on background actors and the lack of diversity in that area of film \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t get as much attention as above-the-line casting \u2014 and it\u2019s true, it really does pull you out of the movie!\n\nLike, where is that? Where in New York are you? Is it just some exclusive white mens\u2019 club? I guess on Wall Street, it\u2019s possible.\n\nHow do you feel about having your first feature film debut this on Netflix and not in theaters?\n\nI\u2019m 100 percent sure more people saw the movie because of Netflix, because it\u2019s this international audience. We went into Netflix and they could say that in the Philippines and Brazil, audiences are really into romance and will love this movie. So they already knew, let\u2019s go hard in these countries.\n\n\u201cI should be really careful how to say this. Everyone has an interesting story to tell. But it\u2019s been heavily weighted on the white man side, and I\u2019d rather watch \u2018Insecure\u2019 than \u2018Last Man Standing.'\u201d\n\nI think for a first feature, it\u2019s been great [to not] have the pressure of the big box office weekend. It could open and build, versus it all depends on those first two days. That\u2019s insane! There\u2019s so much stuff out there. This was initially at MGM and Emilia Clarke was supposed to play Harper, and due to MGM moving slowly, we lost her to Game of Thrones, and I\u2019m not sad. Because I think Netflix really backs the creative team. They didn\u2019t give us many notes at all. I get to do it and it [if it failed] it would be me, my failure, not everyone else giving me notes. This is my movie. I\u2019m very proud of this movie.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve Googled yourself recently, but almost all these headlines about you basically say: CLAIRE IS SAVING THE ROM-COM. What do you make of those \u2018death of the romantic comedy \u2018 stories. Are people not interested in the genre anymore? Did the genre abandon a still-interested audience?\n\nI think the audience is there and it always has been, Studios topped making the rom-com because it became financially difficult to market, when we had big expensive stars and the stories become more and more formulaic. I think it all comes down tot he writing. Katie wrote a great script. The characters are delightful, goofy, lovable. It\u2019s the story, stupid! You always kind of come back to that.\n\nI think that rom-coms just started getting more and more vapid and formulaic, and relying on those tropes. And then it\u2019s like when you are eating that bag of chips, you\u2019re not really sated, and you feel like crap afterwards. That was the experience with some of those rom-coms, and people stopped watching them. But Netflix is privy to what people are watching, and they\u2019re watching rom-coms in droves, again and again and again. That\u2019s how they knew it was this market. It\u2019s not a mystery. People are always wanting this stuff.\n\nMaybe the studios couldn\u2019t figure out a way to do this and find a space amid comic book movies and theme park movies, and they kind of gave up. but there\u2019s a vacuum. I\u2019m a 46-year-old woman and I\u2019d say that there\u2019s not that many movies that I\u2019d want to see, or if you\u2019re a 46 year-old-man who doesn\u2019t want to see comic book movies. Not to knock on comic books, but they\u2019re the only genres. That and Jurassic Park and Star Wars. And there\u2019s so much more stories to tell!\n\nIt\u2019s slim pickings out there.\n\nI should be really careful how to say this. Everyone has an interesting story to tell. But it\u2019s been heavily weighted on the white man side, and I\u2019d rather watch Insecure than Last Man Standing. You know what I mean? One person has had nothing but a pulpit, and the other person has never had a pulpit. I want to see that story. I don\u2019t want to see another white guy struggling in Brooklyn story. \u201cOh, woe is me, struggling because I was white and born in Brooklyn.\u201d Go away! I want to see Issa Rae.\n\nThe movie I am most excited to see is Crazy Rich Asians. I think that that\u2019s the new normal. And I can promise you that\u2019s the new normal, because Ali Wong and Randall Park are shooting this new [Netflix] movie, Always Be My Maybe.\n\nI always like to talk about the diversity of the cast and the diversity of the background, even. I just think that there\u2019s lots of stories to tell.", "images": ["https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2018/07/setitup.jpg?w=1420&h=946&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2018/07/setitup.jpg?w=1420&h=946&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/set-it-up-director-on-diverse-casting-hiring-women-and-filming-while-very-pregnant-86c60e848f7f/", "title": "How to make the sleeper hit of the summer without even showing your movie in theaters", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 200137333331078, "smart_publish": {"robots": "auto"}}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/set-it-up-director-on-diverse-casting-hiring-women-and-filming-while-very-pregnant-86c60e848f7f/?ia_markup=1"}, "og": {"title": "How to make the sleeper hit of the summer without even showing your movie in theaters", "url": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/set-it-up-director-on-diverse-casting-hiring-women-and-filming-while-very-pregnant-86c60e848f7f/", "type": "article", "description": "Talking to Claire Scanlon about making a Netflix original rom-com while (very) pregnant.", "image": {"identifier": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2018/07/setitup.jpg?w=1420&h=946&crop=1", "url": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2018/07/setitup.jpg?w=1420&h=946&crop=1", "width": 1420, "height": 946}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How to make the sleeper hit of the summer without even showing your movie in theaters", "site": "@thinkprogress", "description": "Talking to Claire Scanlon about making a Netflix original rom-com while (very) pregnant.", "image": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2018/07/setitup.jpg?w=1420&h=946&crop=1", "creator": "@Jessicagolds"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ThinkProgress", "author": "https://facebook.com/goldsteinjessica"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2018/04/cropped-favicon-512.png?w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-eRc9PF3TU?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgqHjFn1gaw?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://thinkprogress.org", "summary": ""}
