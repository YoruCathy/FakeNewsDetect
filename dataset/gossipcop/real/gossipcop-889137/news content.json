I guided the hair into a topknot, continuously combing and spraying the hair as I worked to guarantee a strong, tight base for the style. Once the topknot was in place, I sprayed it with Leonor Greyl Laque Souple for hold and shine, then covered the topknot with a hair net to contain flyaways and make attaching the ponytail easier. After securing it in place and concealing the hair net and base knot with hair, I applied on more Eclat Naturel and brushed the ponytail lightly to ensure the look was stable and had gorgeous shine. The finishing touch was a final spray of Laque Souple around the hairline and edges to keep it looking sleek, shiny, and mod.\u201d\n\nEditor's Pick: Leonor Greyl 'Laque Souple' Light to Medium Hold Hair Spray, $36, nordstrom.com.\n\nSHOP\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-kendall-jenner-1-1532964349.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-chloe-moretz-1533051603.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-zoe-kravitz-1532445994.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Rosenstein", "Beauty Director", "Jenna Rosenstein Is The Beauty Director At Bazaar.Com."], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/g5029/todays-beauty-secret/", "title": "Celebrity Makeup Ideas and Hair How Tos", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Just Wore Makeup From 1985 And We're Here For It", "description": "BAZAAR's beauty expert reveals the tricks and must-have products behind the prettiest hair and makeup looks on the red carpet.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/todays-beauty-secret", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-08-01 04:04:21", "published_time": "2018-07-31 03:47:00", "section": "Beauty", "opinion": "true"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "BAZAAR's Beauty Tips and Tricks - Celebrity Makeup Ideas and Hair How Tos", "description": "BAZAAR's beauty experts reveal the tricks and must-have products behind the prettiest hair and makeup looks.", "keywords": "celebrity makeup, celebrity beauty looks, celebrity red carpet beauty, celebrity hair ideas, celebrity makeup ideas", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "gallery", "sailthru.tags": "Beauty,beauty,beauty news,beauty tips,beauty trends,makeup,beauty,hair", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-31T15:47:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beauty-secret-constance-wu-index-1533751322.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Just Wore Makeup From 1985 And We're Here For It", "sailthru.excerpt": "BAZAAR's beauty expert reveals the tricks and must-have products behind the prettiest hair and makeup looks on the red carpet."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532980020.0, "source": "http://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
