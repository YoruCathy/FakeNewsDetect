The gold-studded, low-back style goes for around $600 (and if you\u2019re currently trying to figure out how to make that work with your next paycheck, you\u2019re not alone).\n\nThe suit is clearly a favorite of Teigen\u2019s, as she was already seen wearing the same one in black last week while vacationing in the Mediterranean. The piece is also available in soft pink and clean white, for those looking to emulate Teigen\u2019s gorgeous wardrobe.\n\nIn addition to lounging on the yacht and touching up her sunscreen with the help of her husband, Teigen also took her share of dips into the ocean, sharing a Boomerang of herself plunging into the water, donning the swimsuit and flippers and clutching her trusty pool noodle, with the caption: \u201cI have to swim with noodles.\u201d\n\nJohn Legend also got in on the Instagram game, melting the hearts of millions when he shared this close-up of a sun-kissed Teigen, writing, \u201cNo filter necessary.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F08%2Fchrissy-teigen-swim-yacht-corsica-CHRISSYSWIM0817.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2019%2F12%2Farequipa-peru-WHERETOGO2020.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F07%2F1-gibbs-farm-WBSAFLODAF0517-150x150.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2063'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F01%2Feagle-beach-aruba-365BEACHESH1217-150x150.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F08%2Fchrissy-teigen-swim-yacht-corsica-CHRISSYSWIM0817.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F08%2Fchrissy-teigen-swim-yacht-corsica-CHRISSYSWIM0817.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bailey Bennett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/chrissy-teigen-bathing-suit-vacation-style", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Loves This Swimsuit So Much She Owns It in Two Colors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Travel and Leisure", "news_keywords": "Travel and Leisure", "description": "You can sport her style, too &mdash; if you&rsquo;re willing to splurge.", "og": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen Loves This Swimsuit So Much She Owns It in Two Colors", "type": "article", "site_name": "Travel + Leisure", "url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/chrissy-teigen-bathing-suit-vacation-style", "description": "If you were looking for one more reason to envy Chrissy Teigen and John Legend&rsquo;s glamorous life, their nine-day yacht vacation in Corsica might just&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F08%2Fchrissy-teigen-swim-yacht-corsica-CHRISSYSWIM0817.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 838}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/chrissy-teigen-bathing-suit-vacation-style", "description": "You can sport her style, too &mdash; if you&rsquo;re willing to splurge.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F08%2Fchrissy-teigen-swim-yacht-corsica-CHRISSYSWIM0817.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/chrissy-teigen-bathing-suit-vacation-style", "title": "Chrissy Teigen loves this swimsuit so much that she owns it in two colors", "description": "You can sport her style, too &mdash; if you&rsquo;re willing to splurge.", "site": "@TravelLeisure", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F08%2Fchrissy-teigen-swim-yacht-corsica-CHRISSYSWIM0817.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1186687021348564, "pages": 25440929072}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.travelandleisure.com", "summary": ""}
