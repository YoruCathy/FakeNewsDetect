The film was largely concerned with grief rather than female friendship or shoes.\n\n\u201cPeople close to Kim believe the script didn\u2019t have a lot to offer Samantha,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThey point to the fact that it calls for Mr Big to die of a heart attack in the shower relatively early on, making the remainder of the movie more about how Carrie recovers from Big\u2019s death than about the relationships between the four women.\u201d\n\nI hope when you read this script you\u2019ll see the beauty, the joy, the heartbreak in it Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nCattrall\u2019s turning down the third film \u2013 and its subsequent stalling \u2013 led to a disagreement on social media between her and Sarah Jessica Parker. Parker recently denied any rift, saying the breakdown of pre-production was simply a business matter.\n\n\u201cWe negotiated in good faith,\u201d she said. \u201cI emailed her, I tried to reach out to her and say, like, \u2018We want you part of this. You\u2019re an integral part, of course you are. I hope when you read this script you\u2019ll see the beauty, the joy, the heartbreak in it.\u2019\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t force her to see it, but we did negotiate through the process and ultimately the studio said, \u2018We can\u2019t meet those asks of hers.\u2019 So then it\u2019s over, but that\u2019s not a character assassination, that\u2019s just the way business works.\u201d\n\nWith Carrie and Samantha\u2019s spat, we finally get to watch the real Sex and the City 3 Read more\n\nChris Noth, who plays Big, told the podcast he hadn\u2019t read the proposed script for a third film and would have been on board, but that he found elements of the previous films distasteful.\n\nSpeaking about a scene at the end of the first film in which his character proposes in the shoe closet he has built for her, while holding a pair of sapphire blue Manolo Blahniks, Noth said: \u201cI really hate corny stuff, and it could be because I\u2019m a little bit of a cynic. Like, the whole thing at the end of the movie in the shoe closet \u2013 hated it.\n\n\u201cI felt she deceived me and then I say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s time I give you a bigger diamond ring.\u2019 Hated it. I just hate the cornball shit and I thought it was just really sentimental and overly romantic without any feet in realism.\u201d\n\nThe first Sex and the City film enjoyed enormous commercial success and relatively friendly reviews. However, a followup three years later, mostly set in Abu Dhabi, had an uneven reception.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b687588762c891db41d845321ba4f58a3ccfb00b/84_283_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f9ecd3b91896496c36d13e80bfd49c7f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Film%2CSex+and+the+City%2CSex+and+the+City+2%2CCulture%2CSarah+Jessica+Parker%2CKim+Cattrall", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b687588762c891db41d845321ba4f58a3ccfb00b/84_283_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bb1dc9d86651162a34edffc20f392be3"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b687588762c891db41d845321ba4f58a3ccfb00b/84_283_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bb1dc9d86651162a34edffc20f392be3", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Shoard"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/20/unmade-sex-city-3-grief-death-mr-big-sarah-jessica-parker-carrie", "title": "Unmade Sex and the City 3 was meditation on grief after death of Mr Big", "meta_data": {"description": "Podcast reveals Carrie\u2019s husband was to have early fatal heart attack, so remainder of proposed movie was mostly about mourning", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Catherine Shoard", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b687588762c891db41d845321ba4f58a3ccfb00b/84_283_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=183188760468eadf775d0e83eeae727f", "keywords": "Film,Sex and the City,Sex and the City 2,Culture,Sarah Jessica Parker,Kim Cattrall", "news_keywords": "Film,Sex and the City,Sex and the City 2,Culture,Sarah Jessica Parker,Kim Cattrall", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/20/unmade-sex-city-3-grief-death-mr-big-sarah-jessica-parker-carrie", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b687588762c891db41d845321ba4f58a3ccfb00b/84_283_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bb1dc9d86651162a34edffc20f392be3", "description": "Podcast reveals Carrie\u2019s husband was to have early fatal heart attack, so remainder of proposed movie was mostly about mourning", "type": "article", "title": "Unmade Sex and the City 3 was meditation on grief after death of Mr Big", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/catherineshoard", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2018-11-20T15:34:11.000Z", "tag": "Film,Sex and the City,Sex and the City 2,Culture,Sarah Jessica Parker,Kim Cattrall", "modified_time": "2018-11-20T15:36:14.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2018/nov/20/unmade-sex-city-3-grief-death-mr-big-sarah-jessica-parker-carrie?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2018/nov/20/unmade-sex-city-3-grief-death-mr-big-sarah-jessica-parker-carrie?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/20/unmade-sex-city-3-grief-death-mr-big-sarah-jessica-parker-carrie", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2018/nov/20/unmade-sex-city-3-grief-death-mr-big-sarah-jessica-parker-carrie?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b687588762c891db41d845321ba4f58a3ccfb00b/84_283_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=6f534bccb068bfc3e98f2ee147daab65", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@catherineshoard", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542643200.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
