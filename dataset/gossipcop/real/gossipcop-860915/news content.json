The media empress threw a \u201cWonder Woman\u201d-themed party on Tuesday, complete with a cake, flip-flops, popcorn buckets and the superhero\u2019s signature headpiece and wrist cuffs.\n\nWinfrey documented the party preparations on her Instagram account with a series of videos. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 day at my house,\u201d she declared in the first, adding, \u201cI\u2019m having a party for 28 10-year-olds.\u201d She proceeded to outfit a \u201cWonder Woman\u201d cake with a topper featuring the superhero herself.\n\nBy the second video, Winfrey had entered full fangirl mode, going so far as to place the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d headpiece on her own head. She\u2019s also wearing the signature wrist cuffs as she raves about themed popcorn buckets and cups. She then displays pairs of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d flip-flops, capping off her video series with a shot of the chef preparing some salad.\n\n\u201cWonder Woman\u201d raked in a whopping $223 million globally when it opened two weeks ago, making it the biggest opening for a film directed by a woman. Starring Gal Gadot, the film has garnered both high-end and mass-market appeal. Luxury brands such as Givenchy and Louis Vuitton along with mass-market retailers like Hot Topic and Kohl\u2019s have all created products inspired by the 75-year-old character.\n\n\u201cWonder Woman is a pioneer in many ways including being a fashion icon,\u201d says Soo Koo, Warner Bros. Consumer Products\u2019 chief creative officer. \u201cThese collections celebrate her as an iconic superhero and empower fans of all kinds to be confident and strong.\u201d\n\nJudging from Winfrey\u2019s Instagram videos, this much is clear: She, too, seems to have fallen prey to the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d mass-market bug.\n\nMore from WWD.com:\n\n\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Makes
