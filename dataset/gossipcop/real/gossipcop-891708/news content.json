Midway through Cudi\u2019s performance, Kanye emerged from backstage to the opening notes of their collaboration \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d from his 2016 album The Life of Pablo.\n\nIn November, Cudi also brought out Kanye during a show in Chicago to perform \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1.\u201d At the time, it was Kanye\u2019s first onstage performance in nearly a year following his hospitalization for stress and exhaustion at the end of 2016.\n\nThe Chicago rapper\u2019s musical output was intermittent during 2017, although there were rumors of him working on new material throughout the year. In May, he was reportedly holed up on a Wyoming mountaintop. Several months later, Kanye and Cudi were spotted together at the Toyko studio of Takashi Murakami, the artist who designed the cover art for Kanye\u2019s 2007 album Graduation, leading to rumors about a surprise collaborative project seemingly titled Everybody Wins to be released on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nUnfortunately for Kanye fans, the album never came to fruition. However, it looks like he will be more involved behind the scenes this year. CyHi The Prynce revealed in November that Kanye would be getting back to his roots by serving as the sole producer of the next album by every artist on G.O.O.D. Music. More recently, Talib Kweli stirred up anticipation for new Black Star material when he shared a photo of Kanye and Yasiin Bey sitting at a table next to Dave Chappelle with the note that \u201c2018 is looking good.\u201d\n\nWatch videos of the performance above and read all the lyrics to Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFather Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\u201d on Genius now.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=201983886890479&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17151659&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-f3CPQ6vHckedE.gif", "https://images.genius.com/b83ea8ea26187537b1dff795f9e77ea7.900x500x1.jpg", "https://loadus.exelator.com/load/?g=4&j=0&p=1183&page-album_ids=&page-albums=&page-artist_ids=%5B68%5D%2C%5B72%5D&page-artists=Kid+Cudi%2CKanye+West&page-type=article&user_signed_in=false"], "top_img": "https://images.genius.com/b83ea8ea26187537b1dff795f9e77ea7.900x500x1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-joins-kid-cudi-for-a-surprise-performance-of-father-stretch-my-hands-pt-1", "title": "Kanye West Joins Kid Cudi For A Surprise Performance Of \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=709482991", "y_key": "f63347d284f184b0", "og": {"site_name": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-joins-kid-cudi-for-a-surprise-performance-of-father-stretch-my-hands-pt-1", "title": "Kanye West Joins Kid Cudi For A Surprise Performance Of \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d", "description": "The duo performed together in Chicago last year.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b83ea8ea26187537b1dff795f9e77ea7.900x500x1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 265539304824, "pages": 308252472676410}, "twitter": {"url": "https://genius.com/a/kanye-west-joins-kid-cudi-for-a-surprise-performance-of-father-stretch-my-hands-pt-1", "title": "Kanye West Joins Kid Cudi For A Surprise Performance Of \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d", "description": "The duo performed together in Chicago last year.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b83ea8ea26187537b1dff795f9e77ea7.900x500x1.jpg", "site": "@Genius", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Genius"}, "id": {"iphone": 709482991}, "url": {"iphone": "genius://articles/4346"}}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://genius.com", "summary": ""}
