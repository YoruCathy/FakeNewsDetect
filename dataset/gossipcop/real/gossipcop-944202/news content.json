They broke up in March after two years together. A source told Us Weekly at the time, \u201cIt had to do with the distance and them barely seeing each other.\u201d However, the couple reconciled their romance about three months later and seemed to be stronger than ever.\n\n\u201cOlivia and Danny are better than they\u2019ve ever been this time around,\u201d a source told Us exclusively earlier this month, adding that the lovebirds might get engaged \u201csooner rather later.\u201d\n\nCulpo previously dated Nick Jonas from August 2013 to June 2015.
