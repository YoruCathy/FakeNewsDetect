Your loyalty softens the blow of some of the painful incidents I have relived while watching these episodes.\n\nFirst, let me say that doing this show has taught me a lot about myself and others. We\u2019re all flawed and beautiful in our own ways; we make mistakes, and we all need to swallow our pride and accept them. We also learn to forgive others for their mistakes, which can be incredibly difficult sometimes. The same goes for forgiving ourselves, which I have learned to do over the last year.\n\nSometimes, you need a chance to explain your hurt and your perspective, and that\u2019s what I want to do right now.\n\nSo a social worker, a nurse and a cheerleader walk into a bar... Ha! Kidding.\n\nOkay, here we go...\n\nGoing into the trip, I was really excited. I thought this was going to be an opportunity for all of us to let our hair down and really connect on a personal level without any facades and just keep it real. I was really hoping that this would be a chance for me to actually be vulnerable, to let those walls down and be the raw LeeAnne that I am with Tiffany. To let them really see the core of me, which they did until things got messy. Speaking of messy...\n\nI think I\u2019d like to address the pee-on-the-bus incident. LOL.\n\nListen, I didn\u2019t want Brandi to pee on the bus. (Big whoop!) But not for the reason you\u2019d think. I mean, I get it. If you gotta go, you gotta go. But seriously, have you ever TRIED to pee on a bus? I mean, have you ever tried to pee in a cup on a moving bus? Yeah. SPLISH-SPLASH, y\u2019all\u2026Splish-Splash! Urine everywhere. To be honest, I didn\u2019t want urine draining down the bus the next time he slammed on the breaks. Now, to be perfectly honest, I have peed in a car, and this is how I know the dangers of the task. IT\u2019S DAMN RISKY BEHAVIOR.\n\nNow, apart from urine, something else a little more serious was spilled on that bus - Marie\u2019s lies. When I found out that Marie had told my \u201clittle secret,\u201d I looked her straight in the eyes and you could see her reaction. She fell back on her usual tactics, which is to LIE. That\u2019s her native language. The bothersome part about her response was the that she looked so unconcerned about about the fact that she had been caught. She didn\u2019t even care. It was like she turned on autopilot and just let her lips move and the lies shot out of her mouth like rapid fire bullets through my heart. She didn\u2019t even try to convince me that she, in her mind, was being truthful. This was the saddest part of all of this mess and it let me know where our friendship REALLY was.\n\nI just want to flush this damn poop story right down the toilet (pun intended). When I was sitting outside with Marie and Tiffany and heard that Brandi and Stephanie Hollman were still talking about it, yes, I was annoyed. I mean, I was two feet away and could hear every word they were saying. It\u2019s was like I was on trial for crapping in a car. What do you want from me? Proof? Would that quench your poop fetish? I crapped in a car. I\u2019m sure most of us at some point in our lives have been victims of what Rich calls the \u201cone cheek sneak\u201d that goes bad. SO WHAT. I\u2019m more focused on the BETRAYAL part. I find it very hard NOT to focus on that part of the issue. I went on this trip because I really wanted to be friends with these people, but the betrayal and constant beating of a dead horse about this story is driving me NUTS and causing me to put my walls back up.\n\nNOW - onto some of the good. A lot of wonderful, positive things happened with Brandi on that Austin trip. When we sat down and talked about PTSD and her brother, I felt like I was able to reach out to her and show her my true nature. My heart goes out to her and her family, and at that table, I wanted her to know that she wasn\u2019t alone and hat her brother wasn\u2019t alone. I\u2019m no soldier but I have the utmost respect for our troops and the freedoms that they provide for us and the crap I\u2019ve lived through is not the same as the things that our soldiers go through but it is all real pain to all of us. I\u2019ve lived through a ton of crap, and if I have lived through all of that and didn't use it to help others, then what have I made of it? No matter who you are and what you\u2019ve been through, pain is pain. These are the moments that I look for to have a chance to reach out to someone hurting. My hurt helps me be in touch with your hurt. She let me do that on the Austin trip. She let me reach out and be there for her. I know Tiffany and I both loved connecting with her about that. I loved getting drunk with her; she really is hilarious, and I was SO happy to be able to cut up with her. I loved that, during this episode, Brandi brings up the betrayal several times, and it\u2019s like SHE SEES that I\u2019m hurt but she just doesn\u2019t want to point it out to the other girls. I think she she tries but she doesn\u2019t want to be really aggressive about it, which I get. That\u2019s not her job; it\u2019s mine.\n\nPreview Has Brandi Finally Had Too Much Jesus Juice?\n\nThe morning after the fight, when Brandi talked me into staying, I was shocked. I was in that bedroom holding back a Niagra Falls of tears, and when she came in and said that I should not leave, I really felt like it was Brandi saying, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a different part of you, and I want to connect more with that part.\u201d I really wanted the opportunity to do that. I felt that if I left, I definitely wouldn\u2019t get that opportunity again. So I thought I\u2019d take a chance against my better instinct and stay to hopefully have an opportunity to resolve it all. I stayed. I owned up to what I did, and I was hoping the trip would end in a positive way.\n\nI was so upset with Marie because THIS wasn\u2019t her first betrayal, and for the last year, I had been denying her betrayals. So I have had to come to terms with the fact that this IS Marie. This is what she is to me: A Liar.\n\nMarie is like a tornado and I\u2019m like a small town of 60 houses, and she has just plowed through, destroying every single one without a care. For me to have to finally face this fact after everything I\u2019ve done for her, the secrets that I have kept for her, the lies, the tracking devices I\u2019ve purchased for her, the meetings I\u2019ve kept quiet, the trips to Mexico where I\u2019ve talked her off the ledge, all of it. I\u2019m flabbergasted. Shocked. And it all came out with 100% hurt and pain, which for me (as you all know by now) comes out in 100% anger.\n\nShow Highlight More of The Epic Confrontation Between LeeAnne and Marie\n\nHere\u2019s the truth about the morning after the fight...\n\nThe next morning when I tried to speak to Marie, I had actually texted her asking her to please come downstairs to talk. She said she would be right down, but she never showed up. SHE SET ME UP 100 %. She wanted everyone in the house to believe she was the victim. I applaud her for her first class acting job and for her strategic, but childish game-playing. I mean, she really thought everything through, move by move. That shit wasn\u2019t checkers, that was chess.\n\nTo her, friendship is just a game and I wasn\u2019t aware that she knew how to play chess or I might have been better prepared. She\u2019s only in it for a prize.\n\nEven though she was the tornado, she somehow made into her being the victim. It\u2019s like she was saying, \u201cWell, you little town of 60 houses, it\u2019s your fault that I had to come sweeping through and destroy everything. Sorry not sorry.\u201d The conversation was going exactly the way she wanted. She wanted them all to take her side, and each and every one of them did. (Apart from Tiffany, of course.)\n\nThen the BETRAYAL CONTINUED. I had to sit there and watch Stephanie call me abusive. For her to say, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this before,\u201d I mean, weren\u2019t you a social worker? Have some compassion. I feel sorry for your clients. And Cary, you\u2019re a nurse. You\u2019re ALSO supposed to have compassion. You\u2019re helping Mark perform some very serious, difficult and delicate procedures on people laying unconscious in front of you in an operating room and all you want to talk about is having sex with your husband.\n\nI want to clarify a few things. When I said I was going to \u201ckill\u201d Marie or \u201cgut\u201d Marie, that means I\u2019m \u201cgutting\u201d her out of my life. It means she has no hope of seeing my face again. It means she is 100% irrelevant to me. She doesn\u2019t matter to me at all. And you know what? She\u2019s earned it.\n\nI sat there and apologized to that entire group for them having to listen to that rant and the reason is simply this: They shouldn\u2019t have had to listen to it. That should have been a private moment between Marie and I. Oh but wait. There\u2019s Cary, constantly trying to show what a horrible, crazy bitch I am. So she thinks it\u2019s more important to SNEAK down stairs and COWER around a corner to try and video tape it. AND ALSO - if you were REALLY that concerned about Marie\u2019s safety, why the hell would you get your CAMERA OUT. Here\u2019s an idea: Why didn\u2019t you call the police if you really thought she was in danger. The fact is, she wasn\u2019t in any kind of danger and Cary knew that. What\u2019s the matter with you? All you\u2019re doing, Cary, is showing your true colors and you\u2019re clashing! You\u2019re clashing so badly that even Mark would probably say that those colors are no good on you and he actually has great \u201cFashion Sense\u201d! Be careful, world. Don\u2019t say words around Cary. She\u2019ll just record it and send it to her friends.\n\nSo here\u2019s another weird thing I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around. Cary tends to say this one liner a lot: \u201cLeeAnne is just jealous of me.\u201d When has that come up? When have I said that or ever led anyone to believe that? This is the perfect sign of a narcissist. Cary, it seems to me that you kind of WANT me to be jealous of you. Is that what this is? Look honey-I\u2019ll take my man, my friends and my life over yours any day. That full head of hair and sexy chiseled body that my man has, yeah. His spirit, his strength and love for me is fulfilling. Our life together is fulfilling. News for you: you\u2019re going to have to find someone else to be jealous of you to validate your life for you. (Good luck?)\n\nThe things that Cary is actually guilty of (that most people in this town know about) and me yelling at Marie (no matter my verbiage) are not even comparable. So the fact that she constantly wants ME to be the mean girl says to me that SHE is the mean girl. The fact that she constantly wants to try to make me look bad tells me that her jealousy issues are deeper than I thought. You know what? Go to yoga. But this time, instead of doing it for your body, do it for your spirit and your mind. Clean that shit out. Hell, I know I\u2019d benefit from a little Yoga quiet time. Do what you CLAIM to do! Become an ACTUAL yogi that believes in peace and agape. #NAMASTE\n\nAll I can tell you is this weekend trip to Austin proves to me that last week, Cary called me her enemy and this week she\u2019s trying to destroy me by videotaping me? Guess what, Cary. I own my sh--. What a shame that you can\u2019t.\n\nShow Highlight Dinner Gets Real Awkward and Brandi Redmond Walks Out\n\nEveryone is giving me crap for being quiet at the dinner. I didn\u2019t speak at that dinner because I knew all those girls wanted was for me to get as angry as I got the night before. But the difference is, I\u2019m not going to get that mad, because I haven\u2019t known these girls 20 years. I haven\u2019t put my life on the line for these girls the way I have for Marie. I\u2019ve done so much for Marie over the years, which is why I got as mad as I did. I don\u2019t care what anyone\u2019s judgment is. I\u2019m not proud of the words I chose or the octave at which I delivered them. I admit that I should have sobered up before ever confronting and upsetting situation like that. I never would have even had the courage to do it without the alcohol.\n\nAs far as Tiffany defending me to Stephanie and Brandi all the time, I gotta tell you there, Steph, your mom and dad have got to be incredibly proud of you saying that Marie \u201ctakes it up the ass.\u201d Wow, girl. You were the sweet one on the show, right? Because you\u2019re being pretty freaking nasty right now. And Brandi, stop picking on Tiffany pleeeaase. THIS is what a real friend does. Remember at the Christmas party the stuff you told us about your \u201cfriendship\u201d? Yeah, I\u2019ve never said that about Tiffany. That\u2019s because we are real friends.\n\nOkay, so tomorrow\u2019s my birthday.\n\nI know you guys are going to give me a sh--load of hate on social media, so I\u2019m not going to look at it tomorrow. If you want to reach out, wait until Wednesday or Thursday, because I\u2019m going to CELEBRATE tomorrow. I\u2019m turning 49, and I\u2019m proud of that. I\u2019ve lived through a lot, and learned a lot through it. I know I\u2019m much older than anyone on this cast. Maybe, just maybe, I have some answers, if they\u2019d just give me a chance. This week, it was betrayal, betrayal, betrayal everywhere.\n\nLet\u2019s just say a social worker and a nurse could really take a lesson or two from a cheerleader about compassion. Thanks Brandi, I appreciate you having my back this week.\n\nPeace out, y\u2019all.", "images":
