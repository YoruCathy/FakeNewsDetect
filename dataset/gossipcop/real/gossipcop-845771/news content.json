The prosecution alleged that he bludgeoned her to death, instead.\n\nWhy it\u2019s worth a watch? Unprecedented access and insight into Peterson and his lawyer\u2019s defence team, but despite the relationship forged between viewer and Peterson, the documentary is careful to show both sides of the court case.\n\nWhere to watch?

All very different strands, but equally engrossing.\n\nWhat it\u2019s worth a listen? Arguably the reason by recent years\u2019 True Crime boom, the team\u2019s attention to detail brings every little detail under review, and it\u2019s serialised (geddit?) format allows the team to tell the story with nuance and clarity.\n\nWhere to listen?

In 2007, Briton Meredith Kercher was found dead in US student Amanda Knox in Italy. Knox was subsequently tried and imprisoned by Italian authorities for four years, but was released in 2011. The court case was highly controversial for its subject matter, police tactics and the media coverage.\n\nWhy it\u2019s worth a watch? We hear the Knox side of the story, for what feels like the first time.

He was, allegedly, hot on the tail of a set of corrupt police officers and preparing to tell his story when he was killed.\n\nWhy it\u2019s worth a listen? In one fell swoop, journalist Peter Jukes and Alistair Morgan, Daniel\u2019s brother, discuss the alleged Met Police cover up, drug trafficking and the newspaper phone hacking scandal. It\u2019s a brutal and staggering listen that makes for a very British injustice.\n\nWhere to listen? Available on all major podcast apps.\n\nEvil Genius\n\nWhat\u2019s the case? In 2003, a \u2018botched\u2019 bank robbery resulted in the death of Brian Wells. His death was a part of a larger plan that was hatched by Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes.
