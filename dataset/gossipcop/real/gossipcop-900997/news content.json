Damon spoke with film critic Peter Travers about several men who are facing sexual assault and harassment allegations, including film executive Harvey Weinstein, US Senator Al Franken, and comedian Louis C.K.\n\nOver the past week, Cambridge-born-and-bred actor Matt Damon has found himself at the center of the #MeToo sexual harassment controversy after giving two interviews on the subject. Here\u2019s a look at what he said, and what the response has been.\n\nIn an interview on \u201cPopcorn with Peter Travers,\u201d Damon said that we are living in a \u201cculture of outrage\u201d and that these recent allegations of sexual misconduct need to be analyzed on a spectrum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,\u201d Damon said. \u201cBoth of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d\n\nDamon said it\u2019s been a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d that women have felt empowered to share their stories and hold men accountable for sexual misconduct. He also said people should try to be optimistic about the state of the movie business and of men overall.\n\n\u201cThis [is] like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers,\u201d Damon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not everybody. It just feels like it.\u201d\n\nDec. 15: The response\n\nDamon\u2019s interview was met with criticism, including from actresses Alyssa Milano and Minnie Driver.\n\nDriver, Damon\u2019s ex-girlfriend and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d co-star, responded to Damon\u2019s comments in a series of tweets on Friday afternoon.\n\nGosh it\u2019s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising) \u2014 Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017\n\nMilano, who worked with Damon in \u201cGlory Daze\u201d in 1995, responded to Damon\u2019s comments in a Twitter thread last Friday night that began, \u201cDear Matt Damon, it\u2019s the micro that makes the macro.\u201d\n\nDear Matt Damon,\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the micro that makes the macro.\n\n\n\n(Thread) \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nWe are in a \u201cculture of outrage\u201d because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nI have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted--even welcomed-- misogyny. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nMilano went on to compare Damon\u2019s spectrum philosophy to the spectrum of cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nSexual harassment, misconduct, assault and violence is a systemic disease. The tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers. #MeToo \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nDec. 17: Minnie Driver continues her criticism\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian published Sunday, Driver expanded on her reaction.\n\n\u201cI felt I desperately needed to say something,\u201d Driver told the publication. \u201cI\u2019ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cA man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t just speak for myself in this article, I speak for too many friends and co-workers as well. - Minnie Driver: men like Matt Damon 'simply cannot understand what abuse is like' https://t.co/Z9M120C6XZ \u2014 Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 17, 2017\n\n\u201cHow about: it\u2019s all f****** wrong and it\u2019s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it\u2019s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cLet women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.\u201d\n\nDec. 18: Damon speaks with Business Insider\n\nDamon continued defending men in the entertainment industry in a Monday interview with Business Insider. He said more attention should be focused on the men who don\u2019t commit acts of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this watershed moment, and it\u2019s great, but I think one thing that\u2019s not being talked about is there are a whole s---load of guys \u2014 the preponderance of men I\u2019ve worked with \u2014 who don\u2019t do this kind of thing and whose lives aren\u2019t going to be affected,\u201d Damon said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDec. 19: The response\n\nDamon was called out on Twitter yet again by various Hollywood figures, including actresses Rose McGowan and Debra Messing.\n\nMatt Damon is dense AF https://t.co/B9OKeh1WpG \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) December 18, 2017\n\nMatt Damon- SERIOUSLY? You are a smart man. A privileged, white man. This is NOT the time to ask for a pat on the back. How about we NOT celebrate men who are simply decent human beings. Stay on track, Matt. It\u2019s not about you. https://t.co/mmdbqAUyP7 \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) December 18, 2017\n\nMatt Damon figuring it out on a \u201ccase by case basis.\u201d pic.twitter.com/SbaBpeAizP \u2014 Ted Leo (@tedleo) December 19, 2017\n\nWhen it comes to Matt Damon, I am constantly hunting for goodwill \u2014 Aparna Nancherla (@aparnapkin) December 19, 2017\n\nSophia Eppolito can be reached at sophia.eppolito@globe.com.
