The image, which was taken in Houston\u2019s Atlanta home in 2006 after an alleged drug binge, features a multitude of drugs and paraphernalia. Pusha told radio host Angie Martinez Thursday that West, who produced the entire album, changed the artwork at the very last minute.\n\n\u201cHe changed my artwork last night at 1 a.m. He wasn\u2019t feeling it,\u201d Pusha told Martinez. \u201cThe [original] artwork \u2014 it was pictures that we all agreed on. He picked the photographer, I took these pictures, I was like, \u2018Yo, these are fresh.\u2019 I picked all of these pictures out, he had a little edit to it, how he wanted the actual grading of the picture to look. Picked the picture, great, we look, boom, boom, boom, it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nPusha said that West paid for the artwork out of his own pocket. \u201cThis is what people need to see to go along with this music,\u201d Pusha quoted West as saying.\n\nThe image has been altered slightly from its original rendition, which appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer: a beer can has been removed, presumably for copyright reasons.\n\nPusha also said that West\u2019s own album, which is due next week, may clarify some of the rapper\u2019s recent controversial comments about Donald Trump and other matters, although he is somewhat vague on how that clarification takes place.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s speaking on a lot on this album,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I feel like he even speaks it clearer and messages it clearer and better through the music. That\u2019s where you can see a bit of like, OK, you\u2019re asking these questions. You\u2019re saying these things to get this type of emotion or just get an answer for something else. I feel like it\u2019s better there.\u201d\n\nVARIETY VIDEO:", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Fkanye-west-paid-85000-to-use-photo-of-whitney-houstons-drug-strewn-bathroom-on-pusha-t-album-cover-1202822653%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202822653&comment_count=13", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/pusha-t-daytona-album-review.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/pusha-t-daytona-album-review.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jem Aswad"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/kanye-west-paid-85000-to-use-photo-of-whitney-houstons-drug-strewn-bathroom-on-pusha-t-album-cover-1202822653/", "title": "Kanye West Paid $85,000 to Use Photo of Whitney Houston\u2019s Drug-Strewn Bathroom on Pusha T Album Cover", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Kanye West paid $85,000 to license a photo of Whitney Houston\u2019s drug-filled bathroom for the cover of Pusha T's new album \u201cDaytona,\u201d which was released today.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202822653, "author": "Jem Aswad", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-05-25T11:12:17"}, "pmc-tag": "Kanye West,Pusha T,Whitney Houston", "title": "Kanye West Paid $85,000 to Use Photo of Whitney Houston\u2019s Drug-Strewn Bathroom on Pusha T Album Cover", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "music", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kanye West Paid $85,000 to Use Photo of Whitney Houston\u2019s Drug-Strewn Bathroom on Pusha T Album Cover", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/kanye-west-paid-85000-to-use-photo-of-whitney-houstons-drug-strewn-bathroom-on-pusha-t-album-cover-1202822653/", "description": "Kanye West paid $85,000 to license a photo of Whitney Houston\u2019s drug-filled bathroom for the cover of Pusha T\u2019s new album \u201cDaytona,\u201d which was released today.
