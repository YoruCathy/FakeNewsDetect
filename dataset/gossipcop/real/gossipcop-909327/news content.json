Holmes played Joey Potter, Dawson Leery's (Van Der Beek) girl next door and high school crush, who chose to be with Dawson's best friend, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), in the 2003 series finale.\n\nIn 2015, Holmes addressed fans' desires for a Dawson's Creek reboot or revival more than a decade years later.\n\n\"I don't want them to grow up,\" the actress told Yahoo! Style at the time, effectively nixing the notion. \"You know, it's kind of like your parents -- they never get out of their 50s, that's where they are.\"\n\nHolmes recalled having fond memories filming the show for six seasons in the seaside town of Wilmington, North Carolina. \"We just did it, we all enjoyed it,\" Holmes said. \"It was of a certain time, it was pre-Internet. There was an innocence there.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKatie Holmes to Star as Embattled FBI Agent in Fox Drama Pilot\n\nJames Van Der Beek Celebrates 'Dawson's Creek' 20th Anniversary With Sweet Throwback Pic\n\nAdam Brody Says He Auditioned for 'Dawson's Creek' Before Landing 'The O.C.'", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/dawsons_creek_katie_holmes_james_van_der_beek_1150695.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=q6koxyNu", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-02/dawsons_creek_katie_holmes_james_van_der_beek_1150695.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=cpiJq9XZ", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/gettyimages-692085362.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=TnqSx9El"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/dawsons_creek_katie_holmes_james_van_der_beek_1150695.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=q6koxyNu", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Philiana Ng"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/katie-holmes-reflects-on-her-magical-dawsons-creek-days-in-nostalgic-throwback-pic-96928", "title": "Katie Holmes Reflects on Her 'Magical' 'Dawson's Creek' Days in Nostalgic Throwback Pic", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Katie Holmes Reflects on Her 'Magical' 'Dawson's Creek' Days in Nostalgic Throwback Pic | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/katie-holmes-reflects-on-her-magical-dawsons-creek-days-in-nostalgic-throwback-pic-96928", "title": "Katie Holmes Reflects on Her 'Magical' 'Dawson's Creek' Days in Nostalgic Throwback Pic", "description": "The 39-year-old actress shared a sweet Instagram photo with co-star James Van Der Beek.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/dawsons_creek_katie_holmes_james_van_der_beek_1150695.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=q6koxyNu", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 39-year-old actress shared a sweet Instagram photo with co-star James Van Der Beek.", "title": "Katie Holmes Reflects on Her 'Magical' 'Dawson's Creek' Days in Nostalgic Throwback Pic", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Philiana Ng\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/katie-holmes-reflects-on-her-magical-dawsons-creek-days-in-nostalgic-throwback-pic-96928", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/dawsons_creek_katie_holmes_james_van_der_beek_1150695.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=q6koxyNu"}, "description": "The 39-year-old actress shared a sweet Instagram photo with co-star James Van Der Beek.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, Katie Holmes, Dawson's Creek", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
