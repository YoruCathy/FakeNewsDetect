In jail, Rebecca attempts to atone for all of her wrongdoings by directing her fellow inmates' theatre class, which they don\u2019t take kindly to, especially once they discover that Rebecca is there voluntarily. Meanwhile, Heather and Hector try to convince Josh that he doesn\u2019t have a disorder and Nathaniel goes on a solo survivalist camping experience, only to be comforted by George. Paula gets Trent to confess, therefore nullifying the state's case against Rebecca. Paula, Valencia, and Heather deliver the news to Rebecca, but she still wants to stay in jail until Heather and Valencia call Rebecca out on her privilege and her idea that her being in jail is helping anybody. Josh begins therapy sessions with Dr. Davit Akopian. Hearing the news that Rebecca has been released from jail, Nathaniel invites her on a trip to Hawaii, but Rebecca declines in favor of helping the other inmates with legal advice. Nathaniel calls Rebecca selfish and Rebecca asks him to leave. A brief flashback shows Paula waking up Trent.

After reading the online comments, Rebecca becomes agoraphobic. Meanwhile, Darryl scours the \"white market\" for breastmilk for his baby daughter, Hebecca. He goes to retrieve it on Halloween while White Josh and Josh babysit. Rebecca misses an appointment with Dr. Akopian, but suspects that a woman who died in her and Heather\u2019s apartment is haunting the place. Rebecca calls on Valencia to help her perform a s\u00e9ance, though Heather and Paula believe that there must be a logical explanation for the noises and electrical problems in the apartment. Nathaniel returns to work, only to be berated by his father for slacking off. The firm\u2019s silent partner Bert, the conspiracy theorist from Rebecca\u2019s support group, decides that he wants to have a more active role in the firm\u2019s operations. Daryl\u2019s trip causes him to miss Hebecca\u2019s first Halloween. While dropping off their daughter Madison, his ex-wife Stacy tells Daryl that\u2019s using formula is perfectly fine and Madison affirms that he is a good father.

Still feeling dissatisfied, Dr. Akopian tells Rebecca that she doesn\u2019t have to be a lawyer if she doesn\u2019t enjoy it. Rebecca runs into Josh in the waiting room, as he now sees the other Dr. Akopian for therapy, and Josh tells Rebecca that he\u2019s started dating again. She helps him pick out dates, but neither are successful. Back at the firm, Rebecca discovers a new pretzel shop in the lobby, run by her former co-worker Jim. He explains that he wasn\u2019t happy practicing law, so he quit, which inspires Rebecca to do the same. Heather and Hector get married at the courthouse so that he can use her health insurance. Despite Heather not wanting a wedding, she arranges the ceremony that Hector wanted with the help of Valencia and Beth. Rebecca finally tells Paula that she won\u2019t be returning to the firm and that she never wanted to be a lawyer.

Paula takes her sons, Tommy and Brendan, to do an escape room exercise and quickly realizes that she knows nothing about their lives. Rebecca and Tucker take a trip into Los Angeles and stumble upon an open audition for a production of Peter Pan. Despite being a talented singer, Tucker bombs the audition.

Nathaniel has Sunil follow Rebecca and gather intel on how to get her back in exchange for letting Sunil serve as the paralegal on a big case. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hernandez researches the case and Nathaniel ultimately assigns it to her. He bribes the director of Peter Pan into giving Tucker a role in exchange for Rebecca's diary. Nathaniel makes an attempt at Rebetzel's to win Rebecca back, which backfires as Rebecca catches on to his scheme and confronts him, telling him that they're completely done. When she later speaks to Tucker, he reveals that the audition was the whole reason he came to see Rebecca, but that he did end up enjoying getting to know her. After he launches into a self-disparaging rant, Rebecca, recognizing how troubled he is, arranges with Tucker's mom for him to begin therapy and pays for him to go to theatre camp the next summer (instead of working at their father's construction site).

Distraught that her son is leaving after finally becoming close to him, Paula schemes to get him to stay by attempting to enlist his old school crush, but her plan backfires. Rebecca confesses to Dr. Akopian that she sees life as a competition and that she feels as though she\u2019s losing. Dr. Akopian affirms that she has fallen behind, but only because of her health struggles. Unsatisfied with Dr. Akopian's assessment, Rebecca tries to convince Heather and Valencia that they\u2019re giving up on their young lifestyles and starts hanging out with Maya and AJ, later inviting them and their friends to Heather and Valencia's going-away party. Darryl and White Josh worry about spending too much time together, as all their friends urge them to get back together. White Josh starts dating a fellow trainer, Vic, which Darryl encourages.

To study for her finals, Paula buys a desk online and accidentally hires Josh to help her retrieve it from San Bernardino. Once there, Paula stalls and Josh helps her overcome her inner fear of success. Heather picks up Nathaniel when his car breaks down outside of the city. They continue on to Santa Monica as Nathaniel clutches a package and makes fun of Heather's car. After her car breaks down due to its age and poor condition, Nathaniel and Heather get into a heated argument, and the package is revealed to contain the ashes of his childhood au pair Heidi, which he was planning to scatter in the ocean. Nathaniel opens up to Heather that the only people he's ever felt truly loved by are Heidi and Rebecca, and he feels as though he's now lost everyone who loved him. Heather tells him that he should show more people this side of him, and Nathaniel confesses that his cruel demeanor is a defense mechanism and expresses a desire to become a nicer person. Since they are unable to make it to the beach, they brush Heidi's ashes in a nearby drain that leads to the ocean. Rebecca apologizes for snapping at Darryl and, later on, they almost kiss. Both brush the moment off as a result of their respective loneliness, but Rebecca also enjoys the realization that she\u2019s capable of being attracted to someone nice. This leads to her decision to get back on the dating scene. Josh tells Paula that she'll be a good lawyer given how much she cares, and Paula hands Josh a pamphlet for apartments in the area so he can move out of Hector's mom's house. Back at Home Base, Nathaniel apologizes to Bert and awkwardly gives him a kiss on the forehead, and Heather announces to Nathaniel that she got a new Civic.

Rebecca opts to stay with Valencia and Beth, but plans to tell Naomi about her recent life struggles and changes after committing to being honest. However, Naomi already knows everything thanks to the media, except that Rebecca quit practicing law. Josh falls behind in his adult responsibilities, but gets inspiration from Darryl to clean up Rebecca's apartment. Rebecca and Naomi plan the award ceremony with their nemeses, the Levines, and Naomi promises that her old friend Elayne Boosler will be there. Boosler later declines the invitation and Rebecca confesses to Naomi that she now runs a pretzel stand, but she is happy doing so. Naomi calls Rebecca a failure and forbids her from admitting this to anyone at the ceremony. Nathaniel, who is attempting to become nice, helps Paula cover Rebecca's prison cases and discovers to his surprise that he finds joy in helping others. Valencia is able to convince Boosler to attend the ceremony and after Naomi goes behind Rebecca's back to get her job at the firm back, Rebecca warns Naomi against overstepping their boundaries again.

Josh, being the Prom King, argues with Hector, the student body president, over who should give the reunion speech, and following Josh's speech Hector reveals that White Josh was actually voted Prom King but turned it down. Deflated, Josh joins George and the school's magic club and realizes what his popularity caused him to miss out on in high school. As Rebecca reconnects with Greg, she texts Paula asking whether she should tell him that she slept with his dad, but Paula is preoccupied studying for her law school finals. For fear that he Marco will tell Greg himself, Rebecca eventually decides to tell Greg, who tells her that they both changed. Valencia tells Heather that she had a crush on another person when she was dating Josh in high school. On graduation day, she wrote a love letter to them but received no reply.

To get her mind off Josh, Greg, and Nathaniel, Rebecca doubles down on spin classes in preparation for a date with Jason, whom she was matched with on Tinder again. Valencia warns Rebecca about wearing cheap polyester leggings to work out, but Rebecca dismisses her concern and ends up getting a yeast infection. Meanwhile, Darryl competes with Bert for the affections of their subordinates.

Nathaniel meets Greg at the gym. They bond by discussing their exes and encourage one another to confront them, not realizing that they are both talking about Rebecca until they run into each other at her house. Rebecca explains to Jason what happened and he is understanding. They meet for their date but are interrupted by Nathaniel, Greg, and a mostly naked Josh.

After listening, Darryl invites Rebecca to babysit Hebecca and she reluctantly agrees. While Rebecca is babysitting, Paula hosts a game night that's in celebration of her graduating law school, but she does not disclose this to anyone except for Scott because she doesn't want praise. At the party, Heather and Beth, Josh and Nathaniel, Valencia and Hector, and Paula and Scott are paired up in teams. Paula and Scott are great at the game but Nathaniel and Josh still have lots of tension between them over Rebecca and their completely different personalities. Meanwhile, at Darryl's Greg comes over to help Rebecca babysit and eventually the pair sleep together on Darryl's floor. Rebecca talks to Greg about taking their relationship slow because of her BPD and he agrees. At Paula's crumbling party, Josh and Nathaniel bond over sports and eventually Paula reveals that she graduated from law school to everyone. After Paula announces her success the party turns around and soon everyone is helping Josh with an underwear shoot.

However, Dr, Akopian is unsure this is wise and reminds Rebecca that she originally said she wanted to take her relationships slowly to look after her mental health, but Rebecca doesn't listen and decides to go with Greg anyway. Meanwhile, Paula is becoming overworked and stressed but shows no signs of slowing down. When Rebecca and Greg arrive at the park things quickly go south as Greg is not enjoying himself and Rebecca takes it personally. She spirals out of control and tries to have sex with both Josh and Nathaniel until she eventually ends up sleeping outside Dr. Shin's practice. Paula is getting much worse and when Mrs. Hernandez suggests she may be going through the menopause, Paula goes to the gynecologist - who after hearing her symptoms reveals that she is having a heart attack.

Meanwhile, at the hospital Paula continues to practice for the bar exam despite still being in recovery and Darryl bonds with a woman named April over bean dip. In the waiting room Josh, Nathaniel, and Greg get exposed to squirrel flu after being coughed on by a young boy and are taken to an isolated ward. Due to a delay, Dr. Roth can't sign Paula out on time to take her bar exam, so Rebecca dresses up as a doctor to get a gurney and sneak Paula out of the hospital. However, due to the fatigue caused by her new medication, she ends up falling asleep on the gurney, and she is subsequently taken to the morgue. After waking up, Rebecca realizes she needs to make a change in her life and that she should try out for a musical she picked up a leaflet for. Elsewhere, tension is building in the ward causing Greg and Josh to start fighting, whilst Nathaniel attempts to mediate. Darryl and April's daughters - Madison and Chloe, respectively - run into each other in the waiting room and it is revealed that they are classmates who have been holding a grudge against one another. After Madison overhears Darryl and April express sadness at not being able to see each other due to their daughter's beef, she conspires with Chloe to enlist Little Cough Boy to cough on them and force them into quarantine together.

Valencia decides to audition with Rebecca to avoid going back to New York with Beth. Josh decides to do theater tech for the revue, although this is mainly due to his wanting to spend more time with Rebecca, and after Nathaniel walks in during the audition to give Rebecca legal paperwork related to their work at the jail, the director insists that Nathaniel join the production. Nathaniel agrees, also due to his desire to spend time with Rebecca. Meanwhile, Greg prepares for the soft reopening of his father's Italian restaurant with help from Heather, and Darryl struggles with accepting that Paula is interviewing at other firms who are offering her more money. After the audition, Rebecca gets a comedic song she'd always loved to her delight, but upon examining the lyrics, she is horrified to discover that the song is deeply misogynistic. She makes a few small revisions to the lyrics, but when she presents them to the director, she is insulted and told to perform the song as originally written. At the show's performance, Rebecca is reluctant to perform the original lyrics as they go against her morals, and she wishes that the audience could hear her lyrics. Nathaniel agrees and decides to walk out on stage and sing Rebecca's rewritten version, but the director demands that the curtain be closed before he is able to finish the song. Nathaniel and Rebecca are promptly fired and \"banished\" from the community theater by the director. Nathaniel admits to Rebecca that he really only joined the show to spend time with her, and they almost kiss - a moment Josh witnesses. At Serrano's, Greg is surprised by the soft opening's high turnout, given that he believed the restaurant failed due to \"West Covina turning its back\". Heather reminds him that the restaurant failed because his father was \"a drunk and a terrible businessman\", and that the only reason Greg hated West Covina before leaving for Atlanta was because he hated himself. Greg decides to stay in West Covina and actually open the restaurant for good. Meanwhile, Darryl realizes from a fairly meaningless song in the community theatre performance that he needs to let Paula go if he truly cares about what's best for her. Paula assures Darryl that she'll always be his friend no matter where she's employed.

With Darryl and AJ's help, she draws columns on a whiteboard at Rebetzel's with positives under each guy, although this doesn't clarify anything for her. Suddenly, she gets a call from Audra Levine's husband that she has abandoned her husband and newborn triplets and is staying in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Heather, Valencia, and Paula are having lunch and are each complaining about their problems - Heather's frustration with Hector's irresponsibility, Valencia's anger at Beth not proposing, and Paula's inability to afford her new optional work uniform. Rebecca barges in and asks them to search for Audra, and they eagerly agree to go to Vegas so they can distract themselves from their own problems in their lives.

While she appears happy in each of them, after the 'dreams' finish she becomes sad. After waking up, she tells Paula about the dream, and enters into one of her musical fantasies. Afterwards, she tells Paula about the musical numbers that take place in her head. Paula suggests she should write down these songs. Afterwards, Rebecca breaks things off with all three of her potential suitors. One year later, Rebecca is at an open mic night with all her friends, most of whom have also found happiness.
