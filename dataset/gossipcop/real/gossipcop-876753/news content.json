It's unclear if the church was damaged in the storm.\n\nIn response, Osteen insisted in a statement Monday evening that he and his church are \"prepared to house people once shelters reach capacity.\"\n\n\"We have never closed our doors. We will continue to be a distribution center for those in need,\" the statement reads.\n\nIt adds, \"Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of this storm in helping our fellow citizens rebuild their lives.\"\n\nLakewood Church sent photos that it says show flooding in and around the building.\n\nPhotos that Lakewood Church says show flooding in and around the church.

The shelter originally said it could take 5,000 people but is currently over capacity, with 6,000.\n\nTens of thousands of area residents are expected to need shelter in the area because of catastrophic flooding, according to officials.\n\nJohn Gray, an associate pastor at the Lakewood Church, defended it on Instagram, insisting that staffers couldn't open the building because flooded highways were blocking access.\n\nOn Twitter earlier on Monday, Osteen urged his followers to donate on his church's website to help with relief efforts.\n\nThe church was previously active in relief efforts, including sheltering displaced victims during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nABC News' Anastasia Williams contributed to this report.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/joel-osteen-gty-mt-170828_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/joel-osteen-gty-mt-170828_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Tara Fowler", "August", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/joel-osteen-faces-criticism-social-media-closing-houston/story?id=49480146", "title": "Joel Osteen faces criticism on social media for closing Houston megachurch's doors amid Harvey", "meta_data": {"description": "Ten of thousands of people are expected to need shelter in the area because of flooding.", "keywords": "joel osteen, hurricane harvey, storm, houston", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
