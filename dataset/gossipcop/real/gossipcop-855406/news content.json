Because today is your graduation day,? told the ?American Ultra? star to all the 140 students present there.\n\nThe actor played President Whitmore in the cult 1996 alien action film and reprised his role in the 2016 sequel.\n\nIn his speech, Pullman said he had been waiting a couple of decades to get the chance to recite his Independence Day line at a graduation ceremony.\n\nThe actor also took photos with students and their families.\n\nReportedly, the reason for which the actor chose to speak at WWC was Pullman?s son Lewis and Jack are alumni of the college.\n\n(This article has not been
