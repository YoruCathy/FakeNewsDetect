While Trump asserted he'd beat Winfrey, in past years he said the former queen of daytime talk would be his ideal running mate, Business Insider reported.\n\nStill, Winfrey's well-received Golden Globes speech, which touched upon the #MeToo movement, the free press, and the importance of combatting injustice, has catapulted her name to the forefront of this early presidential speculation.\n\nAnd her longtime partner Stedman Graham's comments to the The Los Angeles Times also helped fuel widespread interest in her political prospects.\n\nGraham, who runs management and marketing consulting firm S. Graham and Associates, has been with Winfrey for 32 years.\n\nHere's a look inside their relationship:", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5a5658fa25954c610f8b48af?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp",
