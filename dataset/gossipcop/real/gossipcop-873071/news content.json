Aside from illuminating spaces, pendant lights add instant chic to indoor spaces and add to a cohesive look. Modern pendants offer unmatched diversity ranging from understated single pendant versions as well as multi-light pendants.

Pendant lighting is suitable for more than just dining areas. These adaptable fixtures shine in a variety of settings and can serve as the finishing touch to a well-appointed space. The versatility of pendants goes as far as your imagination allows and, aside from casual and formal dining areas, these hanging lights bring sophistication and style to kitchens, long corridors, and home office spaces.\n\nSmall and mini pendant lights look great in indoor spaces like foyers, reading nooks, and bathrooms. Large hanging lamps or multi-light fixtures are best suited to indoor spaces like dining rooms and kitchen pendant lights provide bright task lighting where you need it most. Single pendants also look great when grouped together and suspended at various heights for a bold statement. When hanging a pendant over a table, the ideal drop is between 28 and 32 inches, but you can experiment with different heights to find the look to complete your space.\n\nAnother consideration is what type of lighting you need in your space. If you are hanging your pendant in a dining area, choose a fixture that emits ambient, or soft light. If you intend to use your pendant in an office, then task lighting is a better option. Choosing a compatible bulb for your fixture will help you achieve the desired illumination.\n\nIconic Pendant Light Designs\n\nModern pendant lighting has evolved over the years to become more refined while incorporating remarkable contemporary elements like cracked glass shades, highly-reflective specialty shades, and irregularly shaped shades that support modern d\u00e9cor.

So how do you choose the best pendant for your space? You can start by taking stock of the space where you want to install the pendant. Understanding the tone of the room gives you a great place to make your selection.\n\nWhat's the purpose of my new pendant light? In certain rooms, a light fixture serves a more functional purpose rather than fashionable. For instance, the pendants you choose to hang over your kitchen island will provide functional, task-oriented illumination while the lighting at the front door is meant to captivate guests entering your home.\n\nHow do I choose the right size pendant light? Begin by knowing the square footage of the room you plan to add this type of lighting in. You'll need to consider the ceiling height (including vaulted and sloped ceilings) to help you make the best choice.

While many metallic finishes are popular, your rooms may be better suited by wood accents.\n\nBlack\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\n\nBrass\n\n\n\nBlue\n\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n\nRed\n\n\n\nGreen\n\n\n\nSilver\n\n\n\nGlass\n\n\n\nCopper\n\n\n\nBronze\n\n\n\nChrome\n\n\n\nWood\n\n\n\nBrushed Nickel\n\n\n\nBamboo\n\n\n\nCeramic\n\nHow much light will a pendant provide?
