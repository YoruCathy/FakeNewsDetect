I thought there was no better way to explain to the people who have followed our love lives for over three years than by filming our own episode of The Story of Us,\u201d Iaconetti, 30, tells PEOPLE exclusively.\n\nAdds Haibon, 29: \u201cOur close friends have watched our relationship evolve and understand how we\u2019ve gotten to this point. But people who haven\u2019t been a part of our day-to-day lives ask us \u2018Wait, how did this happen?\u2019 With this show, it gave me an opportunity to elaborate more than just saying \u2018I\u2019m an idiot.'\u201d\n\nLove at First Sight\n\nWhile all Paradise fans know Iaconetti has been enamored with her boyfriend since she first laid eyes on him in 2015, what they might not know is that Haibon also immediately felt a deep connection to her pretty early on.\n\nAdmitting he was a little freaked out when he noticed Iaconetti frequently \u201cstaring\u201d at him during the second season of BiP, Haibon \u2014 who thought she was \u201creally hot\u201d \u2014 only has fond memories of their first one-on-one date in Mexico.\n\n\u201cI remember just being so comfortable with you and how easily we got along \u2026 how the conversation just flowed,\u201d he says on their episode of The Story of Us (produced by Married at First Sight and Seven Year Switch\u2018s Kinetic Content). \u201cIt never felt dull \u2026 or awkward.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti\n\nIt was \u201ctruly love at first sight\u201d for Iaconetti, however, who wasn\u2019t able to fully be herself during the experience. \u201cMy interpretation of our first date is a little different. I was constantly scared of another girl coming in and catching your eye,\u201d explains Iaconetti. \u201cI was overthinking every little thing that came out of my mouth.\u201d\n\nThough Haibon \u201cdumped\u201d Iaconetti on the show, \u201cI never felt like it was over between us after Paradise,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie and say that I was in love with Ashley during BiP. It was a slow build for me.\u201d\n\nFlirty Friendship\n\nAfter their first season of Paradise together, the couple built a strong friendship \u2014 but also became the definition of \u201cit\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nDuring a weekend spent in Virginia with their friends for a charity event Iaconetti was planning, Haibon saw her in a different light. \u201cI was in love,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was such a different experience being with someone in the show and in real life. You were just so down to earth and easy-going, ambitious \u2026 sexy. I wanted you that night.\u201d\n\nAdds Iaconetti: \u201cI knew that he was looking at me!\u201d\n\nThough they frequently hung out several times throughout the fall and were \u201cflirty\u201d with each other, the timing just wasn\u2019t right.\n\nWant to keep upwith the latest from PEOPLE?

But shortly after, Haibon extended an L.A. trip to spend time with Iaconetti, and their relationship took a turn for the worse.\n\nAfter going to dinner and a movie, Haibon spent the night at Iaconetti\u2019s home. \u201cYou, like, kind of fell asleep in my bed. We kind of snuggled, but at this time I had to really force the snuggling,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThis is when I knew something was wrong. And I don\u2019t know what was wrong still.\u201d\n\nLooking back now, Haibon says he just wasn\u2019t ready to be in a fully committed relationship. \u201cOf course there were more-than-friendship feelings for me, but I felt like if there was any doubt in my head, that\u2019s so unfair for me to be halfway in,\u201d he says.\n\nParadise Part 2\n\nWith their mutual friends urging Iaconetti to move on from Haibon, the duo agreed to see other people for their second go on Paradise in 2016.\n\nBut Iaconetti \u201ccame in like a roller coaster,\u201d recalls Haibon. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that. It was really difficult \u2026 I was trying to tell you we weren\u2019t gonna be together because I wanted you to move on [and] be happy.\u201d\n\nThe drama continued after Mexico, and \u201cwe had so many arguments that summer when it was airing,\u201d says Iaconetti. Those many fights helped them build a stronger bond, however, and \u201cthat kicked off a solid year of just friendship.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti\n\nEventually, however, Haibon went into a \u201cdark hole\u201d and became \u201creally withdrawn [and] almost resentful and angry,\u201d says a tearful Iaconetti, who even had a \u201cdaybed\u201d for Haibon when he would visit her in L.A.\n\nExplains Haibon: \u201cI think sometimes you imagine like you\u2019re in this rainy day constantly and you just accept that as life. I\u2019m like going after this other girl and we\u2019re going on dates, and yet it\u2019s so much easier with you. I knew that if you and I were to ever date \u2026 there\u2019s no going back. Even if I had a two percent doubt about our relationship, then I probably shouldn\u2019t do it because I don\u2019t want to risk losing you as a friend.\u201d\n\nJared Professes His Love\n\nHaibon eventually signed up to do Bachelor in Paradise Australia while Iaconetti gave love another shot on Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt.\n\n\u201cI remember I was on a date with a girl in Paradise \u2026 and I was just sitting there and thinking, \u2018God, I wish Ashley were here,'\u201d recalls Haibon. \u201cI just wanna hang out with Ashley.\u201d\n\nWhen he returned from Australia, the duo exchanged a few flirty texts, but then Iaconetti jetted off to Winter Games in late 2017.\n\n\u201cI remember I heard rumors that you might have met somebody, and I was sad,\u201d says Haibon. \u201cSometimes I need a kick in the ass. That was a big kick in the ass.\u201d\n\nOver the holidays, the duo exchanged awkward pleasantries before heading to a formerly planned vacation to St. Lucia with her sister Lauren and Bachelor alums Tanner Tolbert and Jade Roper in January.\n\nRELATED: The Bachelor\u2019s Ashley Iaconetti on Kevin Wendt Split: He \u2018Just Wasn\u2019t My Forever Guy\u2019\n\n\u201cGoing into St. Lucia, I did a lot of self-reflection \u2026 trying to figure out what I want, what I should do, if I should do anything,\u201d he says about weighing whether or not to tell Iaconetti about his feelings for her. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair for me to say anything. Ashley goes on a show, finds another guy and now I\u2019m gonna say something? What kind of assh\u2014 does that?\u201d\n\nAfter opening up to their \u201cfairy godfather\u201d Tolbert, however, Haibon decided to come clean to Iaconetti. \u201cTanner loves the theatrics of everything,\u201d says Haibon. \u201cBut he said something that really resonated with me. Tanner said \u2018It\u2019s more unfair to Ashley if you don\u2019t say anything because you need to give her the opportunity to let her know how you feel and let her make up her own mind.\u2019 I was like \u2018Okay!'\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Courtesy Ashley Iaconetti\n\nThe morning before the group flew back to the States, Haibon finally opened up to Iaconetti about his feelings for her. \u201cI left that conversation with him not just admitting that he was jealous but also he had feelings, and you kind of alluded to wanting to be with me,\u201d says Iaconetti.\n\n\u201cI remember you said \u2018I\u2019m gonna keep dating [Kevin],'\u201d says Haibon. \u201cI knew that in the coming months, I would have to really show Ashley that I was very serious about this.\u201d\n\nHe also took a page right out of a romantic comedy and planted a kiss on Iaconetti just as she was about to board her flight. \u201cI remember thinking \u2018I should really kiss her.\u2019 I was scared to do it. Tanner was like \u2018You should go kiss her,\u2019 and I was like \u2018Yup!'\u201d\n\nBut even after sharing a romantic smooch at the airport, Iaconetti wanted to give her relationship with Wendt a fair shot. \u201cI thought \u2018Okay, well that\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted, but I\u2019m definitely gonna continue dating this other guy,'\u201d she says. \u201cI do like him. He\u2019s pursued me \u2026 he\u2019s been all in the entire time and I deserve to pursue somebody else and for somebody else to pursue me after all this time.\u201d\n\nAs Winter Games was airing, however, Iaconetti knew her relationship with Wendt was over. \u201cI just knew in my heart at that point that it wasn\u2019t right with Kevin. I ended the relationship because it had run its course, and then Jared was still there,\u201d she says, adding that she didn\u2019t cheat on her ex.\n\nTheir Fairy-Tale Ending\n\nAfter Iaconetti and Wendt split in March, Haibon went all out to win over Iaconetti and poured his heart into an emotional love letter that took three days to write. \u201cI was scream-crying basically alone in my apartment reading that just sobbing and sobbing,\u201d says Iaconetti.\n\nSince then, the couple have been going strong \u2014 and Haibon continues to woo his girlfriend.\n\nImage zoom Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti Kinetic Content\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s written me other letters and filled my apartment with flowers. He tells me every day that he\u2019s the luckiest man alive,\u201d she says.\n\nAdds Haibon: \u201cI\u2019m living proof that you should listen to your gut, and that it\u2019s not too late. The person I wanted to be with most was right in front of my eyes.\u201d\n\nThe Story of Us: Ashley I & Jared was executive produced by Chris Coelen, Paria Sadighi, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-4-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-3-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-dating/", "title": "Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Dating 3 Years After Paradise", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Ashley Iaconetti,Bachelor in Paradise,Celeb Relationships,Couples,News,reality star,The Bachelor,The Bachelor Winter Games,The Bachelorette", "news_keywords": "Ashley Iaconetti,Bachelor in Paradise,Celeb Relationships,Couples,News,reality star,The Bachelor,The Bachelor Winter Games,The Bachelorette", "description": "The couple open up in an emotional interview about finally finding their happily ever after", "og": {"title": "Bachelor Alums Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Are Dating \u2014 Find Out All the Details", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-dating/", "description": "After three years of ups and downs, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon are finally officially together \u2014 and sharing all the details of their emotional&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-2.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 785}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-dating/", "description": "The couple open up in an emotional interview about finally finding their happily ever after", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-dating/", "title": "Bachelor Alums Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Are Dating \u2014 Find Out All the Details", "description": "The couple open up in an emotional interview about finally finding their happily ever after", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fashley-iaconetti-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/87t2QmKwmqI"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
