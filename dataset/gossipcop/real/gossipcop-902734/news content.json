Dr. Phil earned $79 million last year, making him the highest-paid TV host in the world. His sky-high earnings are mainly thanks to his eponymous daytime talk show: In addition to money from product placements, he splits the advertising profits from the show. The result adds up to over 90% of his total paycheck. The rest comes from producing credits on CBS\u2019 The Doctors and The Bull, as well as speaking gigs and an endorsement deal with AstraZenica.\n\n\"If you are going to deliver a particular audience like Dr. Phil does, you are pure gold to your advertisers,\" says Les Rose, professor of practice for broadcast and digital journalism at Syracuse University's Newhouse School. \"If Dr. Phil didn't appeal to moms at home, than he'd be out of business.\"\n\nCombined, the world\u2019s 10 highest-paid TV show hosts earned $462.5 million between June 1, 2016 and June 1, 2017, before management fees and taxes. Figures are based on data from NPD Bookscan and IMDB, as well as interviews with agents, managers, publicists, producers and lawyers.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/168674866/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/168674866/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F168674866%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/02/maddieberg_avatar_1425069302-136x136.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F168674866%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeline Berg"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/11/07/the-worlds-highest-paid-tv-hosts-dr-phil-ellen-degeneres-and-ryan-seacrest-lead/", "title": "The World's Highest-Paid TV Hosts: Dr. Phil, Ellen DeGeneres And Ryan Seacrest Lead", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "The World's Highest-Paid TV Hosts: Dr. Phil, Ellen DeGeneres And Ryan Seacrest Lead", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F168674866%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2017-11-07T16:07:02-05:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/11/07/the-worlds-highest-paid-tv-hosts-dr-phil-ellen-degeneres-and-ryan-seacrest-lead/", "description": "For the second year in a row, Dr. Phil beats out his fellow TV hosts, thanks to earnings of $79 million.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The World's Highest-Paid TV Hosts: Dr. Phil, Ellen DeGeneres And Ryan Seacrest Lead", "description": "For the second year in a row, Dr. Phil beats out his fellow TV hosts, thanks to earnings of $79 million.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225743im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F168674866%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "creator": "@maddieberg"}, "description": "For the second year in a row, Dr. Phil beats out his fellow TV hosts, thanks to earnings of $79 million.", "author": "Madeline Berg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Madeline Berg", "section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/business/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/3609-4939", "published": "2017-11-07", "modified": "2017-11-07"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509984000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
