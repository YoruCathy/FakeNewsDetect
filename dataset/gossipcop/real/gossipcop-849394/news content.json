Online, comes after a tough four-part reunion, in which she admitted to spreading inflammatory accusations to Porsha Williams that said Kandi Burruss and her husband Todd Tucker had planned on drugging Williams and their mutual friend Shamea Morton in order to take advantage of them sexually.\n\nWilliams had come under fire for repeating the accusations throughout the season because she believed the claims had come directly from Burruss. Problem was, Parks had only heard the information from a still-unnamed source.\n\n\u201cI repeated it because I heard it,\u201d Parks said in the final episode of the reunion. \u201cSomething was brought to me. I repeated what someone told me \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have repeated it \u2026 I screwed up \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Phaedra Parks, Porsha Williams, Shere\u00e9 Whitfield and Shamea Morton Annette Brown/Bravo/NBC\n\nMany had wondered how Parks might be able to return to the show next season, with most of the cast accusing her of being a liar.\n\nParks previously told PEOPLE that if offered, she\u2019d still want to come back to the show.\n\n\u201cI would love to continue,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously the show documents your journey, and every journey has its ups and downs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always accurate, of course,\u201d she added. \u201cBut for the moments that they capture something that\u2019s real \u2014 like being a mom, helping someone out, having a very sensitive moment on television that turns into something beautiful \u2014 that\u2019s the legacy that counts when it comes to reality TV.
