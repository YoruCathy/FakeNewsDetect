Jamie Dornan joined The Late Late Show (Monday through Friday at 12:37 am ET, on CTV) host James Corden for a scene straight out of Fifty Shades of Grey \u2014 and if you thought Dakota Johnson\u2018s Anastasia Steele seeing Christian Grey\u2019s Red Room of Pain was both titillating and awkward, just wait until you see Jamie when he walks into James\u2019 playroom.\n\nIn a role reversal, Corden takes on the dominant\u2019s role, telling Dornan that he can \u201cleave at any time.\u201d Like Anastasia, Jamie is apprehensive, yet intrigued, and follows James into the room. And it\u2019s like nothing he ever imagined.\n\nRather than whips and riding crops and floggers and cuffs, Dornan \u2014 and the rest of us \u2014 is treated to model train sets. That\u2019s right, lots and lots of trains. Hilarious, but then things take a weird turn. (You know, because things weren\u2019t weird already.)\n\nSet to The Dream\u2018s \u201cCode Blue,\u201d straight out of the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack, Corden tells Dornan to turn around before the two engage in all kinds of \u201cforeplay.\u201d The pair dress up as train conductors (overalls and caps, of course), then James demands that Jamie call him \u201csignal master.\u201d It\u2019s weirdly, and we mean weirdly, kind of a little bit sexy. But if you\u2019re not all hot and bothered by the climax, we get it. Because the ending is anything but happy.\n\nThis version may be G-rated compared to the S&M-filled movies but that doesn\u2019t make it any less uncomfortable. And with Dornan telling ITV\u2019s Lorraine that he is \u201cdone\u201d with Fifty Shades, he may have used age as an excuse, but we think we know the real reason why. Blame Corden!\n\nThe Late Late Show With James Corden airs Monday through Friday at 12:37 am ET, on CTV.", "images": ["https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/bell_logo.gif", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Facebook_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/icon_close_share.png", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_facebook_aqua.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_navigation.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Pinterest_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/CTVLife.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_navigation_on.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_twitter_aqua.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/james-jamie-fifty-shades-parody.jpg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Email_icon.svg", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=00fd23e76b23ff54d34a7b3fd2fd570a3c", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_pinterest_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/ym.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Twitter_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_pinterest_aqua.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/marilyn.svg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6485645&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/sponsors/bell-aliant-logo.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=417766778714379&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_pinterest_Dgrey.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_search_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_twitter_Dgrey.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/WhatsApp_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_facebook_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_twitter_white.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/logo_desktop.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/thesocial.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/social/Linkedin_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/FR_icon.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_facebook_Dgrey.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/icon_mail.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/show_logos_2019/etalk.svg", "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/themes/loop.2.11.19/img/icons/logo_horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/james-jamie-fifty-shades-parody.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denette Wilford"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theloop.ca/james-corden-seducing-jamie-dornan-fifty-shades-style-cringeworthy-sounds", "title": "James Corden seducing Jamie Dornan \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019-style is as cringeworthy as it sounds", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mr. Corden will see him now.", "google-site-verification": "SVTb1Z_Uvzk18cAGAhUb6C2qPS-UZH6Zuiei5ZXMr38", "datePublished": "2018-02-07T12:12:00+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 118691728090, "app_id": 384569415349244}, "twitter": {"site": "@theloopca", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Corden seducing Jamie Dornan \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019-style is as cringeworthy as it sounds", "description": "Mr. Corden will see him now."}, "og": {"title": "James Corden seducing Jamie Dornan \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019-style is as cringeworthy as it sounds", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theloop.ca/james-corden-seducing-jamie-dornan-fifty-shades-style-cringeworthy-sounds/", "description": "Mr. Corden will see him now.", "site_name": "The Loop", "image": "https://www.theloop.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/james-jamie-fifty-shades-parody.jpg"}, "author": "Denette Wilford"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilTHiqAmuX8"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.theloop.ca", "summary": ""}
