An avalanche of sexual misconduct complaints followed against a number of men across a variety of industries.\n\nWeinstein, 66, is facing criminal sexual assault charges in New York and has been named in several other sexual harassment lawsuits.\n\nAssociated Press Writer Ariel Tu contributed to this story.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/61778a0f5ef64ea6ec17d2c5967ae6d130e2ca0e/c=0-0-1898-1072/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667238491769134-weinstrin.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667238491769134-weinstrin.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f64c65baf4f917d90643ae68b2135cca99d6cdcd/c=0-11-1898-1083/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667428158344498-DAY001.JPG?width=1898&height=1072&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f64c65baf4f917d90643ae68b2135cca99d6cdcd/c=0-11-1898-1083/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667428158344498-DAY001.JPG?width=1898&height=1072&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/07/18/harvey-weinsteins-lawyers-asks-judge-dismiss-ashley-judds-lawsuit/798810002/", "title": "Harvey Weinstein's lawyers call Ashley Judd's lawsuit baseless and late, seek dismissal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Harvey Weinstein's lawyers call Ashley Judd's lawsuit baseless and late, seek dismissal", "description": "Harvey Weinstein's lawyers have asked a judge to dismiss Ashley Judd's lawsuit.
