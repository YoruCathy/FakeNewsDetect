Amanda Stanton revealed the totally relatable way she met her boyfriend, Bobby Jacobs.\n\n\u201cWe met on Instagram,\u201d The Bachelor alum, 28, exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month, noting that Jacobs slid into her DMs. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a great story. I wish we had a more exciting story. We were saying that we should just say we met at the dog park or something.\u201d\n\nHowever, the season 3 and season 4 Bachelor in Paradise star is proud of the way she first came across her beau. \u201cI guess it\u2019s pretty normal these days,\u201d she teased. \u201cIt just is funny to say.\u201d\n\nStanton\u2019s daughters, Kinsley and Charlie, also approve of the relationship. \u201cThey love him. It\u2019s really sweet,\u201d the lifestyle blogger gushed. \u201cI waited a while this time to introduce them, but they love him and he\u2019s so good with them. They have a lot of fun. He\u2019s like a big kid so they have a lot of fun with him.\u201d\n\nThe reality star previously dated Robby Hayes during Bachelor in Paradise season 4 in the summer of 2017 and broke up in September. Before that, Stanton was engaged to Josh Murray after season 3, although the duo called it off in December 2016. Both men met and interacted with her daughters.\n\nStanton also spoke candidly about the perks of dating outside of Bachelor Nation. \u201cI obviously love dating somebody that has never been on the show,\u201d she told Us. \u201cAfter everything, you know, the relationships that I had on the show, it wasn\u2019t something where I was like, \u2018Oh, I really want to meet my boyfriend on a TV show.\u2019 Those opportunities had just come up and I took those opportunities and it didn\u2019t work out. But I always kind of knew, like, I wanted to date someone who is just normal and has a normal life. It\u2019s been really good. It\u2019s been really nice. He doesn\u2019t care about any of that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe ABC personality, who \u201chopes\u201d to get married again someday, is hot off the heels of a romantic rendezvous in Hawaii with Jacobs and they have more trips in the works too.\n\nStanton is also spending her summer giving back. Earlier this month, she volunteered with Rising Above Disabilities, the largest residential camp for adults and children with developmental disabilities in Southern California at their reality TV-themed summer camp.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/stanton-bobby-james.jpg?crop=0px%2C371px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Amanda-Stanton1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/stanton-bobby-james.jpg?crop=0px%2C335px%2C900px%2C508px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/stanton-bobby-james.jpg?crop=0px%2C371px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/how-amanda-stanton-met-boyfriend-bobby-jacobs/", "title": "How Amanda Stanton Met Boyfriend Bobby Jacobs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Amanda Stanton opened up about her relationship with Bobby Jacobs and revealed the totally 2018 way that they met \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amanda Stanton Met Her BF Bobby Jacobs in a Very 2018 Way", "description": "Amanda Stanton opened up about her relationship with Bobby Jacobs and revealed the totally 2018 way that they met \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/how-amanda-stanton-met-boyfriend-bobby-jacobs/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-12-13T17:16:44+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/stanton-bobby-james.jpg?crop=0px%2C371px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/stanton-bobby-james.jpg?crop=0px%2C371px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-10T22:18:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-13T17:16:44+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amanda Stanton opened up about her relationship with Bobby Jacobs and revealed the totally 2018 way that they met \u2014 get the details", "title": "Amanda Stanton Met Her BF Bobby Jacobs in a Very 2018 Way", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/stanton-bobby-james.jpg?crop=0px%2C371px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531261087.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
