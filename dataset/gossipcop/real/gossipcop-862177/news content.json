{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-salary", "text": "It was a jaw-dropping stat that swiftly went viral Tuesday morning: Gal Gadot, the magnetic star of the summer hit Wonder Woman, was paid just $300,000 for a movie that had already made $573 million worldwide. Meanwhile, Henry\u2019s Cavill had been paid $14 million\u201446 times as much!\u2014for his own first outing as Superman in Man of Steel.\n\nIt would be perfectly indicative of the gender pay gap that lingers in Hollywood . . . if it were at all true. As the Elle article that sent the stat viral said itself, Cavill\u2019s $14 million earnings include bonuses for box-office performance, while Gadot\u2019s $300,000, per a 2014 Variety report, is just the base salary for each movie she\u2019s made thus far in the DC Universe. Though the details of Cavill\u2019s reported $14 million could not be verified, a source with knowledge of studio negotiations on franchise films told Vanity Fair, \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t for one picture. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nThe same source said of Gadot\u2019s salary, \u201cEntry-level actors in franchise films are paid an initial rate. As a franchise takes off, they stand to make more money.\u201d So if she signed a deal similar to Cavill\u2019s, the Wonder Woman bonus checks will soon be rolling in\u2014and the sequels could be even more lucrative. Says a source familiar with both Cavill and Gadot\u2019s contract negotiations, \u201cIf you do an apples to apples comparison, she was paid at least as much as he was.\u201d\n\nWATCH: A Brief History of Wonder Woman\n\nHollywood contracts are notoriously complicated things\u2014salaries are often sweetened by box-office bonuses, bumps in pay for sequels, or even \u201cpoints\u201d on the total gross for megastars. For superhero franchises just getting started, though, the process is usually simple: find a star on the rise, pay him or her relatively little, and then offer more if the franchise takes off. Marvel pioneered the effort with Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth, all of whom were reportedly paid less than $500,000 for their first solo superhero outings but eventually landed much bigger paydays for subsequent entries. (Downey Jr. famously made $50 million for The Avengers, and helped his co-stars negotiate higher salaries themselves.) Cavill, like Hemsworth and Evans and Gadot when their franchises started, was more of an unknown and likely to have signed the same lowball salary contract with a promise of future returns.\n\nSo while Gadot\u2019s $300,000 is pretty small compared with the millions her movie has made, she hasn\u2019t sold herself short; the actress hasn\u2019t yet signed a deal for the now-inevitable Wonder Woman 2, and her agents are surely already working to net their 10 percent of her much-larger payday. (Director Patty Jenkins is also expected to negotiate for a higher payday, even though her contract doesn\u2019t include an option for a sequel, which Gadot\u2019s does.) Given Wonder Woman's popularity compared with the tepid returns for Batman's and Superman\u2019s latest outings, it\u2019s not hard to imagine Gadot following in Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s footsteps as the de facto leader of the franchise. First woman to be paid $50 million for a superhero movie? We wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Keegan.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d532b096099dfe56f7bd2b/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/katey-rich-4.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592dd30642539b38d20a65cf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/8-Stars-Summer-Movies-ss-03.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592dd30542539b38d20a65ce/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/8-Stars-Summer-Movies-ss-02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592dd30628045955e24c64c8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/8-Stars-Summer-Movies-ss-04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katey Rich", "Katey Ric"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-salary", "title": "No, Gal Gadot Isn\u2019t Making 46 Times Less Than Henry Cavill", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Katey Rich", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "A viral, misleading stat about Henry Cavill\u2019s Man of Steel salary doesn\u2019t say as much about the Hollywood gender wage gap as it seems.", "id": "59493a9565b7164374c5bfef", "keywords": "movies,gal gadot,wonder woman,henry cavill", "news_keywords": "movies,gal gadot,wonder woman,henry cavill", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59493a9565b7164374c5bfef", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"A viral, misleading stat about Henry Cavill\u2019s Man of Steel salary doesn\u2019t say as much about the Hollywood gender wage gap as it seems.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "A viral, misleading stat about Henry Cavill\u2019s Man of Steel salary doesn\u2019t say as much about the Hollywood gender wage gap as it seems.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "No, Gal Gadot Isn\u2019t Making 46 Times Less Than Henry Cavill", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-salary"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "A viral, misleading stat about Henry Cavill\u2019s Man of Steel salary doesn\u2019t say as much about the Hollywood gender wage gap as it seems.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594946c565b7164374c5bff1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/wonder-woman-superman.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "No, Gal Gadot Isn\u2019t Making 46 Times Less Than Henry Cavill"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
