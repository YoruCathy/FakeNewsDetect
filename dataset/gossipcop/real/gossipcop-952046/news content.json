The new images, taken by British photographer Matt Holyoak, show the two-month-old son of Prince William and Kate Middleton with his parents and other members of the royal family.\n\nThe photos were taken at a small reception following Louis' christening. They show the Windsors posing with the little prince in a series of adorable portraits.\n\nIn one of the most stunning shots, the Cambridges pose with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for the photos, along with William and Harry's dad, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nMatt Holyoak/Camera Press/Redux\n\nThe Cambridges were also captured in a perfect family shot, which shows just how grown up Princess Charlotte and Prince George are now.\n\nMatt Holyoak/Camera Press/Redux\n\nOne of the photos focuses on the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Louis. Kate gazes adoringly at her new baby son, and both mother and child are beaming:\n\nMatt Holyoak/Camera Press/Redux\n\nAdorably, the Middletons and the Windsors are captured together in one photo, too:\n\nMatt Holyoak/Camera Press/Redux\n\nLouis' godparents are: Nicholas van Cutsem, Lucy Middleton, Guy Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, and Hannah Carter. They did not appear in the official portraits.\n\nLouis' famous great-grandparents, the Queen and Prince Philip, were missing in action from the ceremony. The decision was not made on health grounds. The Duke of Edinburgh stayed behind in Norfolk while Her Majesty traveled to London yesterday.\n\nPrince Louis, who was born on April 23, was christened at the Chapel Royal in St. James' Palace in London. The ceremony was private, but some familiar faces were seen arriving for the occasion, including Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Duchess Camilla, Pippa Middleton, and her husband James Matthews.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the guests gathered at Clarence House (Charles and Camilla's residence) for afternoon tea hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple served slices from a tier of their wedding cake (yes, from 2011) at the celebration.\n\nThe christening marked the first time all five Cambridges were photographed together, and now, they have official portraits to commemorate the occasion.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-princess-diana-1531678757.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-wimbledon-compared-1531674192.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22094923/prince-louis-christening-royal-family-portraits/", "title": "Prince Louis' Official Christening Portraits Are Here, and They're Gorgeous", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Prince Louis' Official Christening Portraits Are Here, and They're Gorgeous", "description": "Prince George and Princess Charlotte look so adorable!", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22094923/prince-louis-christening-royal-family-portraits/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-07-16 12:30:49", "published_time": "2018-07-15 09:41:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Prince Louis Christening Official Royal Family Portraits Released - Prince Louis Christened", "description": "Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte appear in the official portraits for Prince Louis' christening, which took place on Monday July 9.
