The key is these sketches take place in his car.\n\nOn Sunday's (January 28), Corden decided to surprise commuters on their way to work in New York for the first-ever Subway Karaoke in celebration of the Grammy Awards coming back to NYC.\n\nCBS\n\nHe even roped in Sting and Shaggy \u2014 who, for some reason, have made an album together \u2014 to sing the Police classic 'Every Breath You Take' and the 2000s banger 'It Wasn't Me' on the subway too.\n\nTurns out New Yorkers don't want to hear Sting, Shaggy, Corden or anyone else singing to them on their subway ride, as you can see in the hilarious clip below:\n\nReactions ranged from angry passengers shouting at them, rolling their eyes or throwing money at them in order to get the trio to shut the hell up.\n\n\"We're not begging,\" a disheartened Corden complained. \"We're trying to create a viral moment.\"\n\nBetter luck next time, Jimmy! The 60th annual Grammy Awards aired live on CBS on Sunday (January 28) from the historic Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
