Friday, was accused by a woman of facilitating her sexual assault.\n\n\u201cAn allegation has been made against a contestant on next week\u2019s episode of \u2018The Proposal.\u2019 While the accusation was not related to the contestant\u2019s appearance on the program, we take it very seriously. ABC and the producers of \u2018The Proposal\u2019 are pulling the episode while this matter is under review,\u201d ABC and Warner Horizon said in a joint statement Friday.\n\nThe contestant in question was eliminated in the first round, but was accused by Milwaukee resident Erica Denae Meshke on Facebook of being \u201cdirectly responsible for my date rape.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Ratings: ABC's 'Proposal' Premiere Probably Wishes It Didn't Engage With 'American Ninja Warrior'\n\nIn a Facebook post, Meshke wrote that she and the contestant met on Tinder, and when they met, he left her alone with two older men, who then spiked her drink and took her to an apartment, where \u201cthe things I endured for the next 5 hours were unspeakable.\u201d\n\nShe said that she ran into him later, and confronted him about the incident.\n\n\u201cOnce I reminded him of who I was, he acknowledged his part in that evening, and tried to argue with me and justify what he did, but was promptly asked to leave the bar by employees/my friends,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis man is the pretty face that is used as a lure to get girls into unsafe situations.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Bachelorette' Contestant Lincoln Adim Convicted of Indecent Assault and Battery\n\nThe accusation comes after current \u201cBachelorette\u201d contestant Lincoln Adim was convicted of indecent assault and battery in May for an incident that occurred in 2016. ABC declined to comment on Adim\u2019s conviction, but producers Warner Bros. TV said in a statement that \u201cNo one on \u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 production had any knowledge about the incident or charges when Lincoln Adim was cast, and he himself denied ever having engaged in or having been charged with any sexual misconduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe employ a well-respected and highly experienced third party who has done thousands of background checks consistent with industry standards to do a nationwide background check in this case,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe report we received did not reference any incident or charge relating to the recent conviction \u2013 or any other charges relating to sexual misconduct. We are currently investigating why the report did not contain this information, which we will share when we have it.\u201d\n\nDeadline was first to report to name the contestant as being Michael J. Friday. ABC did not release his name, and attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.\n\nSee Meshke\u2019s Facebook post below.\n\nEdit: I'm removing the original photo link this was attached to for sharing purposes.
