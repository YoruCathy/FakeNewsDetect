Clapton was promoting the film when he opened up about his health during a BBC Radio 2 interview.\n\nConfirming that he still plans to perform live, Clapton added: \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m concerned with now is being in my seventies and being able to be proficient. I mean, I\u2019m going deaf, I\u2019ve got tinnitus, my hands just about work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that people will come along and see me just because, or maybe more than because I\u2019m a curiosity,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know that is part of it, because it\u2019s amazing to myself I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to get on the bottom of the ladder every time I play guitar, just to tune it,\u201d Clapton explained. \u201cThen I have to go through the whole threshold of getting calluses [on the fingers] back, coordination.\u201d\n\nClapton has been open about health issues in recent years. Speaking to Classic Rock Magazine recently, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve had quite a lot of pain over the last year. It started with lower back pain, and turned into what they call peripheral neuropathy \u2013 which is where you feel like you have electric shocks going down your leg\u2026 I\u2019ve had to figure out how to deal with some other things from getting old.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the Radio 2 interview, Clapton spoke about his former alcohol habits, which included drinking \u201cspecial brew with vodka\u201d, and said that his new documentary shows \u201cthere\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see that it\u2019s a happy ending, it\u2019s like a redemption concept,\u201d Clapton said. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna go and see it, be prepared for a heavy ride.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Eric-Clapton.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Eric-Clapton-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Eric-Clapton.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Luke Morgan Britton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/eric-clapton-talks-health-issues-going-deaf-2218171", "title": "Eric Clapton opens up about health issues and going deaf", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Eric Clapton has revealed that he's \"going deaf\" while speaking about ongoing health problems in a new interview", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Eric Clapton opens up about health issues and going deaf | NME", "description": "Eric Clapton has revealed that he's \"going deaf\" while speaking about ongoing health problems in a new interview", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/eric-clapton-talks-health-issues-going-deaf-2218171", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Eric-Clapton.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Eric-Clapton.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2018-01-11T19:01:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Eric Clapton has revealed that he's \"going deaf\" while speaking about ongoing health problems in a new interview", "title": "Eric Clapton opens up about health issues and going deaf | NME", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Eric-Clapton.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515697291.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
