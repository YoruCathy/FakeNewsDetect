She was holding up two fingers. Lordt it's like when she was smelling the lemon. #Beyonce pic.twitter.com/tbbQ3gH02P \u2014 Damedashbk (@DameDashBEYk) February 2, 2017\n\nSo here is the fan theory, discovered by Buzzfeed, encapsulated in one handy tweet and a quick explanation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonce uploaded a snap of herself wearing an AC/DC top, but only showed the DC. DC = Destiny\u2019s Child. Boom.\n\nMichelle Williams uploaded a snap of the outfit she wore when she last performed with Destiny\u2019s Child at the Super Bowl, you know, just to remind us she was once in the group.\n\nYes Yes Yes! (Picture: Kevin Mazur/WireImage)\n\nOriginal DC member LaTavia has piped up too, telling her fans \u2018I have so much to tell you guys\u2019\u2026\n\nAnd lastly, other original LaToya shared a picture of the quartet together back in the day. What a strange time to suddenly do a flash back\u2026.or is it?\n\nTHEY. ARE. COMING. COACHELLA IS ABOUT TO BE LEGENDARY. pic.twitter.com/5RMCahlvAS \u2014 Getaway Car ? (@DaKingKK) December 12, 2017\n\nNow it\u2019s Kelly\u2019s move.\n\nCoachella would be the ultimate place for a reunion, especially as Beyonce had to pull out last year, what with being pregnant with twins and all, and is now headlining for 2018.\n\nCould our Destiny\u2019s Child dreams be coming true?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
