After welcoming daughter Stormi a little more than two months ago, Kylie Jenner revealed she thinks she needs to lose weight.\n\n\u201dI need to lose 20 pounds but this just looks too good!\u201d the 20-year-old reality star said in the background of a Snapchat of someone cutting freshly baked rolls on Thursday, April 5.\n\nJenner gave birth to her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott on February 1. After keeping a low profile throughout her pregnancy (she never even confirmed she was expecting), the Lip Kit creator opened up about her experience and even revealed in a since-deleted tweet that she gained 40 pounds when she was pregnant.\n\nmy angel baby is 1 month old today A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Mar 1, 2018 at 2:50pm PST\n\n\u201cthere really was no worst part! probably not being able to eat sushi lol,\u201d Jenner replied to a fan on Twitter who asked for \u201cdeets\u201d about her pregnancy on March 11. \u201cI had such a perfect experience. she moved a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Life of Kylie star also revealed her pregnancy cravings included Eggo waffles. \u201cEggos!!! I never liked them before i was pregnant & haven\u2019t had one since i had her. so strange! Lol,\u201d she tweeted at the time.\n\nJenner may think she needs to lose weight, but she has also showed off her post-baby body on multiple occasions, including at Tristan Thompson\u2019s birthday party on March 10, and on her Snapchat on March 25.\n\nAs previously reported, the Kylie Cosmetics creator received backlash for posting a photo using a Waist Gang Society waist trainer less than two months after giving birth. Amid the controversy, Texas-based Ob-Gyn Dr. Cynthia Robbins told Us Weekly that Jenner should avoid wearing the product.\n\n\u201cA waist trainer is a very tight garment that can be clinched tighter and tighter to pull in the floating rib and anatomically compress,\u201d she explained to Us. \u201cAfter the delivery of a baby, the body has had ligaments and cartilage softened by a hormone named Relaxin. This hormone has been produced at the end of pregnancy to allow for structure shifting as the baby moves through the birth canal. I advise patients to wear a support wrap or belly wrap postpartum to stabilize the patient\u2019s pelvis so that it is held in place and no longer shifts.\u201d\n\nWhile Jenner may be hoping to shed her pregnancy weight soon, a source previously told Us Weekly that 25-year-old Scott \u201creassures her there\u2019s no need to hide her body.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kylie-jenner-stormi-nails.jpg?crop=74px%2C0px%2C889px%2C467px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-jordyn-woods.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kylie-jenner-stormi-nails.jpg?crop=74px%2C0px%2C889px%2C467px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/kylie-jenner-says-she-needs-to-lose-20-pounds/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Says She \u2018Needs to Lose 20 Pounds\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kylie Jenner revealed via Snapchat on Thursday, April 5, that she thinks she needs to lose weight after giving birth to daughter Stormi \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Says She \u2018Needs to Lose 20 Pounds\u2019\u00a0After Stormi", "description": "Kylie Jenner revealed via Snapchat on Thursday, April 5, that she thinks she needs to lose weight after giving birth to daughter Stormi \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/kylie-jenner-says-she-needs-to-lose-20-pounds/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kylie-jenner-stormi-nails.jpg?crop=74px%2C0px%2C889px%2C467px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kylie-jenner-stormi-nails.jpg?crop=74px%2C0px%2C889px%2C467px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Body", "published_time": "2018-04-06T21:59:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kylie Jenner revealed via Snapchat on Thursday, April 5, that she thinks she needs to lose weight after giving birth to daughter Stormi \u2014 get the details", "title": "Kylie Jenner Says She \u2018Needs to Lose 20 Pounds\u2019\u00a0After Stormi", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kylie-jenner-stormi-nails.jpg?crop=74px%2C0px%2C889px%2C467px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523051955.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
