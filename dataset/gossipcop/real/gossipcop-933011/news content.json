(Photo: Principia/Splash News )\n\nJohn Boyega and Letitia Wright were the perfect pair at Monday\u2019s Met Gala.\n\nWhen the Star Wars actor, 26, picked up the Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther actress, 24, at the Carlyle hotel en route to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the fashion megaevent, he \u2018shipped her appropriately. \u201cLook at her! Look at her! Look at her!\u201d he gushed as she climbed into the car all pumped up. \u201cLook at this! You look ahhhh.\u201d His video cuts off before he finished, but we\u2019ll go ahead and finish for him: You look ahhhh-mazing.\n\nJohn Boyega is truly worshiping Letitia Wright the way she deserves! pic.twitter.com/YLajcg1IuZ \u2014 tha'challa iw spoilers (@wakandapwr) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyega and Wright walked the famous stairs red carpet, posing together perfectly. They partied together inside, with Wright marveling at all the \u201cblack excellence\u201d at the event. Note: You may need sunglasses before hitting Play, \u2019cause there\u2019s a lot of star power in these videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut really before they even made their way up the staircase, the internet had basically already fallen in love with the pairing we didn\u2019t even know we needed.\n\nletitia wright and john boyega at the met gala (2018), oil on canvas, artist: god himself pic.twitter.com/PtH7DSlIFM \u2014 thor\u2019s gf pau (@tomshuri) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\njohn boyega and letitia wright, that's it that's the tweet \u2014 nazifa (@walIylinda) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nJOHN BOYEGA AND LETITIA WRIGHT ???

The main one being: Yes, they\u2019re a pair on the red carpet, but are they also a romantic pair?\n\nwait Letitia Wright and John Boyega are really together? \u2014 allison (@AlliApplebum) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Boyega and Letitia Wright are dating?!?!? \u2014 Caden Mark Gardner (@cadenmgardner) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a great pair!! Are they dating?

I need a movie with these two costarring immediately. pic.twitter.com/4of88lR3x1 \u2014 Kathryn America (@marvel_kathryn) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThe internet also merged their movie taglines because of course the force should be with Wakanda.\n\nI totally ship John Boyega and Letitia Wright now. May the force be with Wakanda \u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Cierra (@blissfulhoying) May 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what is the deal? Boyega later wrote on Instagram that, before they were famous, he and Wright, who both grew up in London, used to talk \u201cabout the future in McDonald\u2019s after drama classes.\u201d He ended the post with, \u201cLook at God and look at this amazing woman.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we loved that story hard, but we were still confused. Friends? Lovers? What\u2019s up? Let\u2019s toss it to Wright.", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0dwXRK33jMQRsH6_QIQJ4A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO2ZpPWZpbGw7dz04NDtoPTg0O2lsPXBsYW5l/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-17/711f88c0-b37f-11e7-8353-c582c6383d28_oath_suzybyrne_03_7589.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3ZynyrV0vHk0j1EFxxUVTA--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjU3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d93b53084157663fb406a5bbc71db908", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hBwaibSQb4Pe9joo_xfhlQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzU2O2g9NjU4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f35ef5253ef15d08c5e64a45a4e65119", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MmTg0vpWy_kZxL0jhZX7DQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d93b53084157663fb406a5bbc71db908"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3ZynyrV0vHk0j1EFxxUVTA--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjU3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/d93b53084157663fb406a5bbc71db908", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/john-boyega-letitia-wright-internets-new-favorite-couple-couple-163552007.html", "title": "John Boyega and Letitia Wright are the internet's new favorite couple, but are they a couple?", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The internet quickly fell in love with the pair John Boyega and Letitia Wright, who hit the red carpet together at the Met Gala.
