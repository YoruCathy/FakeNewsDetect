After taking on the intense role in The Wolf of Wall Street, she opened up about her thoughts on nudity in film and why she was okay with it in that particular movie. She spoke with The Telegraph, saying, \"I think nudity for the sake of nudity is shameful ... If they've put it in just so that a girl gets her top off, then that's disgusting. And you can always tell ... But I also think it's disgusting when someone would have [gotten] naked in real life, [but] in the film they conveniently leave their bra on, or hold up the bed sheet.\"\n\nShe stayed true to the role and knew what she had to do in order to fully become her character. She said, \"The whole point of Naomi is that her body is her only form of currency in this world. So when Marty [Scorsese] was trying to help me out, and said in the scene where she seduces Jordan, perhaps I could have a robe on, I said she wouldn't. She has to be naked. She's laying her cards on the table.\" And Robbie's not looking back. She continued on to say that the decision to take on that role was one she'll \"never regret.\"", "images": ["https://img2.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/she-knew-what-she-wanted-from-a-young-age-1502481527.jpg", "https://img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "https://img4.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "https://img.thelist.com/img/thelist_logo_black_2.svg", "https://img.thelist.com/img/thelist_icon_black.svg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img4.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Madormo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thelist.com/55191/stunning-transformation-margot-robbie/", "title": "The stunning transformation of Margot Robbie", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img4.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "title": "The stunning transformation of Margot Robbie", "description": "Actress Margot Robbie isn't just a pretty face \u2014 she's seriously talented and she's had an interesting life.
