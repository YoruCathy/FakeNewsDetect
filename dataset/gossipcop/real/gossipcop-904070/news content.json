In case you haven't heard, he's really big on catching fans trying to take pics of him. He has compiled the funniest cases on his super famous Instagram account called Camera Duels. And to make things even more interesting, each pic is paired with a caption that offers a play-by-play of the encounter.\n\nWell, it looks like fans are taking it to the next level. Janani Krishnan was googling the Riverdale star at an ice cream shop, and Cole was quick to notice. So, he captured the moment and posted the pic on his Instagram story. Naturally, it went viral.\n\nBefore you jump to conclusions though, let Janani explain herself.\n\n\"I was waiting in line when I turned around and saw someone who looked eerily like Cole Sprouse,\" she told BuzzFeed. \"I almost told him he looked a lot like Cole Sprouse, but then I realized that it might actually be him. Because I wasn't 100% sure yet.\"\n\nAnd as usual, Cole was a good sport about the whole thing. After a few laughs, the two eventually took a selfie.\n\nSo lesson learned. If you think you see Cole Sprouse, you're probably right!\n\nVictoria Rodriguez is a fellow at Seventeen.com.
