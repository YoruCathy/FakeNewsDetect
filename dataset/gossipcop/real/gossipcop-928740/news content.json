Kardashian previously said on Instagram the collection was over a year in the making, because the duo totally changed directions with their concept for the products.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it was going to be just lips and we were going back and forth about the packaging, and for both of us in the moment, it didn\u2019t feel fully right. We ended up creating something totally different from what we were talking about before,\u201d the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said. \u201cWe decided to do three eyeshadow palettes and a lip to go with each palette. And then came the packaging, which is also completely different from what we originally imagined last year.\u201d\n\nLooking for more style content?

My sisters and I used to do bright colors on our eyelids with eyeshadow. So I think having the red and green colors included in the collection as well as this yellow gold metallic is calling back to makeup that I\u2019ve doing since forever and comes out when I\u2019m in the mood to play with makeup,\u201d Kardashian explained.\n\nBut she also made sure to mix in multiple neutral shades in the three palettes to ensure she could create any look, from the most natural to dramatic.\n\n\u201cKylie was the one who really wanted to do the three eyeshadow palettes, and I loved that idea because it gave us a chance to be more creative with the whole thing,\u201d Kardashian said.\n\n\u201cAlso all of the metallics are so great, and it\u2019s more about how you choose to apply them. You could do a metallic look and then put a gloss over them or really you could apply them and keep them toned down and neutral. I really do think these palettes can do both!\u201d\n\nAs for collaborating with Jenner on the line, Kardashian said her sister is \u201d very opinionated when it comes to her makeup line\u201d but made sure to incorporate her ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the red color, I was very inspired by geishas because we had just been in Japan and all of the geishas we had met had red eyeshadow,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cKylie would say her vision for this collection and then I would chime in with my ideas, and then after we came up with the products, it was easy to tweak here and there without any tension. In the end, we would both agree on everything.\u201d\n\nSo far, no one else in the KarJenner krew has tested out the products, but Kardashian said she\u2019s most excited for her sister Kim to give her feedback on everything.\n\nKardashian said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear their opinions. I think especially Kim because she loves beauty and has her own line, so I can\u2019t wait to give it to her and hear what she thinks.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkourtney_v_look1-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkourtney_v_look2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkourtney_v_look1-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkourtney_v_look1-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kourtney-kardashian-poses-nude-v-magazine/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Poses Nude for V Magazine to Promote Kylie Cosmetics Collaboration", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Beauty,Beauty News,Kardashians,Kourtney Kardashian,Kylie Jenner,Magazine Covers,Makeup,News,Style,Style News", "news_keywords": "Beauty,Beauty News,Kardashians,Kourtney Kardashian,Kylie Jenner,Magazine Covers,Makeup,News,Style,Style News", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian promotes her Kylie Cosmetics collaboration launching April 24 with a nude shoot for V Magazine", "og": {"title": "Kourtney Kardashian Poses Nude for V Magazine to Promote Kylie Cosmetics Collaboration", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/kourtney-kardashian-poses-nude-v-magazine/", "description": "Kim Kardashian West isn\u2019t the only KarJenner who loves a good nude photoshoot.
