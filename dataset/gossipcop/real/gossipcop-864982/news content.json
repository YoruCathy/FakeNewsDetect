For the label\u2019s Cruise 2019 collection, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri based her collection on the beautiful clothing worn by Mexican Escaramuza Charra riders. However, Chirui\u2019s inspiration fell flat when her clothing appeared on Dior\u2019s face, Jennifer Lawrence. Now, both Dior and Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.\n\nEscaramuza is a traditional Mexican sport that is comprised of 10 to 16 women on horseback doing choreographed dancing and stunts to Mexican music. The sport first began at the birth of the Mexican revolution, during which women were allowed to participate and appear at the front of the battle in their traditional dress.\n\nThe wardrobe of the Escaramuza is as beautiful and precise as their routines, and an Escaramuza team must adhere to strict guidelines when crafting their uniform. Frills, shawls, ornaments, boots, and hats are all musts, and give fashion labels like Dior a lot to drool over.\n\nHowever, by putting Jennifer Lawrence \u2014 who is neither Mexican nor Latina \u2014 in clothing inspired by such culturally important dress for Mexican women has many questioning whether or not Dior cares about the cultural significance of the Escaramuza at all.\n\nLawrence said in a behind-the-scenes clip from the photoshoot featured on Dior\u2019s Instagram, \u201cOne of the main inspirations of this collection is the traditional women riders of Mexico. I\u2019m really excited that this collection is looking at and celebrating these women\u2019s heritage through such a modern lens.\u201d\n\nMany fault Dior for lacking the wherewithal to cast a Mexican model as the face of the collection. Although Lawrence should have seen through the culturally appropriative problem, it\u2019s more disappointing that Dior is just that oblivious.\n\nDior did feature a team of Escaramuza, wearing uniforms from Chirui\u2019s collection, in the the label\u2019s Cruise 2019 fashion show. However, the models presenting the inspired clothing on the runway were primarily white. It\u2019s a bit boggling how Dior completely missed the mark.\n\nThis cultural appropriation slip up is an obvious reminder that the fashion industry still has a long road ahead of them in terms of diversification and inclusion. Labels must become more aware of the impact they have on culture and society, and do more to make formative statements with their collections.", "images": ["https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/header/assets/search_icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dior.png", "https://trc.taboola.com/1238672/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/icon-yt.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-email-icon.svg", "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dior.png", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-pinterest-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-twitter-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/header/assets/logo.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/icon-ig.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/icon-fb.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy-child/icon.png", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-facebook-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/recommended-reads/recommended-reads-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/close.svg"], "top_img": "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dior.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madelyn Pariser", "Maggie Clancy", "Kish Lal", "Bailey Cox", "Deirdre Durkan"], "canonical_link": "https://itsblossom.com/jennifer-lawrence-trouble-clothes-ad/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is In Serious Trouble For The Clothes She\u2019s Wearing In This Ad", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Appearing as the face of Dior's Cruise 2019 collection, both the label and Jennifer Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is In Serious Trouble For The Clothes She's Wearing In This Ad", "description": "Appearing as the face of Dior's Cruise 2019 collection, both the label and Jennifer Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.", "url": "https://itsblossom.com/jennifer-lawrence-trouble-clothes-ad/", "site_name": "Blossom", "image": "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dior.png"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://business.facebook.com/firstmediaeverandivy/?business_id=994419303964527", "tag": "Trending Topics", "section": "Fashion", "published_time": "2018-11-15T18:04:57-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Appearing as the face of Dior's Cruise 2019 collection, both the label and Jennifer Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is In Serious Trouble For The Clothes She's Wearing In This Ad", "image": "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dior.png"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-icon-270x270.png", "google-site-verification": "eNxZEqOrclkXqsRgDqKOH6rmYzOOsjyiAYX7NNOE9YQ"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/whY-5h4w6Ok"], "publish_date": 1542333897.0, "source": "https://itsblossom.com", "summary": ""}
