She was a person who took delight in hurting you.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr. Phil asked what she loved most about her mom, the singer replied: \u201cWhat I love about my mother is that she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nSinead \u2013 who has battled with her mental health for a number of years \u2013 reportedly asked Dr. Phil to be interviewed just a month after she shared an emotional video on Facebook where she hinted at having suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe Grammy winner posted the 12-minute footage on Facebook in early August, revealing she was all alone and struggling to live every day.\n\nWeeping, Sinead said: \u201cI\u2019m all by myself.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s absolutely nobody in my life except my doctor, my psychiatrist, the sweetest man on Earth, who says I\u2019m his hero, and that\u2019s about the only thing keeping me alive at the moment\u2026 and that\u2019s kind of pathetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am now living in a Travelodge motel in the a**e end of New Jersey,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI want everyone to know what it\u2019s like, that\u2019s why I\u2019m making this video.\n\n\u201cMental illness, it\u2019s like drugs, it doesn\u2019t give a s*** who you are, and equally what\u2019s worse, it\u2019s the stigma, it doesn\u2019t give a s*** who you are.\n\nThe Irish singer has previously revealed her health struggles, having to undergo emergency surgery in 2016.\n\nThe star also sparked concerns last year when she disappeared for more than 36 hours after going on a bike ride in Chicago.\n\nFollowing her Facebook video, The DailyMail.com revealed Sinead is in a hospital in New Jersey and a pal also revealed on her Facebook page she is \u201csurrounded by love and receiving the best of care.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-139503556.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/the-sun_logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=84", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-139503556.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jill Robinson", "The Sun", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4426711/sinead-oconnor-dr-phil-interview-mother-abuse/", "title": "Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor is \u2018fed up\u2019 with being called crazy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
