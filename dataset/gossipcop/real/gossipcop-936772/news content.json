The Duchess of Cambridge stuck to her go-to designers and wore an Alexander McQueen dress and Philip Treacy hat for the occasion.\n\nTopping off her look, Kate accessorized with a matching fuchsia fascinator and veil paired with classic black pumps and a clutch. Her McQueen dress featured a pleated waistline and puffed sleeves. Typically one to stick to a neutral color palette, the look made for an unexpected splash of color for the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter arriving with Prince William, the couple shared a rare moment of PDA inside St. George's Chapel, holding hands sweetly as they sat in the pews.\n\nA sweet moment between Prince William and Kate Middleton! #RoyalWedding2 https://t.co/a7pqNEt6Ra pic.twitter.com/72mEsR5AhN \u2014 Yahoo Canada Style (@YahooStyleCA) October 12, 2018\n\nDuring the ceremony, the couple was seated without their two eldest kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, because the tots were busy serving as pageboy and bridesmaid in the ceremony.\n\nFor her last royal wedding appearance, at the May nuptials for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Kate also wore an Alexander McQueen dress.
