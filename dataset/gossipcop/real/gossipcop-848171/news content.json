Kim Kardashian, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kris Jenner team up against Scott Disick in a sneak peek from the Sunday, May 14, episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nIn the previous \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d episode, the Kardashians discovered that Disick, 33, had invited a girl named Chelsea along on the family trip to Costa Rica. During a group dinner, Kim, 36, and Khlo\u00e9, 32, started talking about Chelsea Handler and Chelsea Clinton in an attempt to get Disick to admit to his actions. When that didn\u2019t work, Jenner, 61, asked point blank: \u201cI think what we\u2019re all wondering is if you have a girl here and why?\u201d\n\nIn the preview, it appears the self-proclaimed Lord owns up to bringing Chelsea along on the tropical getaway. \u201cI did something wrong as always,\u201d he says. It seems Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Jenner don\u2019t accept his apology**, because they all throw water on Disick and completely douse him.\n\nAs Kourtney Kardashian \u2014 who shares kids Mason, 7, Penelope, 4, and Reign, 2, with Disick \u2014 drives off in a golf cart with her sisters, she says, \u201cThat actually made me feel better.\u201d\n\nBack in February, Us Weekly reported that Disick left Costa Rica a day early after the blowout fight. \u201cThe family is deeply disappointed,\u201d a source told Us at the time. \u201cKourtney is not upset that he\u2019s seeing other women. She\u2019s upset he would disrupt the family vacation with the kids there and the whole family there and hide a girl in the hotel.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardasian-scott-disick-zoom-4f94bf20-13c4-4062-a13d-3bd24e741450.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardasian-scott-disick-zoom-64293636-c136-40da-ba3a-a5e2cce5b012.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardasian-scott-disick-zoom-4f94bf20-13c4-4062-a13d-3bd24e741450.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kim-khloe-throw-water-on-scott-disick-for-bringing-girl-on-family-trip-w481318/", "title": "Kim, Khloe Throw Water on Scott Disick for Bringing Girl on Family Trip", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner throw water on Scott Disick for bringing a girl on the family trip to Costa Rica \u2014 watch what happens in the \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 preview!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim, Khloe Throw Water on Scott Disick for Bringing Girl on Family Trip", "description": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner throw water on Scott Disick for bringing a girl on the family trip to Costa Rica \u2014 watch what happens in the \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 preview!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kim-khloe-throw-water-on-scott-disick-for-bringing-girl-on-family-trip-w481318/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:08:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardasian-scott-disick-zoom-4f94bf20-13c4-4062-a13d-3bd24e741450.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardasian-scott-disick-zoom-4f94bf20-13c4-4062-a13d-3bd24e741450.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-05-08T20:10:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:08:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner throw water on Scott Disick for bringing a girl on the family trip to Costa Rica \u2014 watch what happens in the \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 preview!", "title": "Kim, Khloe Throw Water on Scott Disick for Bringing Girl on Family Trip", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardasian-scott-disick-zoom-4f94bf20-13c4-4062-a13d-3bd24e741450.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494274254.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
