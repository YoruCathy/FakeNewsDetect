Jake Gyllenhaal shared that his friendship with late actor Heath Ledger really started due to a \u201cmutual frustration.\u201d\n\nIn his latest profile for the February issue of GQ Australia, it was revealed that Gyllenhaal and Ledger \u2014 who passed away at the age of 28 in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs \u2014 both auditioned for the same role in 2001\u2019s Moulin Rouge, but they didn\u2019t get the part.\n\n\u201cI was auditioning for Moulin Rouge! Baz Luhrmann had chosen three actors. It was Ewan [McGregor], it was Heath, and me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe auditioned with many different actresses, it was a long process. But I never met Heath, I only heard about him. We would be shuffled in and out of rooms. They would literally put me in a room and lock the door and Heath would come in and then Heath would be shuffled through the door. I never saw him.\u201d\n\nMcGregor was cast for the role, but the failure brought the Oscar-nominated pair together and helped them form a lasting friendship. They eventually ended up working together in 2005\u2019s Brokeback Mountain. \u201cWhen Ewan was cast, I finally met Heath and we sort of became friends before Brokeback Mountain based on our mutual frustration,\u201d Gyllenhaal revealed. \u201cWhen Brokeback Mountain came out and it got all the attention it did, I remember, a few months later, Heath called me and he was like, \u2018Hey mate, I got some news for you\u2019. I said, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Southpaw actor continued: \u201cHe said, \u2018Baz just offered me his next movie. I just wanted you to know, I f\u2013king turned it down!\u2019 So that was how much Heath loved me, you know. That was how I met him.\u201d\n\nOn January 22, 2008, Ledger was found dead in his New York City apartment. The Dark Knight actor dated his other Brokeback Mountain costar Michelle Williams \u2014 whom he met on the set of the film \u2014 but they split in August 2007. The duo\u2019s daughter, Matilda, now 12, is Gyllenhaal\u2019s goddaughter.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jake-gyllenhaal-reveals-how-he-first-met-heath-ledger.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jake-gyllenhaal-reveals-how-he-first-met-heath-ledger.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jake-gyllenhaal-reveals-how-he-first-met-heath-ledger.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jake-gyllenhaal-on-how-he-met-heath-ledger/", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal Reveals How He First Met Heath Ledger", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jake Gyllenhaal shared the story behind his friendship with late actor Heath Ledger and how it started after they both auditioned for 'Moulin Rouge' \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal Reveals How He First Met Heath Ledger", "description": "Jake Gyllenhaal shared the story behind his friendship with late actor Heath Ledger and how it started after they both auditioned for 'Moulin Rouge' \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jake-gyllenhaal-on-how-he-met-heath-ledger/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:03:54+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jake-gyllenhaal-reveals-how-he-first-met-heath-ledger.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jake-gyllenhaal-reveals-how-he-first-met-heath-ledger.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-01-11T23:04:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:03:54+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jake Gyllenhaal shared the story behind his friendship with late actor Heath Ledger and how it started after they both auditioned for 'Moulin Rouge' \u2014 details", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal Reveals How He First Met Heath Ledger", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jake-gyllenhaal-reveals-how-he-first-met-heath-ledger.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515711857.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
