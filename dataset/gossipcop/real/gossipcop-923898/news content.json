{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/29/scandal-retrospective-video/", "text": "Scandal type TV Show network ABC genre Thriller\n\nHere\u2019s to Scandal!\n\nIn a new video posted Thursday, the cast of Shonda Rhimes\u2019 presidential drama looks back over the past seven seasons on the hit show, shares gratitude for the series\u2019 diehard fans, and does a lot of behind-the-scenes dancing.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single feeling I haven\u2019t had about the show ending,\u201d says Kerry Washington, who plays the drama\u2019s lead Olivia Pope. Knowing this season would be the last, the cast has had the chance to make the most of the 18 episodes they had left to shoot to say goodbye to each other and their characters. \u201cAfter seven years of being together, we are very, very, very, very tight,\u201d adds Katie Lowes (Quinn Perkins) as the video flashes back to on-set moments celebrating landmarks and behind-the-scenes footage from the final episodes.\n\nAs for the last day of shooting? \u201cI think for our last day on set there will be lots of waterproof mascara,\u201d says Bellamy Young (Mellie Grant). Those tears might not be reserved for off-camera moments, as ultimately someone will be walking away brokenhearted. According to Scott Foley, Jake \u201cwould like to be back on the island with Olivia,\u201d but not if Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) has anything to say about it.\n\n\u201cNo, absolutely not,\u201d Goldwyn declares. \u201cI think Olivia\u2019s one true love is Fitz.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, it\u2019s likely there\u2019ll only be one truly happy person in the Scandal universe. \u201cThe only human that\u2019s guaranteed a happy ending is Shonda Rhimes,\u201d says Pope. They don\u2019t call it Shondaland for nothing, after all.\n\nSee if she\u2019s right by tuning in to ABC, Thursdays at 10 p.m. for the remaining four episodes of the series and watch the retrospective video above.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F13%2Fbetter-call-saul-1.jpg",
