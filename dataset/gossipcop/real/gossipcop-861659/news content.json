It comes almost two months after the monarch's actual birthday on April 21, which the family celebrates privately. But royals gotta royal, and as it turns out, there's a good reason for celebrating her birthday twice: The public-facing, formal festivities for a monarch's birthday are always held in the summer because the weather is more likely to be nice. Ah, to be queen.\n\nThis year, though, the tone was a little different: Queen Elizabeth began the day with a moment of silence acknowledging the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London. She also released a poignant statement via the Royal Family's official Twitter account: \u201cToday is traditionally a day of celebration. This year, however, it is difficult to escape a very sombre national mood. Put to the test, the United Kingdom has been resolute in the face of adversity. United in our sadness, we are equally determined, without fear or favor, to support all those rebuilding lives so horribly affected by injury and loss.\u201d\n\nCrowds caught glimpses of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, waving from the balcony.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/594536ec9b3c3531def991e5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/royalfamily_troopingng.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594536eb8bb2814937a78c1f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/queen_tropping.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katemiddleton.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59454cf670a6543e4f78ef2d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/giphy.gif", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1476303834/glamour_20-times-kate-middleton-wore-a-coat-as-a-dress-and-looked-flawless.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594536ea9b3c3531def991e3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/katemiddleton_trooping.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594536ea1bd81a664b29cefd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/princewilliam_trooping.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/katemiddleton.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katemiddleton.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Reimel", "Erin Reime"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-middleton-was-pretty-in-pink-for-trooping-the-color-celebrations", "title": "Kate Middleton Was Pretty in Pink for Trooping the Color Celebrations", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Erin Reimel", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Kate Middleton wore a a pink Alexander McQueen dress to the Trooping the Color parade in honor of Queen Elizabeth II's ninety-first birthday.", "id": "59452aa28bb2814937a78c1b", "keywords": "celebrity style,kate middleton,buckingham palace,troop the color,manchester,royal style,royal family", "news_keywords": "celebrity style,kate middleton,buckingham palace,troop the color,manchester,royal style,royal family", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59452aa28bb2814937a78c1b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kate Middleton wore a a pink Alexander McQueen dress to the Trooping the Color parade in honor of Queen Elizabeth II's ninety-first birthday.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/katemiddleton.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/katemiddleton.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She even twinned with Princess Charlotte! \ud83d\ude0d", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katemiddleton.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Kate Middleton Was Pretty in Pink for the Queen's Birthday Celebrations", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-middleton-was-pretty-in-pink-for-trooping-the-color-celebrations"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "She even twinned with Princess Charlotte! \ud83d\ude0d", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/594537ebc50f631fb8db0ad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katemiddleton.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Kate Middleton Was Pretty in Pink for the Queen's Birthday Celebrations"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
