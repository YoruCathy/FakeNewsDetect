But I wasn\u2019t nervous. I was just excited, always staying longer than I needed because I was trying to prove myself \u2014 and then North came early! I was a brand new assistant who had no idea what to do with a baby, but we all moved into Kris\u2019 house, and she was the one who made it all feel okay and moved mountains for us,\u201d Shepherd recalled to the outlet.\n\nIn a recent episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim questioned Shepherd\u2019s close relationship with her sister Kourtney Kardashian.\n\n\u201cDo you find it weird that you\u2019re like \u2018wifey\u2019 with my assistant?\u201d Kim asked, leading Kourtney ask her sister, instead, if it bothered her.\n\n\u201cKind of,\u201d Kim responded. \u201cWhat if all of a sudden I became BFF with Megan? I think you would definitely be like, \u2018That\u2019s weird.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKourtney, 38, also revealed that Shepherd confided in her about her job during their night out.\n\n\u201cJust a heads up, we were talking and she was saying that she didn\u2019t know what she wanted to do in life,\u201d the eldest Kardashian sister shared. \u201cShe feels, like, maybe she\u2019s in a place in life where she\u2019s unfulfilled, job-wise.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI feel like she\u2019s just looking to, like, evolve.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Reveals She Can\u2019t Carry Any More Kids\n\nAlthough she was visibly shocked, Kim agreed that Shepherd had taken a step back in tasks such as styling. However, she said she has been given other opportunities, like helping to run the reality star\u2019s Kimoji app.\n\n\u201cBut I do think it\u2019s like inappropriate for her to talk to you and not to me,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI mean don\u2019t you think that\u2019s like a little bit unprofessional?\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZFA-8iDOqc/?hl=en&taken-by=kourtneykardash\n\n\u201cKourtney and I weren\u2019t really close at all when I first started working, I don\u2019t think she really liked me at first to be honest!\u201d Shepherd confessed during her Refinery 29 profile. \u201cWhen we were doing that world tour of Miami and Iceland and all those places, with so much travel time, we bonded. Now we talk all the time and we\u2019ll go to dinner, or I\u2019ll spend the night at her house. People always think we\u2019re either lesbians, because we\u2019re always together or holding hands, or that I am Kourtney, I guess because we look alike and have a similar style.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1332&h=697&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F05%2Fstephanie-shepherd-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F05%2Fstephanie-shepherd-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F02%2Fkim-k-steph-shep-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1332&h=697&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F05%2Fstephanie-shepherd-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Leonard", "Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-parts-ways-with-assistant-stephanie-shepherd/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Parts Ways with Assistant Stephanie Shepherd", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "description": "\"Stephanie [Shepherd] wanted to transition into a larger role with Kim [Kardashian West]\u2019s brand and businesses, it just didn\u2019t work,\" a source tells PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Parts Ways with Assistant Stephanie Shepherd", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-parts-ways-with-assistant-stephanie-shepherd/", "description": "Kim Kardashian West&nbsp;is without her longtime right-hand girl.
