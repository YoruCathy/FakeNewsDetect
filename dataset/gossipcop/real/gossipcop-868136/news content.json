Campbell at one point curled her left hand into a fist, suggesting the Royal Beheaders might not see eye to eye on everything\n\nMilestone: The model and Diddy are part of the first all-black cast to have starred in a Pirelli calendar since 1987\n\nModel Duckie Thot plays Alice herself, posing upside-down with her feet on the ceiling in a too-small house after downing the magical Eat Me cookie.\n\nRuPaul is the Queen of Hearts. looking fabulous and menacing in a red dress while the King of Hearts (played by Blood Diamond star Djimon Hounsou) stands nearby. In another shot, RuPaul presides over a royal court, clearly not one to be messed with.\n\nNaomi Campbell and Sean 'Diddy' Combs take on the roles of the Royal Beheaders, looking nearly indistinguishable from a pair of stars in a late-90s rap video save for the axes in their hands.\n\n'That bold statement by Pirelli, I think, really goes against any ignorance,' Diddy said. 'People of color all over the world need to know that they're kings and queens, and I think that story of Alice in Wonderland puts that in that proper perspective.'\n\nAnd Whoopi Goldberg and albino model-lawyer Thando Hopa stand in as the Royal Duchess and Princess of Hearts, respectively.\n\n'When you think of the Pirelli calendar, I'm not the face that comes up,' Whoopi said. 'I know that. But girls, little girls like me wait to see someone who looks like me in a calendar. So, ta-dah!'\n\nRounding out the cast are model Slick Woods as the Mad Hatter, Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o as the Dormouse, American Honey actress Sasha Lane as the Mad March Hare, stylist Zoe Bedeaux as the Caterpillar, women's right activist Jaha Dukurehas the Wonderland Princess, model Adut Akech as the Quene of diamonds, rapper Lil Yachty as the Queen's Guard, and model and activist Adwoa Aboah as Tweedledee.\n\nModels Alpha Dia, King Owusu, and Wilson Oryema each play both gardeners and playing cards, while King also plays Tweedledum.\n\nStar-studded: Behind-the-scenes photos were first unveiled this summer\n\nKing of Hearts: They gave a peak at the whimsical set and costumes\n\nSomething different: New British Vogue editor Edward Enninful styled the shoot, which features an all-black cast\n\nQueen of Hearts: Reality TV star and drag queen RuPaul looks breathtaking as the fearsome red queen\n\nThe Mad Hatter: Taking on one of the best-known roles of the story is American model Slick Woods\n\nOwning it: RuPaul (pictured center as the Queen Of Hearts) admitted it took a lot of 'moxie' to pull off his costume\n\nRepresentation: 'When you think of the Pirelli calendar, I'm not the face that comes up,' Whoopi (pictured with Hopa) said. 'I know that. But girls, little girls like me wait to see someone who looks like me in a calendar. So, ta-dah!'\n\nThree-dimensional: Nyong'o was glad to be working with Walker, whose cinematic approach to photography agreed with her actor's mind. 'It's really cool to be in a moment where it's not just about the sexuality of my body,' she said\n\nEnninful got involved after Walker reached out to him to pitch the concept, at which point Enninful said taking part in the project was a 'no-brainer'.\n\n'It seemed like such a simple idea, the retelling of Alice in Wonderland with an all-black cast,' the Vogue editor added, looking back on the genesis of the calendar.\n\nWalker realized that the story of Alice In Wonderland had been told many times in the past, and this wanted to go back to the 'genesis' of the story told by Lewis Carroll in 1865.\n\nThe calendar is Campbell's fourth, and she noted that she did one in her teens, one in her twenties, another in her thirties, and the present one in her forties.\n\n'I'm just really happy as I'm someone that fights every day for balance and diversity in the modeling world. So to see this happen is absolutely beyond my wildest dreams,' the supermodel said.\n\nDiddy revealed he's had Alice In Wonderland quotes tattooed on his arms for five years, including a bit of dialogue that enabled him to put his 'own take' on the narrative. On his bicep, a conversation between Alice and Sean can be read, with Alice saying 'This is impossible' and Diddy responding: 'Nothing is impossible.'\n\nThe calendar also marks the first time worked with Walker, whose work she has always admired. She became so excited when he walked her through his concept she felt like she was having a 'mini heart attack'.\n\nRuPaul was equally enthusiastic about stepping into the Queen Of Hearts' shoes.\n\n'I'm so excited about my gorgeous costume that Edward has created for me,' he said. 'It's a lot of costume, and it takes a lot of moxie to pull it off. I think I can handle it though.'\n\nThe Drag Race host deemed being asked to be part of this year's calendar 'quite an honor', especially given the 'iconic' people he got to work with. 'But also just the story of Alice straddling two worlds and coming to terms with these two worlds and learning to navigate... I think it's very telling for anybody who's alive today,' he added.\n\nNyong'o was glad to be working with Walker, whose cinematic approach to photography agreed with her actor's mind.\n\n'It's really cool to be in a moment where it's not just about the sexuality of my body but it's about the intelligence, the sensuality, sometimes the innocence, the complication of my experiences as a human being,' she said.\n\nDukureh, who is better known for her work as an activist who raises awareness about female genital mutilation, child marriage, and violence against women, didn't expect to be asked to take part in the glamorous project.\n\n'Being here represents the untold stories of millions of girls who would never get an opportunity to do something like this,' she said.\n\nCreative

cookie\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/07/20/19/4282949300000578-4715302-Creative_team_Photographer_Tim_Walker_and_new_British_Vogue_edit-a-124_1500574382791.jpg",
