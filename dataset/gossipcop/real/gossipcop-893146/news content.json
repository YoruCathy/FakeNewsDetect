Their show, Xscape Still Kickin' It, premieres this Sunday, and we thought you just might need a refresher on one of the most iconic R&B groups in American music. After all, it has been almost 20 years. Here's everything that you need to know about Xscape.\n\n\n\nXscape Has 4 Members\n\nLike many other R&B groups of their time, Xscape has added and dropped a few members over the years. Today, the group is made up of 4 members: LaTocha Scott, Tamika Scott, Tameka \"Tiny\" Harris, and Kandi Burruss.\n\nThanks to Everyone for all of the beautiful birthday wishes\ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89#birthdaygirl #thankful A post shared by LaTocha (@iamlatocha) on Oct 2, 2017 at 9:49am PDT\n\nLaTocha sings mezzo-soprano\n\nTamika also sings mezzo-soprano\n\nThat Girl\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc Xscape tho..\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd my glam slays @latashawright & @bkluvsme A post shared by Majorgirl (@majorgirl) on May 8, 2017 at 12:33pm PDT\n\nTiny provides the soprano sound\n\nReady to hit the town to celebrate my #Essence cover! Thanks @sewjodie & @erika_lapearl_mua for getting me right for tonight! @houseofcb dress picked out by #NoIGJeremy A post shared by Kandi Burruss (@kandi) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT\n\nKandi rounds out the group with her contralto\n\nThey Were Super Successful in the '90s\n\nIf you were listening to music in the 1990s, it was likely that you were listening to an Xscape song at some point. People loved Xscape's unique sound and aesthetic because it was different from the typical R&B of the decade. From their debut single \"Just Kickin' It\" to the sexy sneakin' track \"My Little Secret,\" Xscape gave us hit after hit, each song diffferent from the others. The group released three albums during its run, and each of those albums went platinum. Xscape also had six top 10 hit songs on the Billboard Hot 100. So yeah--they're kind of a big deal.\n\nDrama Split Them Apart...\n\nThe price of fame proved to be too costly for the group, and tensions began to rise between the women at the height of their career. After their third album, the members of Xscape went their seperate ways, citing many different reasons and rumors including pregnancy, solo aspirations, and perhaps a romantic relationship with the label head of So So Def Recordings, Jermaine Dupri (scandalous!). The last time they would record together would be 1998.\n\nFollowing the split, the members decided to pursue solo careers. LaTocha and Tameka continued to sing together as Xscape while doing their own thing, LaTocha was cast in the second season of TVOne's R&B Divas: Atlanta, and Tameka sang on the soundrtracks for classic films like The Mask and Why Did I Get Married? Tiny would go on to co-write (with Kandi!) the Grammy-award winning TLC song \"No Scrubs\" as well as feature on several hip hop songs. She married Atlanta rap legend T.I. in 2010, and the Harris family recently wrapped up the sixth and final season of their reality show T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle on VH1. As for Kandi...well, you know. She's written and produced music, owns several of her own businesses, and currently stars on The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\n...But They're Back!\n\nIt may have taken them 20 years, but Xscape finally decided to get back together after several of the ladies apologized to each other for what had gone down. And now, they're making sweet harmonies and serving looks together on and offstage.\n\nThis pic describes how we felt when we found out our concert SOLD OUT in 1 DAY!!!!! Thanks to everyone in Detroit who bought tickets! We love y'all! Can't wait to hit the stage with #NEXT & #Total.

at 9/8c!", "images":
