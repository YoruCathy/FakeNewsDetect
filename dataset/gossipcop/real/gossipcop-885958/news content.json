In a recent episode, she was involved in a road rage incident in which she allegedly pulled a gun on a man after following him to his house. Jenelle denied the claims, though her 9-year-old son, Jace, who was in the car at the time, told her mother and his legal guardian, Barbara, that Jenelle did pull out the gun.\n\nFollowing the incident, Barabara was seen talking to Nathan Griffith, Jenelle\u2019s ex and the father of her son, Kaiser, about trying to get custody of all of her daughter's children.\n\nHere's more on the drama:\n\nJenelle Evans Threatens to Quit 'Teen Mom 2' After Controversies This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
