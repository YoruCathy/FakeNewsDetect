I love Deadpool. I can\u2019t wait to see the movie. You\u2019re one of my best friends. Blake, the fam, the whole thing. But back it up a little. Play a little hard to get. It\u2019s too much; it\u2019s not sexy.\n\nRELATED: Infinity War Directors Have the Perfect Response to Deadpool 2\u2019s Spoiler Letter\n\nJackman sort of made a cameo in 2016\u2019s Deadpool, in which Reynolds\u2019 Wade Wilson wears a cutout of his People\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d cover, and rumors persisted that the Merc With a Mouth might appear last year in a post-credits scene for Logan. However, those were shot down \u2014 and the James Mangold film didn\u2019t even have a post-credits sequence. The closest we got was the Deadpool teaser that played in theaters with Logan.\n\nThe two starred together in 2009\u2019s X-Men Origins: Wolverine. However, Reynolds has long pushed for a team-up movie with Jackman and to have him appear in Deadpool 2. Although the two recently shared some screen time to record a birthday message, there\u2019s no indication they\u2019ll team-up again any time soon, especially since Jackman retired from the role.\n\nRELATED: Is This Deadpool 2\u2019s Super-Secret Cameo?\n\nDirected by David Leitch, Deadpool 2 features Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as the voice of Colossus, and Karan Soni as Dopinder, with newcomers Zazie Beetz as Domino, Josh Brolin as Cable and Julian Dennison as Russell. The film opens May 18.\n\n171 Shares Share On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/assets/images/svg/tp-logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/pr-icon-light.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/assets/images/svg/ad-blocker.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/pr-part-of-1.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-deadpool.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/cbr-logo-color.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1639279299697145&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/themes/cbr/css/img/pr-go-premium-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-deadpool.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liam Nolan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215/https://www.cbr.com/hugh-jackman-tells-ryan-reynolds-play-hard-to-get/", "title": "Hugh Jackman Has a Message For Ryan Reynolds: \u2018Play a Little Hard to Get\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=3.0, width=device-width", "\u201cfb": {"app_id\u201d": "\u201c1682953215260932\u201d"}, "fb": {"pages": 119670598057754, "app_id": 1682953215260932}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cbr", "title": "Hugh Jackman Has a Message For Ryan Reynolds: 'Play a Little Hard to Get''", "description": "Hugh Jackman responds to Ryan Reynolds's attempts to have Wolverine and Deadpool team-up, saying, \"play a little hard to get.\"'"}, "description": "Hugh Jackman responds to Ryan Reynolds's attempts to have Wolverine and Deadpool team-up, saying, \"play a little hard to get.\"", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Hugh Jackman Has a Message For Ryan Reynolds: 'Play a Little Hard to Get'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215/https://www.cbr.com/hugh-jackman-tells-ryan-reynolds-play-hard-to-get/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Hugh Jackman responds to Ryan Reynolds's attempts to have Wolverine and Deadpool team-up, saying, \"play a little hard to get.\"", "site_name": "CBR", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215im_/https://www.cbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-deadpool.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 326}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ComicBookResources", "published_time": "2018-05-10T17:15:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-10T16:38:46+00:00", "author": "Liam Nolan", "section": "News", "tag": "deadpool 2, wolverine"}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180529170215if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTZ3a3LSJAQ?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1525972511.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
