She shares a last name with Spanish pop singer Becky G, but they aren\u2019t family members. What about Ross Lynch? He\u2019s got the same surname as Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch \u2014 but no, they\u2019re not siblings either. Wait, what about Originals star Claire Holt and Kickin\u2019 It alum Olivia Holt \u2014 are they related? Nope! Shay Mitchell and Maia Mitchell aren\u2019t family members either, despite sharing the same name. And Stranger Things star Gaten Matarazzo and The Princess Diaries actress Heather Matarazzo don\u2019t share any genes, contrary to popular belief!\n\nThere are plenty more where that came from! Scroll through our gallery to uncover all the other pairs of celebrities who have the same last name but aren\u2019t related, and prepare to be shook.\n\nLove J-14?
