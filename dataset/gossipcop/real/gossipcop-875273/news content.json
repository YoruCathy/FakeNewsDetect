Barose raves about the ColoreScience Mineral Corrector Palette. \"You can use these to brighten under eyes, to correct redness on lids, or to blend shades together to perfectly hide discoloration. It's powder, so it mis with the warmth of your skin, leaving you with smooth, sheer coverage.\"\n\nFind the Right Formulation\n\n\"When picking a corrector, color alone is not enough. The depth of the chosen shade is also key. For example, if you have darker skin, pick a deeper green. Pastels have too much white in them and will be too light for those skin tones.\"\n\nConceal As You Would Normally\n\n\"Use these bright hues to correct the color and then cover it with your flesh-tone liquid foundation or sheer concealer. These are all meant to be worn under makeup. And always use sheer concealer when you're layering over a corrector because you don't want the end product to look too thick, especially around your eyes.\"\n\nNow make like a painter and color your canvas to correction perfection!\n\nRelated: How Do I Properly Cover Acne with Makeup?\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc4/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-intro.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eden Univer", "Eden Unive"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/color-correcting-concealer", "title": "Color-Correcting Concealers: A Cheat Sheet", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Eden Univer", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Turn yourself into a mix master with these expert tips on applying color-correcting concealers.", "id": "55829c6d941a95530d044bca", "keywords": "makeup,beauty products,concealer", "news_keywords": "makeup,beauty products,concealer", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "55829c6d941a95530d044bca", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Turn yourself into a mix master with these expert tips on applying color-correcting concealers.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Turn yourself into a mix master with these expert tips.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "A Cheat Sheet for Color-Correcting Concealers", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/color-correcting-concealer"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Turn yourself into a mix master with these expert tips.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "A Cheat Sheet for Color-Correcting Concealers"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
