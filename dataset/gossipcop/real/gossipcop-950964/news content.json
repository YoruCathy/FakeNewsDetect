It might have been fun for us but not for the team behind the hit HBO series.\n\nIn order to prevent something like this happening again, the Emmy Award-winning show has taken extreme measures this year. Code names, secret sets, disappearing scripts \u2014 Game of Thrones has gone to great lengths to keep secrets for its upcoming final season.\n\nAccording to E Online!, rumour had it that multiple endings were being shot to throw off spoiler spies, but starlet Maisie Williams denied anything remotely close to happening on her appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.\n\n\u201cWell, I heard this, and I immediately thought, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got the budget to shoot lots of different endings\u2019,\u201d Williams said.\n\nHowever, Williams\u2019 co-star and onscreen sibling, Sophie Turner revealed what actually happened to keep the secrets of season eight. Turner confirmed the reports of self-destructing scripts (they wouldn\u2019t blow up, this isn\u2019t a movie), but said \u201cit\u2019s all true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, we wouldn\u2019t get anything physical. We would have it on an app. We would get sent sides for the scenes we were shooting the next day. So we would have to learn it all the day before,\u201d Turner told Digital Spy. \u201cAnd once you\u2019d read it, it disappeared 24 hours later, and you could never access it again. It\u2019s tighter than the White House security!\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s comments support what Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister on the show, had previously said about the scripts. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very strict. It\u2019s reached a crazy level this year,\u201d he revealed to Esquire. \u201cWe actually get the scripts and we shoot the scene but we only have it digitally and when you\u2019ve done the scene, it just vanishes. It\u2019s like Mission: Impossible\u2026\u2018This will self-destruct\u2019.\u201d\n\nNot just this but visitors on the set would be asked to cover their phone cameras to avoid any pictures being taken. Also, the cast had code names as well, Turner revealed, so that nobody would know who was really on set that day. The show itself also had a code name too: Face of Angels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a random one!\u201d the actor had said.\n\nAs for the ending, Coster-Waldau said he was satisfied. \u201cI also know that we end the right way and the show ends on its own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I read the scripts for the last season I was like, \u2018Wow, they really pulled it off\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe cast has been paying tribute to the series as production comes to an end. Williams recently marked the end of filming with a bloody Instagram post, Turner got a tattoo to commemorate her time on the series and Emilia Clarke penned an emotional note to Belfast, the country they filmed in.\n\nGame of Thrones returns to HBO in 2019.\n\nHave something to add to the story?
