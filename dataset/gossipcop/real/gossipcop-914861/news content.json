It\u2019s hometowns week which means we get to see the people who will be most embarrassed by the contestants\u2019 appearances on this show! Shall we get right to it?\n\nFirst up, Rachel travels to Baltimore to meet Eric\u2019s family. Eric is super creepy and purrs at Rachel, but she doesn\u2019t seem to mind. Then some guy shows up for a few minutes to talk about Rachel before he disappears.\n\nMore screen time than Adam and Matt combined.\n\nI can\u2019t pay too much attention to this conversation because I\u2019m distracted by how good Eric looks with just a little bit of facial hair.\n\nMore of this Eric, please!\n\nWith that, Rachel becomes the first woman that Eric has ever brought home and his family is just straight up delightful! Seriously, I want to hang out with them always \u2013 especially his Aunt Verna.\n\nVERNA FOR BACHELORETTE!!!\n\nWhen Rachel talks to Verna, they discuss how Rachel is being judged by the black community as well as by the white community in this situation. Eric\u2019s conversation with his mom seems super scripted, but that\u2019s not really that surprising based on what he\u2019s told us about their relationship. Rachel talks to Eric\u2019s mom next and it\u2019s just a lot of complimentary stuff about Eric. Honestly, the more I watch this date, the more I like Eric. I was iffy about him in the beginning, but I\u2019ve grown to really love him. Why couldn\u2019t we have seen this Eric the whole time?\n\nHere\u2019s to you, Eric!\n\nOf course, this ends with Eric saying \u201cI love you\u201d because we\u2019re at that point in the season. Ugh, but then he ruins it by purring at Rachel again. Never mind. I hate Eric again.\n\nEw. We have to hang out with Bryan and he quotes Will Smith at her.\n\nYou\u2019re not that cool, Bryan.\n\nThey go to Domino Park and this is when I realize that Bryan is winning this thing. The big tell is the effortless way that Rachel just calls him \u201cbaby.\u201d That\u2019s what I remember about Andi\u2019s season \u2013 she only gave a pet name to Josh.\n\nI can\u2019t not point out that Bryan\u2019s shirt is hideous.\n\nAfter all that, it\u2019s time to meet the infamous mother that broke up Bryan\u2019s last relationship.\n\nAw. Bryan and his mom got matching cheek implants\n\nBryan\u2019s mom is just as terrifying as you\u2019d imagine. I\u2019m not sure why his family think it\u2019s not possible to be threatened by his relationship with his mother. She seems like she has boundaries issues. If a guy\u2019s mother straight up says, \u201cIf he\u2019s not happy, I\u2019ll kill you\u201d you bet your ass I\u2019m going to run screaming in the other direction. This date is a whole bunch of nothing and Bryan gives the obligatory \u201cI love you.\u201d Awesome. Let\u2019s move on to something more interesting.\n\nOh, thank God that\u2019s over. Rachel is off to Madison, Wisconsin to meet Peter\u2019s family. They start the day by walking around the farmer\u2019s market while we continue his \u201cguy who has doubts\u201d edit. After that, Rachel and Peter head to a bar where they meet his friends and they talk about Peter having a lot of black friends.\n\nNope. Totally not an awkward conversation.\n\nPeter spends a little time with just his guy friends and he expresses his doubt again, This totally has to be the \u201cnext Bachelor\u201d edit, right? There\u2019s always this type of edit for the next lead. It just makes me laugh that he keeps saying that he doesn\u2019t like to move fast with relationships. Does he realize what show he came on? Peter is so pretty, but kind of dumb.\n\nSo, let\u2019s move on to meet the parents!\n\nPeter\u2019s mom has \u201ccan I speak to your manager\u201d hair.\n\nThe whole date revolves around how great Peter is with his niece and nephew and how he has his walls up. This goes right along with Rachel wanting and engagement at the end of it all but wondering if Peter is ready. *Yawn.* Unfortunately, Peter doesn\u2019t give Rachel the \u201cI love you\u201d she wants and I think, for the first time all season, Peter is in danger of going home.\n\nOh, and now it\u2019s time for the main event \u2013 Dean\u2019s hometown date. I start off a little bit annoyed at Rachel and her constantly questioning why Dean hasn\u2019t reach out to his father to fix their relationship. Look, I\u2019m very lucky when it comes to my family life. I have a wonderful relationship with my parents. However, I have some friends who aren\u2019t quite as lucky. While I\u2019ll never understand how they feel, I know that the parent-child relationship can be complicated. I don\u2019t think Rachel\u2019s questioning came from a place of trying to pressure Dean, just a place of ignorance. I don\u2019t think she can wrap her head around his life because it\u2019s so far from her own experience. Granted, I think a lot of the questioning came from producers. I can easily imagine them telling her something like, \u201cHe just needs a little encouragement to talk to his father!\u201d\n\nAt least there are ATVs, so there\u2019s that.\n\nThe meeting with Dean\u2019s father and stepmother just makes me angry at ABC. I really think that this was neither the time nor place for Dean to confront his dad for the first time in two years. I also feel a little bit bad for Dean\u2019s father. My guess is he thought this was going to just be a generally meeting of the girlfriend and then Dean (likely giving into pressure from the producers) sprung an impromptu therapy session on him. Now, I\u2019m not saying that Dean\u2019s dad is completely blameless when it comes to their strained relationship. The two of them clearly have a lot to work on if they want to be in each other\u2019s lives again. However, I just think that this show exploited a very complicated and painful situation for the sake of ratings Between Racist E. Lee earlier in the season and this, I\u2019m completely over the ABC producers and the BS they\u2019ve pulled.\n\nOh, and Dean, of course, tells Rachel he\u2019s falling in love with her.\n\nAnd, holy shit! Rachel says she\u2019s falling in love with him too!\n\nAnd now we move into the rose ceremony. The top three are\u2026\n\nBryan\n\nEric\n\nPeter\n\nDean\u2019s exit is pretty cold. I completely understand that he\u2019s pissed that Rachel dumped him right after saying she was falling in love with him. While that was a crappy thing to do, I have to remember that 1.) there\u2019s never a good time to dump someone and 2.) my guess is Rachel was trying to just comfort Dean in that moment so she said the most caring thing she could think of.\n\nI\u2019m kind of saddened by all of the hate Rachel has been getting after this episode. I see all these comments about how it was wrong of her to send Dean home after such a devastating hometown date. Seriously? So, Rachel should keep Dean around because she feels bad for him? That\u2019s kind of a shitty thing to do. My guess is that Dean was always going to be the next to go home. Unfortunately, it just happened at this point. As most past leads have said, they knew their final pick pretty early on in the season. At this point, very little is going to change that. It was never going to be Dean as the last one standing.\n\nThis happens every season \u2013 the audience starts to turn on the lead. People were pissed that Chris dumped Jade after learning about her Playboy past. Kaitlyn got a lot of shit for not dumping Nick before he picked out a ring. JoJo was hated for sending Chase home immediately after he said \u201cI love you\u201d during the fantasy suite date. Even Ben \u2013 this franchise\u2019s golden boy \u2013 got a lot of hate for sending Amanda home immediately after meeting her kids. This is all just par for the course \u2013 each season there is a fan favorite who gets dumped and the audience gets pissed off and starts sending hate filled and threatening comments to the lead on social media. Besides, if the rumors I\u2019m hearing about Paradise are to be believe, then Dean is definitely over it.\n\nSo, that\u2019s it, Trashies! We\u2019re so close to the end! At least this season is somewhat interesting compared to the last few snoozefests we\u2019ve had.\n\nUntil next time, Trashies!\n\nWant more TrashTalk?
