The boxer\u2019s August 2017 fight versus Conor McGregor generated more than $550 million in revenue, with Money Mayweather earning $275 million, securing him the No. 1 spot for the second year since 2015. George Clooney ($239 mil) is in the No. 2 spot after British liquor giant Diageo purchased Casamigos, the tequila company Clooney cofounded, giving him the best annual take-home of his\u2014or any actor\u2019s\u2014career. Kylie Jenner ($166.5 mil) returns to the list at No. 3, a significant jump from the 2017 newcomer\u2019s spot at No. 59, followed by Judge Judy Sheindlin ($147 mil) at No. 4. Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson, earning $124 million, rounds out the top five.
