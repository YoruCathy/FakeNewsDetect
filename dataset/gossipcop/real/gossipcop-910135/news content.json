While the event shows recognition for the best music released in the past 12 months, the Grammys also takes time each year to pay tribute to the artists who have died over the past year.\n\nAs the 2018 Grammy Awards In Memorium montage was shown this year, SHINee fans noticed that Jonghyun was not included and quickly took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the singer's exclusion.\n\nIt has been previously explained by Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich that out of the hundreds of artists who have passed away each year, \"only about 50\" can make it into the Grammys In Memorium montage and each can only be on-screen for a few seconds. As for which artists make it into the montage, Ehrlich explained that it is decided by a committee of about 12 or 13 people from the recording academy.\n\nWhile Jonghyun didn't make it into the 2018 Grammy Awards In Memorium montage, the SHINee singer was listed on the official Grammy website's Memorium page.\n\nHear us on SBS PopAsia Digital Radio\n\nListen in 24/7 on Digital Radio, by downloading our free mobile app or by streaming live here on our website.\n\nDownload the app here:\n\n", "images": ["https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/thumb_small/public/girls-generation-tts.jpg?itok=39zkHEJd&mtime=1513128990", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/thumb_small/public/SBS_PopAsia_Blog_Profile_Page_3a_Default.jpg?itok=B3B8kjAN&mtime=1377566363", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/thumb_small/public/bts-v-15.jpg?itok=Qfhq90fq&mtime=1517266304", "http://www.sbs.com.au/radio/sites/sbs.com.au.radio/files/btn_store_android.png", "http://www.sbs.com.au/radio/sites/sbs.com.au.radio/files/btn_store_ios.png", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/full/public/shinee-jonghyun-9.jpg?itok=LENrNUyg&mtime=1538437796", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/profiles/sbsdistribution/themes/global/images/components/bean/radioplayer/channel-sbspopasia.png", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/fileQjMasx", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/thumb_small/public/d9515bc2-907c-4380-8364-bbbd5f48ac8e.jpg?itok=A_e9P9cA&mtime=1516675505", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/shinee-jonghyun-9.jpg", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/fileGnovPH", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/fileN5UIdB", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/thumb_small/public/tao7.jpg?itok=_wy7Wqti&mtime=1521521173", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/profiles/sbsdistribution/themes/popasia/images/vertical/transparent-wedge.png", "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/styles/thumb_small/public/shinee-jonghyun-9.jpg?itok=Ayqs1cen"], "top_img": "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/sites/sbs.com.au.popasia/files/shinee-jonghyun-9.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sbs Popasia Hq"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/01/30/shinee-fans-upset-jonghyuns-exclusion-2018-grammys-memoriam", "title": "SHINee fans upset with Jonghyun's exclusion from the 2018 Grammys In Memoriam", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "SBS PopAsia", "type": "website", "url": "https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2018/01/30/shinee-fans-upset-jonghyuns-exclusion-2018-grammys-memoriam", "title": "SHINee fans upset with Jonghyun's exclusion from the 2018 Grammys In Memoriam", "description": "Music's biggest night, the\u00a02018 Grammy Awards, took place last night (January 29) where it was attended by some of music's biggest stars.
