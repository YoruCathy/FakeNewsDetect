I wish you only the best. I don\u2019t want your money. I didn\u2019t do this to hurt you or your family. I did this for me, because I needed this healing.\"\n\n\"I also came forward because I want to inspire other victims, other people who have been assaulted to come forward and know that they have a voice,\" she added in this sneak peek at the upcoming episode.\n\nSchuman -- who was a member of the early 2000s girl group Dream -- came forward with allegations in a post on her personal blog earlier this month, in which she claimed that Carter raped her when she was 18 years old and he was 22.\n\nAfter the post was picked up by media outlets, Carter denied the allegations.\n\n\"I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman\u2019s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual,\" Carter said in a statement released to ET. \"We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally. This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.\"\n\nWhile speaking with Dr. Oz, Schuman claimed that she originally considered pressing charges against the popular boy band member, but was allegedly warned about the ramifications of coming forward.\n\n\"I\u2019d actually confided in my manager at that time about pressing charges. And I was told that he had the most powerful litigator in the country and that I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for an attorney to essentially defend me, if he were to come after me,\" she said.\n\nThe former singer further claimed that her manager told her, \"'Everyone\u2019s going to call you fame hungry, [and say] that you're trying to use this to better yourself or get your name out there and at this point there\u2019s nothing we can do.\"\n\nSchuman said in the post that she was invited over to Carter's house during a day off from filming a made-for-TV movie they were co-starring in -- 2004's The Hallow. She claimed that after arriving at his apartment with her roommate, they listened to the singer's new music before he allegedly brought her into the bathroom, where she claimed they started kissing.\n\nSchuman alleged that Carter started unbuttoning her pants, disregarding her objections before allegedly performing oral sex on her. She claimed he then demanded she perform oral sex on him, writing, \"My thought was the only way to get out was to get him to finish what he had started.\"\n\nSchuman stated that Carter then took her to the bedroom, where she alleges he raped her.\n\nShe further wrote that she didn't tell anyone about the alleged encounter for years, and even sang a duet with Carter before losing interest in a career as a recording artist.\n\n\"I feel I have an obligation now to come forward with the hope and intention to inspire and encourage other victims to tell their story. We are stronger in numbers,\" Schuman concluded her post.\n\nSchuman's sit-down interview on The Dr. Oz Show airs Friday.
