And now, six months later, it was announced that their home and a variety of personal items will be sold and auctioned off.\n\nThe Beverly Hills property the two shared will hit the market soon, according to Profiles in History auction house. It's an \"original 1928 hacienda-style home on 3.5 lushly landscaped acres secluded down a long gated driveway, passing by the home of Debbie Reynolds on premise, complete with a swimming pool, tennis court and detached guest house.\" It counts Oscar winners Bette Davis and costume designer Edith Head as past owners.\n\nThe auction of over 1,500 personal items is set for September 23, 2017, in Los Angeles and online, and will include many pieces for collectors and fans of the actors. A few notable items that will be available are Reynolds' replica of a pair of ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz, Fisher's life size Princess Leia statue in an original British phone booth, her personalized director's chair from Return of the Jedi, a life size, light up C-3PO, and a limited edition bronze Yoda statue. Outside of memorabilia, there will also be a suite of ornately carved antique Art Deco furniture from Carrie Fisher's childhood playhouse on the property of her family's Beverly Hills home.\n\nAccording to E!, Reynolds was something of a Hollywood historian herself, holding her own memorabilia auctions throughout her life.\n\n\"My mother and sister were magnificent collectors, they amassed an amazing and diverse collection in their lifetimes,\" Todd Fisher says. \"The size and scope of their collection rivals most museums. So in keeping with my mother's wishes we have decided to share part of their magnificent collection with all their friends and fans.\"\n\nYou can order a catalog of auction items through Profiles in History.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/https://ct.pinterest.com/?tid=0V9fl4kAlUN&value=0.00&quantity=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1837067156531602&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/08881b0cd977ee5d2e47773f0978406f0848f152?auto=compress&w=240&h=240&fit=crop", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?auto=compress&w=1033.0&fit=max", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?auto=compress&w=398.0&fit=max", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=531267817007380&ev=PixelInitialized", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-9e_lGUY-vZpsw.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?w=1500&fit=max", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=14868646&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=eobji1agq800Ux"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?w=1500&fit=max", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tara Bellucci", "Jun"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957/http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-estates-of-carrie-fisher-amp-debbie-reynolds-to-sell-home-amp-personal-items-246399", "title": "The Estates of Carrie Fisher & Debbie Reynolds To Sell Home & Personal Items", "meta_data": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "tGrwJpL3uYfUcZRoHSjzCePl2nk8w5mCzrJmq4WjrqK6xj3gMg2ZetgbgzsEtyHyBTbkWj8gQZINJrn27KnHQg==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "pinterest-rich-pin": "true", "description": "The two were considered \"magnificent collectors\".", "og": {"title": "Carrie Fisher & Debbie Reynolds' Home & More To Be Sold", "description": "The two were considered \"magnificent collectors\".", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957/http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-estates-of-carrie-fisher-amp-debbie-reynolds-to-sell-home-amp-personal-items-246399", "type": "article", "site_name": "Apartment Therapy", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?w=1500&fit=max"}, "fb": {"admins": 1917611, "pages": 30065974282}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/the-estates-of-carrie-fisher-amp-debbie-reynolds-to-sell-home-amp-personal-items-246399", "title": "Carrie Fisher & Debbie Reynolds' Home & More To Be Sold", "description": "The two were considered \"magnificent collectors\".", "site": "AptTherapy", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602201957im_/http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?w=1500&fit=max"}, "qc": {"section": "lifestyle"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ee2737", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/at/favicons/metro-tile-877df567364b7a12b6305de95121b79f6fa60f63b6beb964fd595656e09bca7f.png", "thumbnail": "http://atmedia.imgix.net/80bb1a6a1b1bac6d10519b90b157bd33056cdfbe?w=1500&fit=max", "msvalidate.01": "C4495FD94995DA49DD1DF57BF9A3A015", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
