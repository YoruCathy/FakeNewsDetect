File Photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo\n\nNov. 16 (UPI) -- Production on Veep's seventh and last season has been delayed as star Julia Louis-Dreyfus continues her battle against breast cancer.\n\nVeep executive producer Frank Rich gave an update on the actress Wednesday on Sirius XM radio show The Press Pool where he confirmed that production has been postponed as Louis-Dreyfus continues to receive treatment.\n\n\"I can tell you that Julia is undergoing treatment for breast cancer and we're obviously postponing production of the show. We were supposed to have started now while she's in treatment, but the expectation is that we will shoot again. We have one more season we're doing, which we're incredibly excited about,\" Rich said.\n\n\"Rather impressively, while we wait for her to gather her full strength, around her treatment, we've been having with the cast in Los Angeles, table reads of scripts for the final season as they're ready,\" he continued. \"So it's been quite something because she's fighting a serious, what is for anybody, a real illness, and yet, wants to keep working as much as circumstances allow without being crazy about it. I've seen her as recently as 10 days ago, and watched her just be hilarious playing Selina Meyer, with the cast all around her playing the assorted group of idiots that Selina has to deal with on a weekly basis on the show.\"\n\n\"She's got a great support system,\" he said. \"She's a very strong person and we can't wait to welcome her back at full speed.\"\n\nLouis-Dreyfus first announced she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September. \"1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I'm the one,\" she wrote at the time. \"The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring friends, and fantastic insurance through my union. The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let's fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement, Louis-Dreyfus received support and words of encouragement from a number of celebrities including her Seinfeld co-star Jason Alexander, breast cancer survivors Robin Roberts and Christina Applegate and former Vice President Joe Biden.",
