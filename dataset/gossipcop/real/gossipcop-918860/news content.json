Sobbing, he tried to make sense of the split during a confessional.\n\n\"I did love her,\" he said. \"I just thought she loved me back.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kufrin struggled with how much she hurt Horstmann, especially because she could empathize with his situation. Kufrin was famously blindsided earlier this year when former Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. ended their engagement on-camera. However, she also understands that the split was a necessary part of the process.\n\nBecca Kufrin and Garrett Yrigoyen are pictured on \"The Bachelorette.\" Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nBecca Kufrin and Garrett Yrigoyen are pictured on \"The Bachelorette.\" Paul Hebert/ABC\n\n\"It's impossible to really prepare yourself for a goodbye,\" she said. \"I do love Blake. He made me feel hopeful. He made me feel love again. But Garrett's the one for me. He's gonna be my teammate. He's gonna be the best partner. He's gonna stand by me every single day. He would be somebody that I could see my dad loving so much.\"\n\n\"I can picture it all: I can picture us being together,\" she continued. \"I can picture kids and him driving around in a minivan. And I can picture us taking care of one another whenever we're sick. God, I'm so ready for this.\"", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/becca-kufrin-abc-jpo-180807_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/becca-kufrin-abc-jpo-180807_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Lesley Messer", "August", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/bachelorette-becca-kufrin-engaged-garrett-yrigoyen-57069148", "title": "Bachelorette Becca Kufrin is engaged to Garrett Yrigoyen", "meta_data": {"description": "The reality TV star gave her final rose to either Garrett or Blake.", "keywords": "Reno, engagement, The Bachelorette, beaches, Nevada, Maldives", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
