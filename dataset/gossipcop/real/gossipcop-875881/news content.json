While the couple seemed picture perfect, for Bachelor Nation it was the break up we all saw coming. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDistance\n\nAbsence may make the heart grow fonder, but not when you barely know the person! Vanessa\u2019s from Canada and Nick lives in Los Angeles and from the start of their relationship (they knew each other for only six weeks before getting engaged) Vanessa seemed pretty apprehensive about leaving her family to start a life with Nick in L.A. While she did make the move, leaving her job as a special education teacher, Vanessa was back-and-forth between Montreal and the L.A. which no doubt affected their relationship.\n\nTheir After The Final Rose Appearance\n\nWho could forget the couple\u2019s most cringe worthy TV moment? Immediately following the airing of their proposal Nick and Vanessa had one of the most awkward post-engagement moments EVER.\n\nWhile they should have been in engagement bliss, Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi did more talking about their relationship problems than they did about how in love they were.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat things\u201d \u2014 please sugarcoat, please \u2014 \u201csome days are tougher than others, like any relationship,\u201d Vanessa admitted. \u201cWe\u2019re very honest with each other \u2014 I don\u2019t sweep anything under the rug, neither does he. \u2026 And it\u2019s been hard. You know, we live in two different countries, [and we\u2019re] starting a relationship where you don\u2019t get the chance to see each other every day and do normal things. When we do see each other, it\u2019s in a house. I love him, we love each other, but there are days that have been difficult.\u201d\n\nAnd just when you thought the difficult relationship talk was over, cue Nick\u2019s chiming in about their \u201cstruggles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are days that have been difficult.\u201d He also admitted, \u201cI\u2019m a realist, right?\u201d Yes, Nick, you keep it real, but, can you give us a little love talk, please? \u201cI think Vanessa and I continue to be that. As Vanessa mentioned, there\u2019s been those moments,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our struggles, but we\u2019re good communicators, and we talk. But we do try to be that team.\u201d\n\nTheir Chemistry\n\nWhile Nick and Vanessa made quite the good-looking couple they seemed to be missing that spark in their relationship.\n\nDiffering Career Paths\n\nNick seemed drawn to the spotlight while Vanessa looked like she hated all of the attention.\n\nDancing With The Stars\n\nAlmost immediately after The Bachelor wrapped Nick was onto his next show, Dancing With The Stars, which required him to spend HOURS away from his fianc\u00e9.\n\nThey\u2019re Two COMPLETELY Different People\n\nWhile on The Bachelor, Nick and Vanessa never seemed like they were on the same page.\n\nThey Met On Reality TV\n\nHello, they\u2019re a bachelor couple. The barely knew each other before making one of the biggest commitments two people can make. #BachelorCurse\n\nWedding Date\n\nNick never seemed like he wanted to get married. The former software salesman even revealed to Us Weekly in July that wedding planning was still on hold. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s always important to take things slow.\u201d\n\nDid you see Nick and Vanessa\u2019s split coming?
