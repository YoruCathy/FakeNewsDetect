But there were hundreds of other fans in the stadium over the weekend who didn\u2019t get the same attention but probably should have.\n\nSo, Swift gave hundreds of free tickets to local police officers and firefighters following the tragic death of Weymouth Sgt. Michael Chesna, who was shot and killed on July 15. The Patriot Ledger reported that Swift sent the town \u201ca significant number of tickets\u201d to her concert. And it was a hard ticket to get.\n\n\u201cThe gesture was absolutely generous, significant and appreciated,\u201d Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund told the Ledger, adding that Swift didn\u2019t do it for the press. Sure enough, Swift\u2019s camp hasn\u2019t said anything about the gesture when asked by the local media.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that they did it low-key and weren\u2019t looking for publicity,\u201d Hedlund said. \u201cThere were enough to send every police officer, firefighter and extended family to the concert, and then some.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a classy gesture by Swift for a grieving community and a great way to honor the men and women who serve.\n\nPlus, as an added bonus, it meant that if she got stuck up in a basket again there were fans who work in law enforcement there to help her. Maybe one of those fire trucks with the really big ladder.\n\nNow, we just have to try and find out if anybody has video of the police officers and firefighters freaking out like Hadid. I mean, really Gigi\u2026\n\nThen again, it was a pretty big deal: Swift is the first female to ever play Gillette.\n\n\u201cGetting to play here 1 time is insane. Getting to play here twice is insane. This is our 3rd night in a row playing at Gillette Stadium. Because of you, you\u2019ve made tonight the very 1st time a female artist has played 3 nights at Gillette Stadium.\u201d \u2013@taylorswift13 \u2014 Gillette Stadium (@GilletteStadium) July 29, 2018\n\nCongrats T-Swift.\n\n[h/t: WCVB]", "images": ["https://media.giphy.com/media/26gR0hw5iIHUClqcU/giphy.gif",
