Here are highlights of the trip that made their relationship official. See pics\n\nbollywood\n\nUpdated: Jun 29, 2018 09:44 IST\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas\u2019 week-long holiday in India has come to an end as the international actor and her rumoured boyfriend left for the US on Friday. However, while the duo were here in India, they kept us enthralled with their many appearances. From her and Nick\u2019s two dinner outing with her mother Madhu Chopra, their high profile Goa vacation and their show of love at the big fat Ambani engagement (Akash and Shloka\u2019s engagement party was held on Thursday in Mumbai), the power duo have been trending on the internet since day 1 of their arrival.\n\nIt was in India that the duo made their relationship Instagram official -- while Nick shared a video of Priyanka as she walked towards him, simply writing \u2018her\u2019 on it, Priyanka shared a photo of her \u2018favourite men\u2019 Nick and brother Siddharth from Goa. No surprise then that speculation suggests that before August is over, we will have Nick and Priyanka engaged to each other.\n\nPriyanka and Nick are also each other\u2019s \u2018plus one\u2019 these days. If Nick had the Quantico star with him as he attended his cousin\u2019s wedding, Priyanka -- looking red hot -- walked hand-in-hand with Nick at a pre-wedding bash hosted by Mukesh Ambani for son Aksha Ambani and Shloka Mehta.\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas pose for photos at the Ambani bash.\n\nPriyanka also hosted an intimate party for a select few of her industry friends which was attended by cousin Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt. Parineeti also accompanied them to Goa. Priyanka\u2019s mother had said then that she is still to know Nick better. A second dinner outing of the trio followed soon.\n\nPriyanka should be in India for her next Hindi film, Bharat, which will also star Salman Khan.\n\nCheck out these pictures from their India trip:\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas at Yauatcha restaurant BKC in Mumbai on June 22, 2018 where they met her mother, Madhu Chopra. ( Prodip Guha/ HT Photo )\n\nPriyanka and Nick have been spotted wearing matching purity rings and sources are insistent that an official confirmation of their relationship is not far away.\n\nNick and Priyanka are said to have first met at Met Gala 2017 where they appeared together on the red carpet in Ralph Lauren outfits. Priyanka had dismissed reports of them being romantically involved at that time.\n\nThe rumoured couple also attended the Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few weeks ago. In one of the pictures, the Baywatch star was seen stepping out of a car with Jonas opening the door for her.", "images": ["https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2018/06/29/Pictures/_baf7cc26-7b4f-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.JPG", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/06/29/Pictures/_c08d0da4-7b4f-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.JPG", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/delhi-cm-addresses-on-lockdown-extension_5bfdb98e-8209-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/ht-copy.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/06/29/Pictures/priyanka-chopra-and-nick-jonas_31970206-7b4c-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/illustration-picture-seen-india-firm-flipkart-commerce_37d032f6-8206-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_1608006a-81ff-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/img/app-images/HomePageV1/zero.gif", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_bd26cfbc-81ef-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/outbreak-hyderabad-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-in_045417ee-8206-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/2019/4/authors/logo-ht.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/htlogo.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/2019/4/authors/source_weather-cm.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/06/29/Pictures/_620c3672-7b51-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.JPG", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/default_author.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_49a7a3a8-8209-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.JPG", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/budget-session-in-parliament_b7c462fa-81f9-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/18d72aacafe84701a5b30e418a8a6611/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/security-in-srinagar_0ca25600-8200-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_7718e6c8-81e9-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_ffe09460-820c-11ea-bf35-36f2d834daf8.JPG", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_444x250/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/virus-outbreak-india_5ceba5dc-81f4-11ea-aedf-4d2519fcedc3.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2020/04/19/Pictures/_c87956a6-8207-11ea-a716-f322ae116ff6.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/06/29/Pictures/_c08d0da4-7b4f-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ht Correspondent"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-leave-india-here-are-highlights-of-the-trip-that-made-their-relationship-official-see-pics/story-8bJnoLAcjrgJq2Jn6diOtL.html", "title": "Nick Jonas, Priyanka Chopra leave India.
