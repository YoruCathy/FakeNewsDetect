Figure skater and America's sweetheart Adam Rippon also attended the gala with his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, making it their big official red carpet debut.\n\nGetty Images\n\nKajaala is from Finland and is a real estate broker and is just an extremely attractive human being, really.\n\n\n\nThe two started talking in October after Kajaala slid into Rippon's Tinder DM's with a smooth pickup line. Kajaala asked Rippon, \"Are you here for business or are you here just to meet me?\" Clearly it worked because the two have been dating for a few months now.\n\nThis is their first red carpet appearance together, but Kajaala has graced Rippon's Instagram feed multiple times. Here they are cruising through the ocean:\n\nBeing fit:\n\nJust being cute:\n\nAnd celebrating Pride:\n\nAnd while their red carpet debut was so cute, Rippon was focused on making sure people are aware of the Trevor Project's life-saving resources.\n\n\"I think now we should have a serious talk about mental health and suicide prevention,\" Rippon told E! News. \"I think it's important to remember that the Trevor hotline is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to anyone. Whether you know someone going through something or you're going through something yourself, it's open and available.\"\n\n\n\nThe Trevor Lifeline is open 24/7 at (866) 488-7386.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0620xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0620xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shannon Barbour", "News Writer", "Shannon Is A News Writer At Cosmopolitan.Com", "When She'S Not Obsessing About Cardi B", "She'S Thinking About Justin Bieber", "Still Trying To Memorize Beyonc\u00e9'S Beychella Choreography."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a21344416/adam-rippon-boyfriend-red-carpet-debut/", "title": "Adam Rippon and His Hunky Boyfriend Finally Made Their Red Carpet Debut", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Adam Rippon and His Hunky Boyfriend Finally Made Their Red Carpet Debut", "description": "No, it's not Gus Kenworthy.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a21344416/adam-rippon-boyfriend-red-carpet-debut/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0620xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-06-13 04:49:39", "published_time": "2018-06-13 02:43:00", "section": "Celebrities & Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0620xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Adam Rippon and His Boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala\u200b, Made Their Red Carpet Debut", "description": "Adam Rippon and his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala\u200b, made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Trevor Project's New York gala.", "keywords": "adam, rippon, boyfriend, real, estate, finland, finnish, figure, skater, rita, ora, lena, waithe, gus, kentworthy, trevor, project, gala, lgbtq, awareness, pride, suicide, prevention, crisis, intervention, hotline, phone, number, jussi, pekka, kajaala", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-13T14:43:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0620xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/adam-rippon-boyfriend-2-1528898894.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Adam Rippon and His Hunky Boyfriend Finally Made Their Red Carpet Debut", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528828980.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
