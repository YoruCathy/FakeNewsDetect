But this fucker wants to be tv married to a 38 year-old -TOPS.\u201d\n\nThough she declined to reveal the identity of the male actor or to specify which project she was talking about, she did note that the two characters have an 18-year-old daughter in the script.\n\nAlso Read: Zoe Saldana Says Sexism Is 'Much More Aggressive' Than Racism in America (Video)\n\n\u201cOld white men, enjoy your last run. We are all fucking done with you lizards,\u201d Denbo wrote last week.\n\nDenbo\u2019s story is similar to one shared by Maggie Gyllenhaal in an interview with TheWrap in 2015. Gyllenhaal described having been, at the age of 37, deemed too old to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man.\n\n\u201cThere are things that are really disappointing about being an actress in Hollywood that surprise me all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m 37 and I was told recently I was too old to play the lover of a man who was 55. It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Bill O'Reilly Accused of Racism, Sexism Over Maxine Walters, James Brown Diss (Video)\n\nDenbo\u2019s initial tweets were largely met with support, but others haven\u2019t been so kind. Denbo shot back at her critics on Monday with yet another tweet.\n\n\u201cHappy to report it took over 48 hours for the trolls to start harassing this \u2018spoiled, ugly, libtard actress,'\u201d she wrote. \u201cStep up your game boys!\u201d\n\nRead all of her tweets below:\n\nI was just informed that at the age of 43, I am TOO OLD to play the wife of a 57 year old. \u2014 Jamie Denbo (@jamiedenbo) May 4, 2017\n\nOh, the characters also have an 18 year-old daughter. I am TOO OLD to be the mother of an 18 year-old. \u2014 Jamie Denbo (@jamiedenbo) May 4, 2017\n\nThe real wife of the 57 year-old actor is EASILY AT LEAST 50. But this fucker wants to be tv married to a 38 year-old -TOPS. \u2014 Jamie Denbo (@jamiedenbo) May 4, 2017\n\nThis is a FIRST marriage, btw. Not a re-wife. Which would make a little more sense. \u2014 Jamie Denbo (@jamiedenbo) May 4, 2017\n\nOld white men, enjoy your last run. We are all fucking done with you lizards. \u2014 Jamie Denbo (@jamiedenbo) May 4, 2017\n\nHappy to report it took over 48 hours for the trolls to start harassing this \"spoiled, ugly, libtard actress\".
