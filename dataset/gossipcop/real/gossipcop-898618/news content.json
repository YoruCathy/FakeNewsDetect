Those close to Anna Faris couldn\u2019t be happier that she has found love again with beau Michael Barrett after splitting from husband Chris Pratt.\n\n\u201cThey are a great match,\u201d an insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. \u201cAll of her friends love him. He\u2019s so down-to-earth, stable and obsessed with Anna.\u201d\n\nThe cinematographer also has Faris\u2019 5-year-old son Jack\u2019s seal of approval. \u201cMichael is great with him and that\u2019s all Anna cares about,\u201d the pal says. \u201cThey are doing so well.\u201d\n\nBarrett, 47, and the Unqualified author, 41, first sparked romance rumors when they were seen together in Italy in November 2017. The duo were then spotted house hunting in Los Angeles the following month.\n\nFaris\u2019 Mom costar Allison Janney spoke about the relationship in December \u201cShe\u2019s got her new man who seems \u2026 She just seems great,\u201d the Oscar winner, 58, gushed to E! News. \u201cShe\u2019s doing really well and I\u2019m so happy for her. I met [Michael] once, he seems really lovely. I don\u2019t know him, but I\u2019m happy for her. If she\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nThe House Bunny actress and Pratt, 38, called it quits in July 2017 and he filed for divorce five months later. Faris opened up about coparenting their son Jack with the Guardians of the Galaxy actor during an exclusive interview with Us in January.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just the general idea of making sure that [Jack\u2019s] surrounded by a lot of love and happiness and we\u2019re really good at that,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe have amazing friends and incredible family and we just feel safe and protected and happy and so far he is. He\u2019s pretty hysterical.\u201d\n\nFor more on Faris and Barrett\u2019s romance, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-faris-and-boyfriend-michael.jpg?w=213", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/uw1218_cover_ns.jpg?w=222", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-faris-and-boyfriend-michael.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1279px%2C671px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-faris-and-boyfriend-michael.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1279px%2C671px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anna-faris-friends-approve-of-new-boyfriend-michael-barrett/", "title": "Anna Faris\u2019 Friends Approve of New Boyfriend Michael Barrett", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Anna Faris\u2019 friends are supporting her relationship with beau Michael Barrett, a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anna Faris\u2019 Friends Approve of Her New BF Michael Barrett", "description": "Anna Faris\u2019 friends are supporting her relationship with beau Michael Barrett, a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anna-faris-friends-approve-of-new-boyfriend-michael-barrett/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-08T01:11:51+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-faris-and-boyfriend-michael.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1279px%2C671px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-faris-and-boyfriend-michael.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1279px%2C671px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-08T14:00:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-08T01:11:51+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Anna Faris\u2019 friends are supporting her relationship with beau Michael Barrett, a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "title": "Anna Faris\u2019 Friends Approve of Her New BF Michael Barrett", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-faris-and-boyfriend-michael.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1279px%2C671px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520517649.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
