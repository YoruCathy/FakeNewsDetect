I\u2019m sorry, ladies \u2026 At the same time, you know what I mean, Jesus Christ, I don\u2019t know, they took everything from Louis, it might be disproportionate, I can\u2019t tell, I can\u2019t tell, this is like where it\u2019s hard to be a man.\u201d\n\nChappelle, 44, went on to address C.K.\u2019s incident with writer Abby Schachner, with whom he masturbated while on the phone. She told the New York Times that it was \u201cone of the things that discouraged her from pursuing comedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne lady said, \u2018Louis C.K. masturbated in front of me, ruined my comedy dreams,'\u201d he said of Schachner. \u201cWord? Well then I daresay, madam, you may have never had a dream. Come on, man, that\u2019s a brittle spirit. That is a brittle-ass spirit, that is too much, this grown-ass woman.\u201d\n\nHe continued, joking that Martin Luther King probably wouldn\u2019t have given up his \u201cdream\u201d if Louis C.K. masturbated in front of him.\n\n\u201cShow business is just harder than that,\u201d Chappelle said, bringing up Schachner again. \u201cThem women sound \u2026 they sound weak. I know that sounds f\u2013ked up, I\u2019m not supposed to say that, but one of these ladies was like, \u2018Louis C.K. was masturbating while I was on the phone with him.\u2019 B-tch, you don\u2019t know how to hang up a phone? How the f\u2013k are you going to survive in show business if this is an actual obstacle to your dreams?\u201d\n\nEarlier in his routine, he takes jabs at Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, who were both accused of sexual assault last year.\n\nChappelle\u2019s stand-up special was recorded in November at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2017_mathieubitton_mg_7067-edit_hr.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2017_mathieubitton_mg_7067-edit_hr.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2017_mathieubitton_mg_7067-edit_hr.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/01/01/dave-chappelle-says-louis-c-k-allegations-made-me-laugh/", "title": "Dave Chappelle says Louis C.K. allegations \u2018made me laugh\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
