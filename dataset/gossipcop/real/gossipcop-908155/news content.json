It\u2019s really Stassi, Brittany, and Katie versus Scheana, and Scheana really feels left out of everything.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, Scheana is upset about her current status with the other women but understands why they are against her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hurting her, however, Scheana really was spending so much time with Rob that she was acting like it was the Scheana and Rob show, and now they\u2019re not even together anymore,\u201d the insider explained.\n\nAs Vanderpump Rules fans will recall, Scheana\u2019s life revolved around her relationship with Rob Valletta for the entirety of season six and throughout their time together on the show, her co-stars expressed doubt in the longevity of the romance.\n\nIn addition to Scheana\u2019s reported feud with her co-stars, the insider said Billie is also on the outs with the cast and was recently involved in a dispute with her boss at SUR Restaurant, Lisa Vanderpump.\n\n\u201cBillie and Lisa also get into it, and it gets so bad that Billie is forced to go to Lisa\u2019s house to apologize,\u201d the source revealed. \u201cNone of the girls are speaking to Billie right now as well. They know Billie is really fighting for trans rights, and they whole heartedly support that, however, they feel she\u2019s really difficult to get along with.\u201d\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t noted what exactly led to Lisa and Billie\u2019s fight, the insider confirmed they are now on better terms.\n\n\u201cLisa knows what it feels like to not have anyone want to film with you, so Billie and Lisa have made up completely,\u201d the source said. \u201cBillie feels so excluded right now, and it\u2019s hurtful to her to not want anyone to film with her, which is why it was important to Billie to make up with Lisa.\u201d\n\nLisa has been in production on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season nine for the past several months but she hasn\u2019t been seen with her co-stars since September, when she attended Denise Richards\u2018 wedding, due to her feud with the cast.\n\n\u201cThe cast is just so divided right now. Producers are excited that the drama is high as is Lisa since this is her baby. She\u2019ll do this show forever as would the cast,\u201d the source continued of the Vanderpump Rules cast.\n\nAs for James, the insider added that the men and women of the show are no longer talking to the DJ and have been refusing to invite him to any of their group events.\n\nVanderpump Rules season seven premieres Monday, December 3 at 9 p.m. on Bravo TV.\n\nPhoto Credit: Charles Sykes/Bravo, Tommy Garcia/Bravo", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shiva-Safai-new-boyfriend-Niels-Houweling-plus-Mohamed-Hadid-e1574892714519-400x283.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/11/28/vanderpump-rules-billie-lee-feuded-with-lisa-vanderpump-during-filming-plus-cast-is-divided-behind-the-scenes/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-twitter-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-and-Kenya-Moore-plus-Shamea-Morton-e1587052289105-400x261.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scheana-Shay-and-mom-Erika-van-Olphen-400x278.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RHONJ-Joe-Giudice-and-Teresa-Giudice-News-400x281.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/white-logo1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1B.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vanderpump-Rules-Cast-vs-Billie-Lee-1024x640.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Melissa-Gorga-Getting-Her-Mail-Photos-3-400x250.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/feed-logo.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vanderpump-Rules-Cast-vs-Billie-Lee.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kyle-Richards-vs-Dorit-Kemsley-400x265.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/11/28/vanderpump-rules-billie-lee-feuded-with-lisa-vanderpump-during-filming-plus-cast-is-divided-behind-the-scenes/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-facebook-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/11/28/vanderpump-rules-billie-lee-feuded-with-lisa-vanderpump-during-filming-plus-cast-is-divided-behind-the-scenes/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-pinterest-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blurb-logo-1@2x.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/34feb98eadd86f8672383a21efe174f9?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RHOBH-Season-10-Premiere-Recap-Denise-Richards-Lisa-Rinna-and-Garcelle-Beauvais-400x248.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/11/28/vanderpump-rules-billie-lee-feuded-with-lisa-vanderpump-during-filming-plus-cast-is-divided-behind-the-scenes/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-instagram-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kenya-Moore-News-Update-e1577372761358-400x289.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kathryn-Dennis-plus-Thomas-Ravenel-News-400x263.jpg"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vanderpump-Rules-Cast-vs-Billie-Lee.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/11/28/vanderpump-rules-billie-lee-feuded-with-lisa-vanderpump-during-filming-plus-cast-is-divided-behind-the-scenes/", "title": "Vanderpump Rules Star Billie Lee Feuds with Lisa Vanderpump, Plus Cast Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#db0a5b", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Vanderpump Rules' Billie Lee Feuded with Lisa Vanderpump During Filming, Plus Cast Is 'Divided' Behind-the-Scenes", "description": "Vanderpump Rules star Billie Lee reportedly feuded with her boss Lisa Vanderpump during filming, plus cast is on the outs with Scheana Marie and James.", "image": {"identifier": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vanderpump-Rules-Cast-vs-Billie-Lee.jpg", "width": 1330, "height": 831}, "url": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/11/28/vanderpump-rules-billie-lee-feuded-with-lisa-vanderpump-during-filming-plus-cast-is-divided-behind-the-scenes/", "site_name": "Reality Blurb", "updated_time": "2018-11-28T17:54:27-06:00"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100014990620924", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/realityblurb", "published_time": "2018-11-28T17:54:27-06:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-28T17:54:27-06:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Vanderpump Rules Star Billie Lee Feuds with Lisa Vanderpump, Plus Cast Drama", "description": "The cast of Vanderpump Rules is said to be divided behind-the-scenes.
