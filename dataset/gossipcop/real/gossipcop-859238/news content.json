Maybe they were once beloved and just dragged on too long; maybe they were new shows that just didn\u2019t stick; or maybe, life just got busy. Variety\u2018s own staff had to leave a few series behind, whether they were finally giving up on Rick Grimes and co. on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d or saying goodbye to \u201cFriends From College\u201d in its first season. Here are their show-quitting confessions.\n\n\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d (Netflix)\n\nKnowing what we know now, my decision to break up with the political potboiler seems prescient. But I tuned out long before the Kevin Spacey revelations \u2014 when its fifth season premiered \u2014 and though the prospect of watching Robin Wright take center stage is certainly tempting, I\u2019ve already moved on. Blame it on the headlines. Blame it on the constant churn of the news cycle. But this political junkie gets enough of a fix from reality. \u2014 Debra Birnbaum\n\nMaybe \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d like your typical presidential term, should have ended after four years. Even before the Kevin Spacey allegations dropped, the Frank Underwood shtick was starting to feel old. As the show killed off more characters \u2014 and tainted the rest \u2014 who was left to root for? Robin Wright\u2019s electric charisma could only keep me hanging on for so long. But who am I kidding? As producers mull killing off Frank Underwood in its sixth and final season, the promise of Claire Underwood leading a (kind of) grieving nation may just yet pull me back in. \u2014 Alex Stedman\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (HBO)\n\nEndings are tough, and with a sprawling cast and a story spread out over several different mythical worlds, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d faces a unique challenge. Still, after deliberately and painstakingly laying out its warring Iron Throne aspirants over six seasons, the HBO show\u2019s creators are rushing to wrap things up with dizzying speed. That\u2019s led to some serious plot holes and pacing problems, as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has dispatched key characters to tie up loose ends across the Seven Kingdoms, often ignoring pesky issues of geography and travel time. For me, the show officially jumped the white walker when Jon Snow was sent to the other side of the Wall to capture a \u201clive\u201d wight in order to convince Cersei to join forces with hated enemy Daenerys to stave off the existential threat posed by armies of the undead. That scheme is ludicrous because Cersei has shown no taste for empirical evidence in the proceeding seasons and because a journey that would have consumed a 12-episode arc in previous years transpires over the course of a half hour. As loyal viewers know, the whole adventure ends with a late-in-the-game dragon rescue and me deciding to pack it in without finding out who will rule Westeros. \u2014 Brent Lang\n\n\u201cSanta Clarita Diet\u201d (Netflix)\n\n\n\nHaving grown up in the Santa Clarita Valley, it was always fun to point out locations in shows or movies that I recognized around town. Santa Clarita is so often used to represent other locations, and it\u2019s ironic that when a show is finally set in SCV, the town is almost unrecognizable. If you\u2019re using real businesses, why make up locations? And if you\u2019re going to make up locations why set the show in a real town rather than a fictional one? Much of the show\u2019s humor is dead on arrival, based on inside jokes about SCV life that non-residents probably won\u2019t fully grasp, recycled gags, or repetitive references to Drew Barrymore\u2019s character\u2019s undead vagina. While the show\u2019s premise had promise and its social critique of suburban life is often spot-on, clunky writing and lifeless performances from Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant kill any momentum before it even takes off. \u2014 Matt Fernandez\n\n\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d (AMC)\n\nWhen Glenn\u2019s brains hit the pavement, so did my heart. To be fair, even after that traumatic Season 6 premiere that bordered on torture porn, I stuck through it for 2016, dredging through every demoralizing episode. And it did get better \u2014 though it was painful to watch us lose Sasha as Sonequa Martin-Green moved on to \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d I cheered as Shiva mauled one of Negan\u2019s soldiers and Maggie led Hilltop in triumphant fashion in the finale. I thought that would be enough to reel me back in, since I was already hanging by a thread, but Season 7\u2019s slow start finally made me lose interest. It\u2019s not like I meant to break it off with \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d In fact, I fully intended to return to those episodes piling up on my DVR like wasted zombie bodies! But after I heard about a certain character\u2019s death in the Season 7 midseason finale, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s stress I want to put back on myself. \u2014 Alex Stedman\n\nDC on the CW (\u201cArrow,\u201d \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201cDC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow,\u201d \u201cSupergirl\u201d)\n\nAnti-hero series were quite the trend a few years ago, but these four series, each with varying degrees of roots in DC comic book characters, were designed to have the central figures be the heroes of the stories. However, all-too-often the heroes were the ones causing catastrophic complications \u2014 from Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) becoming Savitar to the Legends literally breaking time. While initially interesting as origin story missteps, as time (and seasons) went on, it became harder and harder to root for characters that kept putting selfishness above their supposed greater good. Similarly, it became hard to watch, let alone root for, shows that constantly put its core characters in life or death situations that it was obvious they would get out of due to contract statuses. It felt both emotionally manipulative and like low stakes, and the suspension of disbelief could not be sustained. \u2014 Danielle Turchiano\n\n\u201cBig Mouth\u201d (Netflix)\n\nTo put it simply, \u201cBig Mouth,\u201d which follows a group of seventh graders as they undergo the wonders of puberty, is an uncomfortable and cringe-worthy show whose juvenile humor is entirely comprised of sex jokes and disgusting visual gags. For a show packed with comedic talent, it\u2019s hard to believe that penis jokes wet dreams are the best that the likes of Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Jordan Peele, and Maya Rudolph have to offer. While it could be argued that the show\u2019s awkwardness and dirty humor mirror the experiences of the characters and teens going through that stage of life, prepubescent tweens are obviously not the target audience and edginess for edginess sake is never a good thing. \u2014 Matt Fernandez\n\n\u201cHomeland\u201d (Showtime)\n\nIt\u2019s not a popular opinion, but Quinn (Rupert Friend) should have died in Season 5. Instead, the show left him lingering in the hospital, only to have Carrie (Claire Danes) pull his pulse monitor off of his slack body in the hospital bed in the finale. Season 6 picked up a few months later \u2014 and Quinn was still very much alive, although impaired due to complications from a stroke. It felt like the show was just reluctant to lose an actor they so loved, and it also felt like a repeat of earlier season fake-outs regarding Brody\u2019s (Damian Lewis) own alive or deceased status. Too much of the same-ole-same-ole made this long-in-the-tooth-drama a victim to the era of Peak TV. \u2014 Danielle Turchiano\n\n\u201cNew Girl\u201d (Fox)\n\n\n\nThere was no particular reason why, but after Cece and Schmidt got together, I just lost interest in the show. It seemed to just meander on without a purpose. The lines weren\u2019t that funny, nothing seemed to happen. Every week, the DVR\u2019ed show would pile up and seemed to look at me accusingly. I knew there were five shows or more waiting for me, but they seemed to be a chore, like laundry that hasn\u2019t been put away. I finally deleted the series from my DVR. \u2014 Shalini Dore\n\n\u201cRay Donovan\u201d (Showtime)\n\nDear Ray: It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. I knew what I was getting into when I entered this relationship \u2014 that there was a limit to what you could give me emotionally. And though you did awful things, I always found it in my heart to forgive you. But I admit it: I started cheating on you. Other men came into my life with a bit less baggage, and given the choice between an antihero and a hero with heart, the good guys won. I know my timing wasn\u2019t great \u2014 I heard this season was rough for you (my condolences about Abby) \u2014 but just like you, I never meant to be truly cruel. \u2014 Debra Birnbaum\n\n\u201cModern Family\u201d (ABC)\n\nTo the Dunphy, Pritchett-Delgado, Pritchett-Tucker families \u2014 don\u2019t take it personal. The ABC family comedy at its best still delivers a deft mix of big funny and authentically poignant moments. But the situations, the hijinks, the what-goofy-thing-will-the-kids-do-next set-ups have grown predictable and retread. I stopped keeping up on a weekly basis about halfway through Season 8, and haven\u2019t checked in at all yet for Season 9. Like all messy family relationships, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll patch things up one of these days. \u2014 Cynthia Littleton\n\n\u201cRiverdale\u201d (The CW)\n\n\n\n\u201cRiverdale\u2019s\u201d first season was a great example of bad TV you loved to watch. It had a cheesy murder mystery, steamy teacher-student relationships, and enough melodrama \u2014 from the kids and adults of of the town alike \u2014 to weaponize. Unfortunately, the second season seems to have thrown out everything that made the show a quintessential guilty pleasure. In it\u2019s place is an increasing dark and brooding series with dialogue (which was admittedly never great) that is borderline impossible to sit through in some scenes. That and having the students of Riverdale form a group to hunt down the Black Hood is a bizarre move. Not every show in your lineup has to be a vigilante origin story, CW. \u2014 Jacob Bryant\n\n\u201cThe Deuce\u201d (HBO)\n\n\n\nThe prospect of another series from David Simon, creator of what many critics consider the greatest TV show of all time with \u201cThe Wire,\u201d had many salivating long before \u201cDeuce\u201d began on HBO. And it\u2019s certainly not a bad show; many of the individual performances are actually quite good. But as painstaking recreated as 1970s-era Manhattan is in all its seedy exoticism, no amount of production value can make up for the fact that the stories move way too sluggishly in those opening episodes. The milieu of pimps and porn stars also feels thoroughly picked over by pop-culture predecessors from \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d to \u201cBoogie Nights.\u201d The creative risk of having James Franco play twins doesn\u2019t work at all. Simon brings the same eye for the complexities of society\u2019s underclass that he always delivers. But \u201cDeuce\u201d just isn\u2019t great, and it suffers greatly in the shadow of \u201cWire\u201d regardless of whether that comparison is fair or not. \u2014 Andrew Wallenstein\n\n\u201cOzark\u201d (Netflix)\n\nAn actor as accomplished as Jason Bateman deserves to try his hand at drama, and it\u2019s great that Netflix gave him the chance. But while the actor is more than up to the task, the script does him a disservice; the Ozarks just doesn\u2019t make up for a particularly interesting setting for an entire series. Plus Laura Linney is thoroughly wasted in a role that in its first season doesn\u2019t feel multi-dimensional enough for someone of her caliber to inhabit. As for Bateman, his comedy acumen is so strong that it catches up to him; there\u2019s so many times where you want him to just wisecrack his way through scenes the way we\u2019ve known him do so ably over the course of his career. \u201cOzark\u201d should have better matched the man with the material to allow him to show off what he does best. \u2014 Andrew Wallenstein\n\n\u201cFriends From College\u201d (Netflix)\n\n\n\n\u201cParty Bus\u201d was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. It happened mid-way through the fifth episode of the eight-ep series. And you know there\u2019s no turning back when the show stops appearing on your Netflix \u201ccontinue watching\u201d queue. As much as I wanted to love \u201cFriends From College\u201d \u2014 considering that it was created and directed by Nicholas Stoller (\u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d) and Francesca Delbanco, and stars Keegan-Michael Key, Cobie Smulders, Nat Faxon, and Billy Eichner \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t bear it. I went from hate-watching the comedy to hating watching it. It\u2019s not the fact that the characters are so desperately flawed (I stuck by Don Draper, Walter White, and Frank Underwood) that\u2019s infuriating, but that we don\u2019t know why they\u2019re dysfunctional. The characters have no depth, leading to a shallow comedy that just isn\u2019t funny \u2014 plain and simple. The jokes fall flat, even when delivered by Key, and the pointless plot wears thin in no time. \u2014 Maane Khatchatourian", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/house.jpg?w=1000&h=563", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/homeland_612_3226-r.jpg?w=1024&h=768", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/modern-family.jpg?w=1000&h=667", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/variety-shows-we-quit-in-2017.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/walking-dead2.jpg?w=1000&h=563", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fshows-we-quit-2017-walking-dead-homeland-riverdale-1202645055%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202645055&comment_count=31", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/laura-linney-ozark.jpg?w=1000&h=562", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/variety-shows-we-quit-in-2017.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shows-we-quit-2017-walking-dead-homeland-riverdale-1202645055/", "title": "TV Shows We Quit in 2017", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Variety staffers reveal which TV shows they quit -- new or old -- in 2017.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202645055, "author": "Variety Staff", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-12-21T08:00:54"}, "pmc-tag": "Best of 2017", "title": "TV Shows We Quit in 2017", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TV Shows We Quit in 2017", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shows-we-quit-2017-walking-dead-homeland-riverdale-1202645055/", "description": "In general, it\u2019s advisable to finish what you start \u2014 but if what you started was a show that eventually felt more like an obligation than entertainment, who has the time to stick with \u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/variety-shows-we-quit-in-2017.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Variety Shows we Quit in 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-21T16:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-28T13:28:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@Variety", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "TV Shows We Quit in 2017"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/variety-shows-we-quit-in-2017.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "Variety Shows we Quit in 2017"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "TV Shows We Quit in 2017", "description": "Variety staffers reveal which TV shows they quit -- new or old -- in 2017."}, "author": "Variety Staff", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202645055, "title": "TV Shows We Quit in 2017", "published_at": "2017-12-21 08:00:54", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/variety-shows-we-quit-in-2017.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 31, "tags": "Best of 2017", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "In general, it's advisable to finish what you start -- but if what you started was a show that eventually felt more like an obligation than entertainment, who has the time to stick with it?\r\n\r\nAnd in the era of Peak TV, sometimes we have to sacrifice series in place of others.

Like all messy family relationships, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll patch things up one of these days. -- Cynthia Littleton\r\n\r\n\"Riverdale\" (The CW)\r\n\r\n\"Riverdale's\" first season was a great example of bad TV you loved to watch. It had a cheesy murder mystery, steamy teacher-student relationships, and enough melodrama -- from the kids and adults of of the town alike -- to weaponize. Unfortunately, the second season seems to have thrown out everything that made the show a quintessential guilty pleasure. In it's place is an increasing dark and brooding series with dialogue (which was admittedly never great) that is borderline impossible to sit through in some scenes. That and having the students of Riverdale form a group to hunt down the Black Hood is a bizarre move. Not every show in your lineup has to be a vigilante origin story, CW. -- Jacob Bryant\r\n\r\n\"The Deuce\" (HBO)\r\n\r\nThe prospect of another series from David Simon, creator of what many critics consider the greatest TV show of all time with \"The Wire,\" had many salivating long before \"Deuce\" began on HBO. And it's certainly not a bad show; many of the individual performances are actually quite good. But as painstaking recreated as 1970s-era Manhattan is in all its seedy exoticism, no amount of production value can make up for the fact that the stories move way too sluggishly in those opening episodes. The milieu of pimps and porn stars also feels thoroughly picked over by pop-culture predecessors from \"Taxi Driver\" to \"Boogie Nights.\" The creative risk of having James Franco play twins doesn't work at all. Simon brings the same eye for the complexities of society's underclass that he always delivers. But \"Deuce\" just isn't great, and it suffers greatly in the shadow of \"Wire\" regardless of whether that comparison is fair or not. -- Andrew Wallenstein\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ozark\" (Netflix)\r\n\r\nAn actor as accomplished as Jason Bateman deserves to try his hand at drama, and it's great that Netflix gave him the chance. But while the actor is more than up to the task, the script does him a disservice; the Ozarks just doesn't make up for a particularly interesting setting for an entire series. Plus Laura Linney is thoroughly wasted in a role that in its first season doesn't feel multi-dimensional enough for someone of her caliber to inhabit. As for Bateman, his comedy acumen is so strong that it catches up to him; there's so many times where you want him to just wisecrack his way through scenes the way we've known him do so ably over the course of his career. \"Ozark\" should have better matched the man with the material to allow him to show off what he does best. -- Andrew Wallenstein\r\n\r\n\"Friends From College\" (Netflix)\r\n\r\n\"Party Bus\" was the straw that broke the camel's back. It happened mid-way through the fifth episode of the eight-ep series. And you know there's no turning back when the show stops appearing on your Netflix \"continue watching\" queue. As much as I wanted to love \"Friends From College\" -- considering that it was created and directed by Nicholas Stoller (\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\") and Francesca Delbanco, and stars Keegan-Michael Key, Cobie Smulders, Nat Faxon, and Billy Eichner -- I just couldn't bear it. I went from hate-watching the comedy to hating watching it. It's not the fact that the characters are so desperately flawed (I stuck by Don Draper, Walter White, and Frank Underwood) that's infuriating, but that we don't know why they're dysfunctional. The characters have no depth, leading to a shallow comedy that just isn't funny -- plain and simple. The jokes fall flat, even when delivered by Key, and the pointless plot wears thin in no time. -- Maane Khatchatourian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariety's Best of 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD MORE", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513872054.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
