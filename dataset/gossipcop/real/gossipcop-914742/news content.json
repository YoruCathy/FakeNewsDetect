In a reversal of news she had broken earlier on Sunday, USA Today\u2019s Christine Brennan reported that the figure skater will not, after all, take a job with the network as a correspondent for the rest of the Winter Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u2018I am so flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent, but if I took this opportunity, I would have to leave the Olympic team and I would have to leave the [Olympic] Village,\u2019\u2019 Rippon said Sunday on NBCSN (via USA Today). \u2018\u2018It\u2019s so important to me, you know, I worked so hard to be on this Olympic team, and my teammates and my friends were there for me during my events, and that meant so much to me, that I really feel like I need to be there for them during their events.\u2019\u2019\n\nAn openly gay skater who helped the United States win a bronze medal in team competition, Rippon became one of the biggest breakout stars at Pyeongchang not just for his athletic exploits but for saying things that have been at turns smart, creative and refreshing for viewers. NBC had confirmed the news of its hiring of the 28-year-old Pennsylvania native, but he apparently had a change of heart.\n\nHiring Rippon would not have come without controversy for NBC. He is at odds with Vice President Mike Pence over gay rights and has said he will not go with the US team to visit President Trump if invited to the White House.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/ tr?id=884869448226452&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/d_WutsrSUz8HxvNnb5nkiADrUj0=/20x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IF3FMYQVDAI6RCWAH64ZQIGVWU.jpg", "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/pIXBV-VInuj-sGAGWnH_SKOS00Q=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IF3FMYQVDAI6RCWAH64ZQIGVWU.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035042&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/pIXBV-VInuj-sGAGWnH_SKOS00Q=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IF3FMYQVDAI6RCWAH64ZQIGVWU.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2018/02/18/adam-rippon-turns-down-nbc-gig-remain-olympian-through-games/OzZvQbSnUJLwlUSWqR0AZK/story.html", "title": "Adam Rippon turns down NBC gig to remain an Olympian through the Games", "meta_data": {"description": "", "keywords": "oly-tv-rippon-1stld-writethru", "arc": {"uuid": "BWKGQIAVDAI6RCWAH64ZQIGVWU"}, "robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-config": "/pf/resources/images/icons/browserconfig.xml?d=157", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "type": "article", "title": "Adam Rippon turns down NBC gig to remain an Olympian through the Games - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2018/02/18/adam-rippon-turns-down-nbc-gig-remain-olympian-through-games/OzZvQbSnUJLwlUSWqR0AZK/story.html", "description": "", "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/pIXBV-VInuj-sGAGWnH_SKOS00Q=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IF3FMYQVDAI6RCWAH64ZQIGVWU.jpg", "pixelID": 884869448226452}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BostonGlobe", "title": "Adam Rippon turns down NBC gig to remain an Olympian through the Games - The Boston Globe", "description": "", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2018/02/18/adam-rippon-turns-down-nbc-gig-remain-olympian-through-games/OzZvQbSnUJLwlUSWqR0AZK/story.html", "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/pIXBV-VInuj-sGAGWnH_SKOS00Q=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IF3FMYQVDAI6RCWAH64ZQIGVWU.jpg"}, "section": "Sports"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518883200.0, "source": "https://www.bostonglobe.com", "summary": ""}
