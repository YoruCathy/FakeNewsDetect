(Production assistants drove instead.) Prosecutors also allege that a Teamster attempted to block a vehicle carrying Lakshmi from entering Steele & Rye\u2019s driveway, telling the celebrity host something along the lines of, \u201cWe\u2019re going to bash your pretty little face in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe jurors have to decide whether the defendants\u2019 actions qualify as extortion.\n\nThe Teamsters had threatened to picket if \u201cTop Chef\u201d producers didn\u2019t hire union drivers, according to the Boston Globe, and defense lawyers have said the union members have a right to picket if they choose.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the life of America. People have a right to organize and demand things from employers,\u201d said Kevin Barron, Ross\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThere was no extortion, no crime, no conspiracy. . . . Just five middle-aged truck drivers doing a picket.\u201d\n\nProspective jurors were questioned about their \u201cfeelings on organized labor, lewd, sexist and racist language, and law enforcement,\u201d the Globe reported. The Teamsters, if convicted, could face sentences up to 20 years. (Mark Harrington, a fifth Teamster, pleaded guilty to attempted extortion in September and was consequently sentenced to two years probation and six months of confinement.)\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors have questioned the conduct of local police, too.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors stated on Friday that local police officers failed to intervene when the Teamsters allegedly harassed the \u201cTop Chef\u201d team, Deadline reported. Multiple witnesses have claimed the officers did nothing \u2014 no arrests were made following the incident \u2014 and the prosecutors showed photos of slashed tires on vehicles belonging to the \u201cTop Chef\u201d crew members.\n\n\u201cI got bumped from behind,\u201d production assistant Ian Buchanan testified on Friday, according to Deadline. \u201cI didn\u2019t see who hit me. A group of men cornered me. The police saw the skirmish. He told me to leave them alone. I was confused because I didn\u2019t start the altercation.\u201d\n\nLakshmi testified Monday morning that she was \u201cterrified\u201d when she arrived at Steele & Rye.\n\nAD\n\nLakshmi said the Teamsters had formed a line to block the vehicle from driving farther, the Globe reported, and that her driver \u201clooked terrified\u201d as well. One of the men approached the vehicle, verbally threatened Lakshmi and yelled something \u201cderogatory\u201d at the driver, she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to get out of the car, it was an uncomfortable situation to me,\u2019\u2019 she said, according to the Globe.\n\nAD\n\nThe court proceedings do not seem to have affected the show\u2019s future.\n\nThough a premiere date has yet to be announced, Bravo confirmed in March that the 15th season of \u201cTop Chef\u201d would take place in Colorado. Lakshmi will return as the host, according to Entertainment Weekly, along with judges Tom Colicchio, Gail Simmons and Graham Elliot.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/9624aab6-2742-4553-9ae0-96a331f3e138.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kj4zfuHIWqkQ7CbW5S2vtOAsPh0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MYSUOVWJ6A5ULLRTXHGNCVP5KE.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MYSUOVWJ6A5ULLRTXHGNCVP5KE.jpg&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kj4zfuHIWqkQ7CbW5S2vtOAsPh0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MYSUOVWJ6A5ULLRTXHGNCVP5KE.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/08/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-top-chef-extortion-trial/", "title": "Everything you need to know about the \u2018Top Chef\u2019 extortion trial", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Top Chef\" host Padma Lakshmi testified on Aug. 7 in a trial that pits the TV show against a group of Teamsters.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/08/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-top-chef-extortion-trial/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kj4zfuHIWqkQ7CbW5S2vtOAsPh0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MYSUOVWJ6A5ULLRTXHGNCVP5KE.jpg", "title": "Everything you need to know about the \u2018Top Chef\u2019 extortion trial", "description": "\"Top Chef\" host Padma Lakshmi testified on Aug. 7 in a trial that pits the TV show against a group of Teamsters."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Everything you need to know about the \u2018Top Chef\u2019 extortion trial", "description": "\"Top Chef\" host Padma Lakshmi testified on Aug. 7 in a trial that pits the TV show against a group of Teamsters."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-26T00:45:29.890Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502035200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
