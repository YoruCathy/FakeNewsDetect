The next two answers were tougher for the boys, who had to respond to what Rob's hidden talent was and what makes him laugh.\n\nThe family was on the show to promote their upcoming television series, The Lowe Files.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lorena O'Neil", "Lorena.Oneil Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rob-lowe-best-son-challenge-tonight-show-1024300", "title": "Rob Lowe's Kids Play the \"Best Son Challenge\" on 'The Tonight Show'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"Don't embarrass me,\" Rob tells his two sons.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rob-lowe-best-son-challenge-tonight-show-1024300", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Rob Lowe's Kids Play the \"Best Son Challenge\" on 'The Tonight Show'", "description": "\"Don't embarrass me,\" Rob tells his two sons.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Rob Lowe's Kids Play the \"Best Son Challenge\" on 'The Tonight Show'", "description": "\"Don't embarrass me,\" Rob tells his two sons.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rob-lowe-best-son-challenge-tonight-show-1024300", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Rob Lowe's Kids Play the \"Best Son Challenge\" on 'The Tonight Show'", "sailthru.description": "\"Don't embarrass me,\" Rob tells his two sons.", "sailthru.author": "Lorena O'Neil", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-25 13:19:52", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Jimmy Fallon,Rob Lowe,The Tonight Show,Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,Late-Night TV"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500959992.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
