The Real Housewives of New York City socialite confirmed the split during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Wednesday.\n\nShe elaborated a bit more about where things stand between her and her on-off beau and why in the video above, noting \"we break up all the time,\" among other inside info about their current status.\n\nWhen The Daily Dish caught up with Tinsley earlier this season, she spoke more about her relationship with the Internet CEO. \"He\u2019s one of my best friends,\" she said about the man she first met on RHONY last season after they were introduced by Carole Radziwill. \"And he will always be. We are super close.\"\n\nFans have always been deeply invested in their romance, from watching them meet for the first time on RHONY to watching them take another stab at it this season (clip below), which Tinsley totally finds flattering. \"It is always interesting when you\u2019re on a show like this, even when you see people they are very invested in your lives. They are very invested in your relationship. [On the show last season,] not only [is it] I\u2019m there for the first time ever meeting Scott, they were there too. They saw me meet him too for the first time. They saw our first kiss, so that does make people very tied to us,\" she said. \"And I think it\u2019s so sweet and I\u2019m super flattered by the support of us and of him. He just thought he was going to come on [as my] date ... it\u2019s just very sweet that people are very, very supportive of us.\"", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/summer-house-josh-brown-fave-episode.jpg?itok=qa3P0N9y", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-02/gage-edwards-home-construction-jeff.jpg?itok=gQnzHilg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/285/490/180425_3709580_Tinsley_Mortimer_Gets_a_Special_Surprise.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-todd-kaela-tucker.jpg?itok=EzzwdqqY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/rhonj-season-10-aftershow.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/last-chance-kitchen-playlist-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-02/mercedes-javid-golnesa-gg-baby.jpg?itok=FRVnbv9M", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/05/dish-tinsley-scott.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/08/dish-083017-tinesley-scott.jpg?itok=pIArvblT", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/vanderpump-rules-aftershow-season-8.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-02/rhoa-aftershow-playlist-promo_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/jack-stirrup-kelly-hidge-pregnant.jpg?itok=57tjzieE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/10/127/180621_3748982_Tinsley_Confirms_Her_Break_Up_with_Scott.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/project-runway-season-18-aftershow.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/06/dish-tinsley-mortimer.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/2020-02/rhony-season-12-16x9-no-logo.jpg?itok=RIlhNftn", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072717-tinsley-love-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/06/dish-tinsley-mortimer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/is-real-housewives-of-new-york-citys-tinsley-mortimer-still-dating-scott-kluth", "title": "Tinsley Mortimer Reveals Her Current Status with Scott Kluth", "meta_data": {"title": "Is Tinsley Mortimer Still Dating Scott Kluth?
