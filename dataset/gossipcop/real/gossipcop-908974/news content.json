And Stephen Colbert helped to bridge that gap just a little by asking RuPaul for a vocabulary lesson.\n\nRuPaul Charles stopped by the \u201cLate Show\u201d on Wednesday night to promote the upcoming season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars.\u201d The appearance also served as a reunion between the 69th Emmy Awards host and the living Emmy statue.\n\nAfter sharing some fond memories, Colbert took the opportunity to have the world\u2019s most famous drag queen personally explain some Ru-isms.\n\n\u201cYou said, and I love this, you said, \u2018We\u2019re all naked; the rest is drag,\u2019 \u201d Colbert said. \u201cWhat does that mean? Am I in drag right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, you are, honey,\u201d RuPaul replied. \u201cThis drag is called \u2018executive realness.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe \u201cDrag Race\u201d host then went on to clarify that that \u201cborn naked\u201d quote is commentary on how \u201ceverybody puts on a persona to navigate this world.\u201d Even late-night TV hosts.\n\nBut the lesson didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nNoting how \u201cDrag Race\u201d has \u201cbirthed a language all its own,\u201d Colbert asked RuPaul to translate a few words for him. So RuPaul spilled the tea on \u201ctee,\u201d \u201cokurrr\u201d and \u201csquirrel friends.\u201d\n\nWatch the lesson, and see RuPaul ask Colbert to be his squirrel friend, in the clip above.", "images": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-53613cb8/turbine/la-bio-tracy-brown/400/400x400", "https://www.trbimg.com/img-5a6a1f05/turbine/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-rupaul-gives-stephen-colbert-a-lesson-in-1516897878"], "top_img": "https://www.trbimg.com/img-5a6a1f05/turbine/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-rupaul-gives-stephen-colbert-a-lesson-in-1516897878", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tracy Brown"], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-rupaul-gives-stephen-colbert-a-lesson-in-1516897878-htmlstory.html", "title": "RuPaul gives Stephen Colbert a lesson in 'Drag Race' vocabulary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "x-servername": "i18prod-d90d6c5-15-30.1", "robots": "index,follow", "author": "Tracy Brown", "date": "2018-01-25", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2020 Los Angeles Times", "Description": "There are two types of people in the world: Those who speak \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d and those who don\u2019t.
