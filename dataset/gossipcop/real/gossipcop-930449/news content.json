After the 25-year-old Chicago native was slammed online by fans for his \u201cpoorly timed\u201d remarks, he issued a length apology on the social media platform. \u201cAnyone who knows me knows how passionate I am about my city and my loved ones. Kanye West is not just a mentor or big homie to me. He\u2019s my family. No matter how much I may disagree with him, it\u2019s hard for me to watch people talk about someone I love\u2013even if they were justified in doing so,\u201d Chance wrote. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak up because I agree with what Kanye had to say or cause I f*** with trump, I did it because I wanted to help my friend and cause I felt like I was being used to attack him. Unfortunately, my attempt to support Kanye is being used to discredit my brothers and sisters in the movement and I can\u2019t sit by and let that happen either.\u201d\n\nChance went on to explain that he understands why his fans are upset and that he would never side with someone who\u2019s platform is built on racism, hatred, and discrimination. But as a vocal social activist who\u2019s personally invested $1 million into Chicago Public Schools, he also knows that Democratic leaders in his community haven\u2019t always brought about the sort of change the city needs. \u201cMy statement about black folk not having to be democrats (though true) was a deflection from the real conversation and stemmed from a personal issue with the fact that Chicago has had generations of democratic officials with no investment or regard for black schools, neighborhoods, or black lives. But again, said that sh*t at the wrongest time,\u201d he continued. The \u201cNo Problem\u201d hitmaker also tweeted that he believes the \u201cNext President gon be independent,\u201d instead of Republican or Democrat.\n\nMy fault yo pic.twitter.com/TIWhG8o1ST \u2014 Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) April 27, 2018\n\nChance vowed that he\u2019s going to continue to advocate for social change. \u201cLet my apology be seen in my future works, and let me make up for my poorly timed comments with immediate action and advocacy for those who need it most,\u201d he wrote, before concluding that open, honest discussions about the current political climate need to be taken seriously. \u201cWe have to talk honestly about what is happening and has been happening in this country and we have to challenge those who are responsible, as well as those who are giving them a pass,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that happens to include someone I love, someone who is my brother-in-Christ and someone who I believe does really want to do what is right, it\u2019s not my job to defend or protect him. It\u2019s my job pick up the phone and talk to him about it.\u201d\n\nPrior to his statement, Trump thanked Chance for his support on Twitter. The rapper immediately shut him down, proving that he\u2019s not on his side. \u201cNah that aint it yo,\u201d he replied. Here\u2019s hoping that Chance also called up Kanye and let him know his thoughts, just like how John Legend and T.I. already have.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F27%2Fchance-the-rapper-apologizes-kanye-west-donald-trump-comment-democrat-tweet%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3104099", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/chance-th-rapper-apologizes-for-poor-timing-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/chance-th-rapper-apologizes-for-poor-timing-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/chance-th-rapper-apologizes-for-poor-timing-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/27/chance-the-rapper-apologizes-kanye-west-donald-trump-comment-democrat-tweet/", "title": "Chance The Rapper Apologizes After Fans Slam Him For Defending Kanye West\u2019s Trump Tweets", "meta_data": {"description": "Chance The Rapper apologized for a comment that became misconstrued amid Kanye West's tweets in support of Donald Trump.", "news_keywords": "Chance the Rapper", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Chance The Rapper Apologizes After Fans Slam Him For Defending Kanye West\u2019s Trump Tweets", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/27/chance-the-rapper-apologizes-kanye-west-donald-trump-comment-democrat-tweet/", "description": "After Chance The Rapper was criticized for siding with Kanye West on his controversial pro-Trump tweets, he gave a lengthy apology and clarified his \u2018poorly timed\u2019 comment.", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/chance-th-rapper-apologizes-for-poor-timing-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-27T18:11:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-27T18:11:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Chance The Rapper Apologizes After Fans Slam Him For Defending Kanye West\u2019s Trump Tweets"}, "image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/chance-th-rapper-apologizes-for-poor-timing-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chance The Rapper Apologizes After Fans Slam Him For Defending Kanye West\u2019s Trump Tweets", "description": "Chance The Rapper apologized for a comment that became misconstrued amid Kanye West's tweets in support of Donald Trump."}, "author": "Courteney Larocca", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/27/chance-the-rapper-apologizes-kanye-west-donald-trump-comment-democrat-tweet/?ia_markup=1"}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524758400.0, "source": "https://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
