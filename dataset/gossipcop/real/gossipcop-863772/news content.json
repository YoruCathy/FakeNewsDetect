But as Jimmy Fallon found out on The Tonight Show Tuesday, the commotion over Steve Carell's salt-and-pepper hair has not gone to his head.\n\n\"You're a stud muffin, and I told you I liked your look,\" Fallon told his guest. \"I go, 'Dude, I like your look' backstage and you were very humble. You go, 'Thank you very much. It's just, what? It's gray hair \u2014 big deal.'\"\n\nBut Fallon isn't the only one feeling this way. Photos of the actor's gray mane went viral last week, causing people to stop and pay attention.\n\nEntertainment news outlets also noticed, as Fallon pointed out when showing a handsome photo of the Despicable Me 3 voice actor. \"Bazaar said, 'Nothing will prepare you for these hot photos of Steve Carell. Silver fox alert!' \" Fallon shared, adding, \"HuffPost says, 'Move over, Clooney. Steve Carell is our favorite silver fox now.' \"\n\nSo how has The Office actor's new status changed his life? Carell joked that he now attends silver fox meetings and sports a bracelet confirming he is indeed a \"Hunk of man meat.\" Oh, right, and there's one more bonus. \"My wife finally said she's in love with me,\" he joked. \"I'm very excited.\"\n\nTime to upgrade Michael Scott's \"World's Best Boss\" mug to \"World's Hottest Boss.\"", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6WGPZmuKL_4/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18866fed67b371f2f0603ecb403f16583d1abb7d/c=129-41-788-413/local/-/media/2017/06/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636342352117500048-NUP-178932-0827.JPG?width=659&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18866fed67b371f2f0603ecb403f16583d1abb7d/c=129-41-788-413/local/-/media/2017/06/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636342352117500048-NUP-178932-0827.JPG?width=659&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/06/28/steve-carell-jokes-about-his-new-silver-fox-status-on-the-tonight-show-with-jimmy-fallon/103249552/", "title": "Salt-and-pepper Steve Carell jokes about achieving silver fox status", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Salt-and-pepper Steve Carell jokes about achieving silver fox status", "description": "The actor addressed the sensation over his hair on 'The Tonight Show' Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/06/28/steve-carell-jokes-about-his-new-silver-fox-status-on-the-tonight-show-with-jimmy-fallon/103249552/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18866fed67b371f2f0603ecb403f16583d1abb7d/c=129-41-788-413/local/-/media/2017/06/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636342352117500048-NUP-178932-0827.JPG?width=659&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 659, "height": 372}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The actor addressed the sensation over his hair on 'The Tonight Show' Tuesday.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18866fed67b371f2f0603ecb403f16583d1abb7d/c=129-41-788-413/local/-/media/2017/06/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636342352117500048-NUP-178932-0827.JPG?width=659&height=329&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Salt-and-pepper Steve Carell jokes about achieving silver fox status", "description": "The actor addressed the sensation over his hair on 'The Tonight Show' Tuesday."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498579200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
