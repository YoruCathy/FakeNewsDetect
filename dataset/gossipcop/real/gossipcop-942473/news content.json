He was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.\u201d\n\nA Strasbourg police spokesperson confirmed Bourdain\u2019s death to PEOPLE. Colmar, France, public prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny du Fayel told PEOPLE that Bourdain died by hanging at a luxury hotel in Kaysersberg called Le Chambard, noting \u201cat this stage, nothing suggests the intervention of a third party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cHis love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d\n\nArgento and Bourdain met when the two collaborated on the Rome episode of Parts Unknown in 2016, and Argento became heavily involved in his creative process.

It\u2019s nice to be with somebody who I see as a peer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been in this circus since she was nine,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows so much more about so many of the things that are important to me \u2014 music, books, film, the technical aspects of film, and just the weird state of celebrity, being somebody that people come up to. That\u2019s something she\u2019s dealt with a lot longer than me. I was 44 before that started happening. Whereas, it\u2019s been like that for her since she was a kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis woman likes to work,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe is strong, independent, creative, and needs to have an obsession, needs to make things. I think we\u2019re both relieved by the fact that we both respect each other\u2019s work. Nobody\u2019s ever going to say, \u2018Oh, but you promised we were going to go to the beach.\u2019 No, you get a gig, that\u2019s it. Work first.\u201d\n\nArgento\u2019s most recent photo with Bourdain was posted on May 27.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wrap!\u201d she captioned a black and white photo of the two. \u201c#Firenze @partsunknowncnn @anthonybourdain #makearteveryday.\u201d\n\nBourdain also liked a photo Argento posted to Instagram four days before his death.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fasia-argento-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1997&h=1046&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fasia-argento-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1997&h=1046&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fasia-argento-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/food/asia-argento-cryptic-message-before-anthony-bourdain-suicide/", "title": "Anthony Bourdain: Asia Argento Shared Cryptic Message Before His Apparent Suicide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Anthony Bourdain,Asia Argento,Death,News", "news_keywords": "Anthony Bourdain,Asia Argento,Death,News", "description": "The renowned chef, TV host and author died of apparent suicide at 61", "og": {"title": "Asia Argento Shared Cryptic Message Hours Before Anthony Bourdain's Apparent Suicide: 'F\u2014 Everyone...You Know Who You Are'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/food/asia-argento-cryptic-message-before-anthony-bourdain-suicide/", "description": "In the hours before news broke of Anthony Bourdain\u2018s apparent suicide, his girlfriend Asia Argento was active on social media.
