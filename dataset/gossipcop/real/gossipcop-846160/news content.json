She\u2019s very successful, actually. (She starred on \u201cFriends,\u201d you know.) It must be intimidating to be married to someone who\u2019s accomplished so much in their line of work, right?\n\nNot really.\n\n\u201cNot at all. She's successful for a reason. ... We're not in competition,\u201d \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d star, 45, explained to Esquire for its May issue. \"If I was competing for the same job as her, I might be less forgiving.\"\n\nDoes this look like a man who's intimidated by his wife? Francois Mori / AP\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nThere's definitely no competition between the two of them. In fact, they might collaborate on a project, though Theroux isn\u2019t sharing many details.\n\n\"We were talking about an idea I had that we might start to develop together,\u201d he revealed.\n\nHe\u2019s worked with Aniston before, on the 2012 comedy \u201cWanderlust,\u201d but that was before they were married. What could this new \u201cidea\u201d be? A drama? A comedy? \u201cWanderlust 2\u201d? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nIn the meantime, you can see Theroux and Aniston together at the cashier line of your local supermarket, headlining many magazine covers, not all of them flattering.\n\n\"A friend once told me, 'Another you has been born, this insane person who's constantly breaking up, getting back together, having a baby, losing a baby,'\" Theroux said.\n\nDon't believe everything you read about them. Willy Sanjuan / AP\n\nIn truth, his marriage is going just fine, thank you very much. What\u2019s your secret, Justin?\n\n\"I'm not giving any marriage tips. I am no brighter than any man,\" he told Esquire.\n\nRELATED: Jennifer Aniston likes it when Justin Theroux has a beard \u2014 'up to a point'\n\nNot only is he not intimidated by Aniston, he\u2019s humble, too! No wonder they get along so well.\n\nFollow Shane Lou on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_17/1210405/justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-today-170426-tease_82d40f5a1ade8b3502e25c270b9d2b74.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201704/x_tdy_ov_style_jenniferanistonhair_full_170427.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_17/1210405/justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-today-170426-tease_82d40f5a1ade8b3502e25c270b9d2b74.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/justin-theroux-not-intimidated-jennifer-aniston-s-success-we-re-t110851", "title": "Justin Theroux not intimidated by Jennifer Aniston's success: 'We're not in competition'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/justin-theroux-not-intimidated-jennifer-aniston-s-success-we-re-t110851", "title": "Here's why Justin Theroux is not intimidated by Jennifer Aniston's success", "description": "Intimidated?
