If you ended up in court, it would be a spectacular nightmare.\n\nSpectacular. I see it everywhere. Such animosity and bitterly dedicating years to destroying each other. You'll be in court and it'll be all about affairs and it'll be everything that doesn't matter. It's just awful, it looks awful. One of my favorite movies when it came out was There Will Be Blood, and I couldn't figure out why I loved this movie, I just loved this movie, besides the obvious talent of Paul T. and, you know, Daniel Day. But the next morning I woke up, and I went, Oh, my God, this whole movie is dedicated to this man and his hatred. It's so audacious to make a movie about it, and in life I find it just so sickening. I see it happen to friends\u2014I see where the one spouse literally can't tell their own part in it, and is still competing with the other in some way and wants to destroy them and needs vindication by destruction, and just wasting years on that hatred. I don't want to live that way.\n\nWhat in the past week has given you immense joy? Can you feel that right now?\n\nIt's an elusive thing. It's been a more painful week than normal\u2014just certain things have come up\u2014but I see joy out the window, and I can see the silhouette of palms and an expression on one of my kids' faces, a parting smile, or finding some, you know, moment of bliss with the clay. You know, it's everywhere, it's got to be found. It's the laughter of the African mother in my experience\u2014it's got to come from the blues, to get R&B. That'll be in my book.\n\nThe Everglades | Top, $265, (for t-shirt) by Dries Van Noten / Pants, $1,295, by Giorgio Armani / Bracelet by David Yurman / Watch by Glash\u00fctte Original\n\nAre you going to write a book?\n\nNo! I find writing too arduous.\n\nBut do you worry about the narrative others have written for you?\n\nWhat did Churchill say? History will be kind to me: I know because I'll write it myself. I don't really care about protecting the narrative. That's when I get a bit pessimistic, I get in my oh-it-all-goes-away-anyway kind of thinking. But I know the people who love me know me. And that's enough for me.\n\nDo you remember your dreams?\n\nYeah. A few months ago I was having frightening dreams and I'd consciously lie awake trying to ask, What can I get out of this? What can I learn from this? Those ceased. And now I have been having moments of joy, and you wake and realize it's just a dream, and I get a bit depressed for the moment. Just the moment, just glimpse moments of joy because I know I'm just in the middle of this thing now and I'm not at the beginning of it or at the end of it, just where this chapter is right now, just smack-dab in the middle. It's fucking in the middle of it and, you know, I just don't want to dodge any of it. I just want to stand there, shirt open, and take my hits and see, and see.\n\nThere's obviously incredible grief. This is like a death\u2014\n\nYeah.\n\nThere's a process\u2014\n\nYeah, I think for everyone, for the kids, for me, absolutely.\n\nSo is there an urge to try to\u2014\n\nThe first urge is to cling on.\n\nThen?\n\nAnd then you've got a clich\u00e9: \u201cIf you love someone, set them free.\u201d Now I know what it means, by feeling it. It means to love without ownership. It means expecting nothing in return. But it sounds good written. It sounds good when Sting sings it. It doesn't mean fuck-all to me until, you know\u2014", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/590242de7a2bfa7dce952f48/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Brad-Pitt-GQ-Style-19.jpg",
