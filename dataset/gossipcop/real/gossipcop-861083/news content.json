It is the first time four-year-old North has appeared on the cover of a major magazine.\n\nKardashian, whose family have roots in Armenia, said: \u201cKanye always has his family around and people who look like my daughter \u2014 that\u2019s important to me.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obsessed with her curly hair, and if she finds someone who has the same hair, she runs to them and is like, \u2018You have curly hair like me?\u2019 And we get to talk about it.\n\n\u201cWe also talk about it with my niece Penelope, because she and North look really different, but they\u2019re best friends and they\u2019re together all the time.\u201d\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said the family had \u201cstrict rules\u201d about how much of the children\u2019s lives are included in the reality show that made their name.\n\nShe said: \u201cSome seasons they\u2019re on a little bit, just to show a bit of personality, although there are never storylines about them. But then there\u2019s social media, on which I\u2019ve always been really open. When I\u2019m out and people call North\u2019s name, that\u2019s when it\u2019s weird for me. She lives such a normal life, believe it or not, at home.\u201d\n\nShe shared the images on her Instagram page captioning it: \u201cInterview Magazine September cover!!! This photo shoot I will cherish forever as such an amazing memory with my daughter, working with the most incredible team.\u201d\n\nKardashian-West said the photographs were a \u201chomage to the iconic Jackie Kennedy\u201d.\n\nBut she was criticised on social media, with some people saying the pictures were an insult to the memory of the the former First Lady.\n\nOne person tweeted: \u201cThis is a disgrace, You are no Jackie O,\u201d while another said: \u201cJackie O turning over in her damn grave right now.\u201d\n\nSome twitter users also wanted to know why Kardashian\u2019s skin colour appeared to have been darkened to match that of her daughter.\n\n\u201cWhy did they darken her skin to try and make her look black?\u201d one asked.", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/29/11/kimkardashianlead.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/29/11/kimkardashianlead.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Dex"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-says-she-wants-to-give-north-a-normal-life-as-she-poses-as-jackie-kennedy-for-a3621946.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian says she wants to give North a normal life as she poses as Jackie Kennedy for mother-daughter shoot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-says-she-wants-to-give-north-a-normal-life-as-she-poses-as-jackie-kennedy-for-a3621946.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian says she wants to give North a normal life", "description": "Kim\u00a0Kardashian West said she wants to give her daughter \u201ca normal life\u201d as the pair posed in a new photoshoot inspired by the style of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.", "updated_time": "2017-08-29T11:48:12+01:00", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/29/11/kimkardashianlead.jpg", "site_name": "Evening Standard", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "fb": {"pages": 165348596842143, "app_id": 193840110715213, "admins": 36903991}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/3621946"}, "description": "Kim\u00a0Kardashian West said she wants to give her daughter \u201ca normal life\u201d as the pair posed in a new photoshoot inspired by the style of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.", "keywords": "Kim Kardashian, North West, Celebrity News, Showbiz", "article": {"tag": "Kim Kardashian", "published_time": "2017-08-29T11:48:12+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-29T11:48:12+01:00", "publisher": 165348596842143, "section": "Celebrity News", "author_name": "Robert Dex", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 533, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 7, "external_link_count": 2}, "twitter": {"title": "Kim Kardashian says she wants to give North a normal life", "description": "Kim\u00a0Kardashian West said she wants to give her daughter \u201ca normal life\u201d as the pair posed in a new photoshoot inspired by the style of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@standardnews"}, "google-site-verification": "fI_fn7lv1QlqGWXMIJoqDICBG1ynAC0UDsrriO8e_m8", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Evening Standard"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504003692.0, "source": "https://www.standard.co.uk", "summary": ""}
