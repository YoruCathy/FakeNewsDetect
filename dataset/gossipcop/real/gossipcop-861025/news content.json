That doesn't mean she is going to rag on their new song, though.\n\nWhen asked what she thinks of \"Down,\" Cabello replied,\n\nI've heard some snippets of it. I haven't had a chance to hear the whole thing, but I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nNot to be harsh, but the song, which features Gucci Mane, is three minutes and 14 seconds. I find it suspect that a singer, who inevitably rides in cars to interviews and award shows and hops on planes and maybe even goes to the gym to workout while listening to music, hasn't had three minutes and 14 seconds to listen to the song in its entirety in the past two weeks...\n\nAnyway, Cabello went on to call the song \"a natural evolution,\" saying it's not weird for her that her vocals are missing from the track.\n\nShe also said,\n\nI wish the best for them and I'm sure they're going to kill it, and I'm super happy making my own music.\n\nCabello's first solo album, The Hurting The Healing The Loving, will be released later this year. In the meantime, you can listen to the first two singles from the album, \"Crying in the Club\" and \"I Have Questions.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15353773&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/06/15092018/camila-cabello.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/06/15092018/camila-cabello.jpg?w=1020&h=574&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/elite-daily/2017/06/15091619/fifth-harmony-camila-cabello.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=100478526961130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/elite-daily/2017/06/15091237/fifth-harmony-iheart.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/06/15092018/camila-cabello.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/camila-cabello-leaving-fifth-harmony-happy/1993144", "title": "Why Did Camila Cabello Leave Fifth Harmony?
