I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, I sincerely apologize for my actions,\u201d her tweet continued. \u201cI have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character. I am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Real Housewives' Star Luann De Lesseps Arrested in Florida for Battery\n\nDe Lesseps was arrested in Palm Beach, Fla., on Christmas Eve on charges of battery on an officer, disorderly intoxication, resisting arrest with violence and two corruption by threat charges, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nDe Lesseps rose to fame in 2008 on the Bravo show, which recently wrapped up its ninth season.
