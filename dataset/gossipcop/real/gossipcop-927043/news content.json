And, JB can\u2019t get that smile off his face\u2026\n\nIt looks like Justin Bieber, 24, has moved on from Selena Gomez, 25\u2026 for now, at least. The singer was all smiles while out in Beverly Hills catching a workout class with his rumored new beau, Baskin Champion on April 12. The two apparent lovebirds met up at SoulCycle, where they both rocked baseball caps and causal and grey hooded sweatshirts. It looks like the singer and the model were working on their summer bods, and what better way to do it than with a partner, right? You know what they say \u2014 Couples that work out together, stay together. Check out the photos below!\n\nBieber and Champion\u2019s workout meeting came after she was photographed arriving at his LA home on Wednesday, April 11. And, Champion already knew her way in since she\u2019s been there before. As previously reported, the young model was spotted getting cozy with Bieber when the two attended the same concert back in March 2018. She was later photographed arriving at his house after the show.\n\nMany fans thought the two were just friends after realizing that she is the sister or Bieber\u2019s best friend\u2019s girlfriend. Baskin\u2019s sister, Abby Champion, is in a serious relationship with Patrick Schwarzenegger, 24, who\u2019ve been dating for years. Nonetheless, Bieber continues to spend time with Baskin alone, stirring up those romance rumors.\n\nAs you may know, Bieber and Selena Gomez rekindled their on-and-off, years-long romance back in October 2017, after she split from The Weeknd, 28. The two were going strong until they decided to take a break in March 2017, right around Bieber\u2019s 24th birthday [March 1]. However, that break seems like it\u2019s permanent these days. We\u2019ll have to wait and see!\n\nMeanwhile, Sel has been hard at work on many of her acting projects including her very own franchise, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation, which she stepped out to promote on April 11.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/justin-bieber-baskin-champion-hit-soul-cycle-together-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/justin-bieber-baskin-champion-hit-soul-cycle-together-embed.jpg?w=620&h=350", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F12%2Fjustin-bieber-baskin-champion-work-out-together-photos-soulcycle-relationship%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3079261", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/justin-bieber-baskin-champion-hit-soul-cycle-together-ftr.jpg?w=620", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/justin-bieber-baskin-champion-hit-soul-cycle-together-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/12/justin-bieber-baskin-champion-work-out-together-photos-soulcycle-relationship/", "title": "Justin Bieber & Baskin Champion Hit SoulCycle Looking Cozy As Rumors Swirl He\u2019s Over Selena", "meta_data": {"description": "Justin Bieber and his rumored new flame, Baskin Champion work out together at SoulCycle!
