{"url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/carly-pearce-country-music-women-1202985671/", "text": "On this week\u2019s \u201cCMT Artists of the Year\u201d show, Little Big Town\u2019s Karen Fairchild roused the crowd by using her acceptance speech to run through a list of 35 younger female country artists who are \u201cthere for you to support and play on the radio.\u201d Not every singer on her list has found radio play completely elusive, though. A handful of the singers Fairchild mentioned have had some notable airplay \u2014 with the biggest out-of-the-box solo female success story of the last three years being Carly Pearce, whose first single, \u201cEvery Little Thing,\u201d went to No. 1 in the format in 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s why Pearce was the perfect choice to perform an acoustic set at the end of an panel discussion CMT and Variety jointly hosted about the plight of country\u2019s female acts. Singing three songs and speaking freely about her own rough 10-year road on the way to becoming an overnight sensation, she provided a beam of hope to close out the \u201cBreaking Down The Barrier: A Conversation About Women In Country Music\u201d event, held at Nashville\u2019s Cambria Hotel.\n\nVariety spoke with Pearce to hear more about whether she was really told things were hopeless for her because she was a woman (spoiler: she was) and the more cheerful subject of whether she might already have a sophomore effort on the way (she does).\n\nVARIETY: As Leslie Fram said in introducing you, you\u2019re one of three solo females in the last 12 years to have a debut song top the country radio charts. Yet for a song that bucked the odds like that, \u201cEvery Little Thing\u201d doesn\u2019t check off every obvious box, or have obvious smash written all over it.\n\nPEARCE: If you look at the song that changed my life, it\u2019s a heartbreak ballad with very little production, that was put out in the summer, by a brand new female. So we can\u2019t live by the stereotype that women don\u2019t work. Because I was a walking stereotype (of multiple recipes for failure) \u2014 and I worked.\n\nYou said you had 10 years of sheer frustration before getting signed to Big Machine. That\u2019s sort of hard to fathom when things suddenly go as immediately well as they did for you.\n\nIt was definitely 10 years of feeling like I wasn\u2019t good enough or that I didn\u2019t have music that people thought was relatable or made to be on radio. I went into Leslie Fram\u2019s office (at CMT) and cried so many times. I was so many times feeling defeated just because I was a female before they ever heard my music. I try to be very honest, now that I have some kind of platform in this genre, to let other females know that I was passed on by everyone. And what\u2019s been great for me is to be able \u2014 and I say this very respectfully \u2014 to get out of Nashville and forget all the \u201cmale/female/male/female\u201d (debates) and go play my music and see the girls in the front row sing back every word. Hear the people in the meet-and-greet say, \u201cYour album \u2014 not just your song, but your album \u2014 got me through whatever experience\u201d or \u201cI hope to one day move to Nashville and do what you\u2019re doing.\u201d That\u2019s been very inspiring and healed a lot of wounds that I had of feeling like I wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nWere you ever told explicitly that the rejection had to do with being a woman? Or was it couched in euphemisms?\n\nOh, (it was clear) I was penalized just for being a female, immediately. They didn\u2019t want to take meetings with me if I was a female. They couldn\u2019t get the females on their roster to work. I came into the scene when there were no girls. Kelsea (Ballerini) had not hit yet. Maddie & Tae with \u201cGirl in a Country Song\u201d had not hit. Maren (Morris) had not hit. There was no (CMT) Next Women of Country movement. Leslie hadn\u2019t gotten that going when I first moved here. So it was definitely a lot different and even harder then. So I look at the last 10 years and think we\u2019ve come a long way. And I have a very optimistic outlook on it, because I see, little by little, people like Kelsea and Maren and myself changing the game and being given opportunities. You know, it\u2019s not by chance or by luck that three of the biggest male acts in the format took me as the female artist on tour this year. (Those headliners taking her out as opening act in 2018 were Blake Shelton, Rascal Flatts and, currently, Luke Bryan.) Obviously people want to hear women.\n\nDo you remember any rock-bottom points?\n\nTwo scenarios come to mind. In one, I was actually told by somebody very influential in the industry during a meeting to \u201cmove home.\u201d And I remember making it out to my car just as the door shut before there was guttural crying. And another is, I played \u201cEvery Little Thing\u201d for a lot of people right before it came out, and they told me that it wasn\u2019t special, that my music wasn\u2019t special and I was gonna have to change who I was in order to get a shot. So it\u2019s been beautiful to align myself with a team that believed in the artist that I was and the music that I wanted to make, and I\u2019ve never had to compromise on that. But the fans did this for me. My song went off to Sirius XM with no backing, no nothing, and the fans heard it and they connected to it, and that in itself needs to be shown and really articulated, because that was purely off of people listening to the radio and connecting to the song.\n\nTerrestrial radio took to you, too. Did the subject of women\u2019s difficulties in breaking through come up when you would do those promotional tours?\n\nEach radio person and experience is different. You have some PDs that don\u2019t look at it at all that way; you have some that do. For me, I\u2019ve tried to keep it as much about the authenticity of my music as I can, whatever gender I am. My job in those radio visits is just to convey what my truth is, and they either like it or they don\u2019t. I wish the idea of playing myself and Kelsea back to back wasn\u2019t a no-no or something that gets a slap on the hands. But I do believe that I\u2019ve been heard and respected as an artist just as much as any other artist, female or male, as I\u2019ve introduced myself to country music. And I am really lucky. I travel with all men, my managers are male, my band is male, my radio team is primarily male, and my label head is a male \u2014 and I feel very respected. I feel like a partner as a businessperson, not just as a businesswoman.\n\nThe female artists in country tend to be more individualistic, and it\u2019s not always clear whether that\u2019s for better or worse, commercially.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s very easy to distinguish myself from Kelsea or Maren or Lauren (Alaina), but you look at how many solo male artists there are, and I don\u2019t know that you can really always differentiate them. And there are some pros and cons to that. When Faith and Trisha and Shania were big, if you hit, you were big.\n\nThat seems like such a different time. Those women of the \u201890s were huge without a lot of talk about how they\u2019d smashed through some impossible barrier.\n\nThere were so many, from Reba to Sara Evans and Martina to the Dixie Chicks. And then after that, you have Carrie, Miranda and Taylor (coming along in the mid-2000s). They all meant so much to me. Who are going to be the next superstar females for the little girl \u2014 the mini-Carly Pearce \u2014 that\u2019s figuring out that she wants to do this for a living? Who\u2019s going to be her era of superstars that she\u2019s idolizing? That\u2019s something that we all have to be aware of.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the setbacks, but the women of country seem to have a we\u2019re-all-in-this-together attitude that doesn\u2019t always occur in the competitive world of pop.\n\nAnd Kelsea has been incredible to me, before I ever had a record deal; she liked my music and believed in what I was doing, so she took me under her wing, in the same way that Leslie has taken me and so many other women under her wing at CMT. And I think it\u2019s now my responsibility to continue to carry the torch for whoever that next person that maybe is having some of the hardships that I went through in the last 10 years, and already I want to help pass it, in the way that Kelsea did for me, and the way that Taylor did for Kelsea. I\u2019ve had people coming up behind me \u2014 Kalie Shorr and Runaway June are just two that come to mind \u2014 that go, \u201cYou\u2019re paving the way for us to have a shot.\u201d I take that seriously. That will never leave my brain.\n\nSo, you have a new album in the works?\n\nYeahhhhhh!\n\nHow far along is it?\n\nHmmmm\u2026 I\u2019m about to shock everybody. [Coyly.] I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. I\u2019ve been working really hard. I just celebrated the one-year anniversary of the first album this week. I gave everything that I could into that first record of saying hello to country music, and I think that they know now that I\u2019m here to stay in the genre and my heart beats in country. and I\u2019m excited to show the evolution of my life over the last 15 months.\n\nSo, no predictions about when the first single from the second album will come out?\n\nSoon. My publicists are in here. I got my moms in here; I can\u2019t be letting it out! Very soon. Like, really soon. Like, keep-checking-soon.\n\nIs there anything in particular you\u2019ve changed up for the second album?\n\nAgain, I want to be The Female Country Artist. (As aspirations) I see CMAs, ACMs, Grand Ole Opry member \u2014 that is where my heart is. I have no desire to chase other genres. This is my lane; this is my wheelhouse. I hope to be Dolly Parton one day. So with that, you\u2019re going to hear\u2026 The dobro has become a key part of my sound. And a lot in my life has changed, both professionally and personally. It\u2019s going to be the same girl you know that\u2019s unapologetically herself, but you\u2019re going to hear a bit more of a maturity and just being completely 100% me for the first time. A lot of those songs that I wrote for the first record were in the midst of\u2026 not drowning, but swimming, trying to keep myself afloat. And now I know who I am, and I\u2019ve grown up in the last two years. A lot of those songs [on the first album] were written even four and five years ago. So it\u2019ll be a stronger perspective, but the same country girl. A lot happier girl.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/carlysmile-e1539964612995.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Fcarly-pearce-country-music-women-1202985671%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202985671&comment_count=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/carlysmile-e1539964612995.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Willman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/carly-pearce-country-music-women-1202985671/", "title": "Carly Pearce Does \u2018Every Little Thing\u2019 to Break Barrier Against Women in Country Music", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Country breakout Carly Pearce provided a beam of hope for women in the genre, singing and telling her story at a CMT/Variety summit.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202985671, "author": "Chris Willman", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-10-19T09:29:44"}, "pmc-tag": "carly pearce,cmt artists of the year,Leslie Fram", "title": "Carly Pearce Does \u2018Every Little Thing\u2019 to Break Barrier Against Women in Country Music", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "music", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Carly Pearce Does \u2018Every Little Thing\u2019 to Break Barrier Against Women in Country Music", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/carly-pearce-country-music-women-1202985671/", "description": "On this week\u2019s \u201cCMT Artists of the Year\u201d show, Little Big Town\u2019s Karen Fairchild roused the crowd by using her acceptance speech to run through a list of 35 younger female country artists who are \u201c\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/carlysmile-e1539964612995.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 623, "alt": "NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - OCTOBER 16:  Recording Artist Carly Pearce Performs at True Bar and Music Room on October 16, 2018 in Nashville, Tennessee.
