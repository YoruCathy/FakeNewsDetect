And also gaining the trust and respect of the general public, and using the position for good.\"\n\nRELATED: Prince Harry and Michelle Obama Surprise Chicago High School Students -- Pics!\n\nPrincess Diana, who was known as the \"People's Princess\" and died when Harry was 12, continues to be a major inspiration for the prince.\n\n\"I think she had a lot in common with everybody but also she certainly listened in a very, very short space of time,\" Prince Harry said. \"In society we suffer from this illusion or this reality where some problems get so big that nobody wants to get involved.
