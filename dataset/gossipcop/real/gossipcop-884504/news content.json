It was also the climax of their 40th Anniversary Tour, a 53-show celebration of the singer-guitarist\u2019s unbroken lifetime with his band as one of rock & roll\u2019s biggest, best and most committed live acts.\n\nThirty minutes before he walked onstage, Petty welcomed singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams into his dressing room. \u201cHe had a big smile, and he was putting a cough drop in his mouth,\u201d says Williams, an old friend who had just finished her opening set. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay too long. It was getting close to showtime. I said, \u2018Tom, the audience is rockin\u2019. They\u2019re good to go. I\u2019ve warmed them up for you.\u2019 He looked at me and goes, \u2018I bet you did,\u2019 with those twinkly eyes and that beautiful face.\u201d They hugged; a photo was taken. It was, she says, \u201cthe last time I saw him.\u201d\n\nSix days later, on the evening of October 1st, Petty suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica. He died at 8:40 p.m. the next night, after a daylong vigil by his family, friends and bandmates. Petty was less than three weeks from his 67th birthday.\n\n\u201cI got the phone call and told the folks in my house,\u201d Bruce Springsteen says, recalling the sudden, shocking impact of that news. \u201cThere were shrieks of horror. You couldn\u2019t quite believe it. We were from the same generation of rock & rollers. We started around the same time and had a lot of the same influences. And when I lived in California, I got to know him quite well. He was just a lovely guy who loved rock & roll and came up the hard way.\u201d\n\nOn that last night at the Bowl, in his adopted hometown, the Florida-born Petty covered every mile of his journey with determined, jubilant force: his creative odyssey as a songwriter; the commercial success that continually followed him; the record-business trials that came along with it; his eternal garage-band bond with the Heartbreakers \u2013 lead guitarist Mike Campbell, keyboard player Benmont Tench, bassist Ron Blair, multi-instrumentalist Scott Thurston and drummer Steve Ferrone. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna throw a bunch of records up in the air and see where they fall tonight,\u201d Petty told the sold-out crowd in his sandy, slow-as-molasses drawl, early in a two-hour streak of legacy that was, in fact, decisively chosen and largely set in stone throughout the tour.\n\nThere was the early signature jangle of \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d from the 1976 studio debut, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and the legendary perfectionism of \u201cRefugee\u201d \u2013 more than 100 takes in the studio, Petty claimed \u2013 from his 1979 multiplatinum breakout, Damn the Torpedoes. Much of the show was given to generous spins through the intricate balladry and pointed reflection on Petty\u2019s acclaimed solo outings, 1989\u2019s Full Moon Fever and 1994\u2019s Wildflowers, with profound glow and muscle from the Heartbreakers. And Petty highlighted strong recent work like the heavy-blues rave-up \u201cI Should Have Known It,\u201d from 2010\u2019s Mojo. \u201cHe got the balance he wanted,\u201d Campbell says of the 40th Anniversary shows, \u201cand the story he wanted to tell.\u201d\n\nVery few people beyond the Heartbreakers\u2019 immediate circle knew that Petty was suffering, at each gig, from a hairline fracture in his left hip, which he planned to deal with after the tour. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened,\u201d says his longtime manager Tony Dimitriades. \u201cI don\u2019t think he even knew when it happened.\u201d At one point, Dimitriades told Petty, \u201cYou can\u2019t tour like that.\u201d The singer responded, \u201cWhy not? I\u2019ll do it in a chair if I have to.\u201d\n\nPetty postponed two shows in late August due to laryngitis. He was otherwise in vintage road-warrior form, according to J. Geils Band singer Peter Wolf, who saw the real deal when Petty and the Heartbreakers opened shows for the Geils Band in 1977. This summer, Wolf and his solo group did the honors for Petty. \u201cHe was going through some great pain\u201d from his hip, yet \u201cput on long, stellar shows,\u201d Wolf says. \u201cI\u2019d watch him coming down from the stage. There was an inner force driving him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just kicking ass,\u201d Tench says of Petty, \u201cand we had found another level of playing as a band. There was a depth of soul coming through.\u201d The two men spoke briefly after the September 25th show at the Bowl, raving about it. \u201cI figured I\u2019d get a call in a month or two: \u2018Tom wants to get together and jam some shit out.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt was magical, it was spiritual,\u201d Campbell affirms. \u201cEverybody was so happy, especially Tom \u2013 full of glory and hope.\u201d The guitarist was particularly pleased when Petty threw \u201cBreakdown\u201d \u2013 a nugget from the first album, only played twice before on the tour \u2013 into the closing-night set with striking high harmonies by backing vocalists Charley and Hattie Webb.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so sad,\u201d Campbell says now, \u201cto think that I\u2019m not going to play those songs again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this outpouring since my dad passed,\u201d says Dhani Harrison, a few days after Petty\u2019s death. Dhani \u2013 the son of Petty\u2019s close friend, the late Beatle George Harrison \u2013 notes that when his father died in 2001, \u201csomeone said, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen so many grown men cry.\u2019 The same thing can be applied to this.\u201d\n\nTributes swiftly followed the news of Petty\u2019s passing. On October 3rd, Springsteen dedicated the first preview performance of his solo Broadway residency to Petty. Wilco, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay, Fleet Foxes and the War on Drugs were among the bands that covered Petty\u2019s songs onstage. U2 played bits of \u201cFree Fall-in\u2019 \u201d and \u201cLearning to Fly\u201d during \u201cBeautiful Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought the world of Tom,\u201d said Bob Dylan, who hired Petty and the Heartbreakers as his road band in 1986, then became Petty\u2019s bandmate \u2013 with Harrison, early rock & roll legend Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra \u2013 in a supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys. \u201cHe was a great performer, full of the light, a friend,\u201d Dylan said of Petty, \u201cand I\u2019ll never forget him.\u201d\n\nIn a dramatic acknowledgment of the grieving across America that week for Petty and the victims of the October 1st massacre at a music festival in Las Vegas, country singer Jason Aldean \u2013 who was onstage there when the shooting began \u2013 opened the October 7th episode of Saturday Night Live with \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down,\u201d Petty\u2019s anthem of iron will and moral certainty.\n\n\u201cThat put me off when I wrote it,\u201d Petty said of the song in a 2009 Rolling Stone interview, one of many conversations I had with him over the past decade for the magazine and his SiriusXM channel, Tom Petty Radio. \u201cIt\u2019s so bare, without any ambiguity. There was nothing there but truth.\u201d But, he admitted, \u201cthat was my mindset: I will survive. I will move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom never settled for anything but the best, on any level,\u201d says Campbell, Petty\u2019s musical partner since 1970, when he joined the singer\u2019s early Florida band, Mudcrutch. \u201cThat was one of the great things about him. He didn\u2019t settle for just being OK.\u201d\n\nPetty entered the last year of his life with confidence and pride. In December 2016, during a radio interview to announce the 40th Anniversary Tour, he described a recent rehearsal with the Heartbreakers, their first in two years. \u201cWe had the amps up loud,\u201d Petty told me with a delighted chuckle. They also broke out the blues and covers: \u201cSmokestack Lightning,\u201d \u201cKansas City,\u201d Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cBlack Magic Woman.\u201d \u201cThe band sounds amazing,\u201d Petty exulted. \u201cIt just locked right up.\u201d\n\nThen, on February 10th, 2017, Petty was honored by MusiCares, the musicians health-care charity, as their Person of the Year at a dinner and tribute show. By the time Petty and the Heartbreakers closed with their own set, a broad corps of stars and disciples including Williams, Foo Fighters, Don Henley, Regina Spektor, the Bangles and the modern-rock band Cage the Elephant performed Petty songs from across his entire canon.\n\nRandy Newman opened the evening, playing \u201cRefugee\u201d alone at a piano. \u201cHis hooks, his titles \u2013 when he gets to them, it\u2019s solid as a rock,\u201d Newman says, likening Petty \u201cin a remote, odd way\u201d to the legendary pop songwriter Burt Bacharach, \u201cwho winds all over the place. But when he gets to the hook, slam, it\u2019s there. Petty didn\u2019t wander. But those hooks and titles are so memorable.\u201d\n\nStevie Nicks reprised her duet with Petty, \u201cStop Draggin\u2019 My Heart Around,\u201d a Top Five hit in 1981. The Fleetwood Mac singer attributes his uncanny ability to write for and about women \u2013 the scrappy fighters in that song and 1978\u2019s \u201cListen to Her Heart\u201d; the restless dreamer in \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d; the romantic ideal in \u201cWildflowers\u201d \u2013 to \u201cthe really strong women\u201d around Petty: his first wife, Jane; their two daughters, Adria and AnnaKim; and his second wife, Dana, whom he married in 2001.\n\n\u201cTom was a completely masculine personality,\u201d Nicks says, \u201cbut it softened him and made him much more understanding.\u201d Nicks, who first met Petty in 1978, \u201cwas never afraid to pick up the phone and explain a situation to him. And he would just talk me down.\u201d\n\nAt MusiCares, Cage the Elephant delivered a potent unplugged twist on Petty\u2019s 1993 hit \u201cMary Jane\u2019s Last Dance,\u201d a deceptively jaunty folk-blues about holding on to a fleeting passion. Cage singer Matt Shultz contends that like David Bowie, Petty \u201cconquered the popular belief that creativity dies with age,\u201d especially in rock & roll. \u201cThe more experience he had, the more it enhanced his ability. He became stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one could understand the pace I\u2019m running at,\u201d Petty said in our radio interview. \u201cMy family\u2019s complaining that I don\u2019t take any time off.\u201d Earlier this year, Petty produced an album, Bidin\u2019 My Time, for an idol: Chris Hillman, the singer-bassist in the Byrds and a founding member of the Flying Burrito Brothers. And Petty was keen to work on the next album by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s the Shelters. \u201cIt was a short walk, 20 steps, from his front door to his studio,\u201d Dimitriades says. \u201cHe\u2019d be there every day.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects that had been put on hold when Petty died was an expanded reissue of Wildflowers \u2013 all of the tracks for the intended double album plus additional, unreleased songs \u2013 followed by a tour showcasing Petty\u2019s breakthrough writing on that record. \u201cThat would have been smaller-scale, away from the hits,\u201d Campbell says. But \u201cplans for that somehow evolved into \u2018It\u2019s the 40th year. Let\u2019s do this tour first.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn a 2014 conversation with Rolling Stone, Petty recalled the unique genesis of Wildflowers, pointing to a day when his co-producer, Rick Rubin, played him the Beatles\u2019 demos for their 1968 double LP, The Beatles. \u201cIt hit me how strong the songs were,\u201d Petty said, \u201cwith just a couple of acoustic guitars. I would try to write in the same fashion. I started to hear a whole new kind of thing coming out.\u201d\n\nPetty was flattered when Hillman asked if he could record his own version of Wildflowers\u2018 title track for Bidin\u2019 My Time. \u201cIt is a song of pure love \u2013 agape,\u201d Hillman says, using the ancient Greek word. \u201cThen you look at it now. It\u2019s almost prophecy: \u2018You belong in that home by and by.\u2019 Most of Tom\u2019s stuff \u2013 you could describe it as minimalist. But less is more.\u201d\n\nPetty returned to the Wildflowers project before his 40th Anniversary marathon was over. \u201cHe asked me to call some people,\u201d Dimitriades says, \u201cand see if they would come on the road and perform it with him. One \u2013 and she said yes immediately \u2013 was Norah Jones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to believe it\u2019s even happened,\u201d Dhani Harrison says of Petty\u2019s death. He remembers, as a child, a Christmas in L.A. with the Petty and Harrison families \u2013 Dhani and Adria playing Nintendo with their rock-god dads. And there was the day that an advance copy of Full Moon Fever arrived at Friar Park, the Harrisons\u2019 English estate. George put it on his jukebox, Dhani says, \u201cand just had it on repeat.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Dhani stopped by Petty\u2019s house to play him some new music: Dhani\u2019s first solo album, IN///PARALLEL. \u201cHe put the record on in his studio, put his head in his hands and listened to the whole thing from start to finish,\u201d Dhani recalls. At the end, \u201che looked at me, gave me this big, beaming smile, and said, \u2018Guess you found your target demographic.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was so proud, like a dad,\u201d Dhani says. \u201cI\u2019m sure thinking about that in the future will make me lose it. What could be cooler in the entire world than for your target demographic to be Tom Petty?\u201d\n\nPetty characterized his roots and ambition this way, in the title song of his 1985 album, Southern Accents: \u201cI got my own way of talkin\u2019/But everything gets done, with a Southern accent.\u201d He was born Thomas Earl Petty on October 20th, 1950, in Gainesville, Florida; a brother, Bruce, arrived in 1958. Their mother, Kitty, \u201cwas a very kind, good person,\u201d Tom said in 2009. Their father, Earl, was \u201cJerry Lee Lewis if he didn\u2019t play the piano. He was scary and violent. He beat the living hell out of me.\u201d\n\nIn 1961, an uncle working on the local set of an Elvis Presley movie, Follow That Dream, arranged for Petty and some family members to watch the filming and meet the star. \u201cHe\u2019d met my aunt before,\u201d Petty recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018Elvis, this is my nephew and my niece.\u2019 He said, \u2018Hi, how are you?\u2019 Then he went to his trailer.\u201d In that moment, Petty claimed, Presley \u201cmade my life.\u201d Aside from a few odd jobs in his youth \u2013 in a Gainesville musical-instrument store, as a groundskeeper at the University of Florida, short stints in a barbecue restaurant and a funeral home \u2013 Petty only played, wrote and recorded music for a living, until his death.\n\nAnother epiphany came in 1965 when Petty \u2013 then a member of a local combo called the Sundowners \u2013 went to Jacksonville for his first concert, headlined by the Beach Boys and featuring two British Invasion bands, the Zombies and the Searchers, who became crucial influences on Petty\u2019s lashing-jangle charge and pocket-grenade songwriting with the Heartbreakers. Petty later discovered that Campbell, who grew up in Jacksonville, also went to that show.\n\nThe two finally met in Gainesville, where Campbell was supposed to go to college but instead ended up playing with Petty in Mudcrutch. \u201cWe connected instantly, like we\u2019d known each other already,\u201d the guitarist says. There was also \u201cthis thing that set us apart from the other musicians in town \u2013 this drive to write our own songs.\u201d\n\nBy 1974, the future core of the Heartbreakers \u2013 Petty, Campbell and Tench, another Gainesville native \u2013 had played on Mudcrutch\u2019s debut single, \u201cDepot Street.\u201d Released the next year, it was a commercial bust on Shelter Records that eventually broke up that group. Petty later got a solo deal with Shelter but turned to Campbell and Tench again to form a band \u2013 with Petty\u2019s name up front, playing his songs. \u201cMike and Benmont are good, smart people,\u201d Petty said in 2014. \u201cThey were cool with it right away.\u201d Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \u2013 with Blair and original drummer Stan Lynch, both from Gainesville \u2013 released their self-titled debut album in November 1976, then hit the road in earnest.\n\n\u201cThe influences were obvious \u2013 the Byrds, a lot of the Merseybeat stuff,\u201d Wolf says of Petty and the Heartbreakers\u2019 1977 sets opening for the J. Geils Band. \u201cBut Tom would close the show by doing \u2018Shout.\u2019 It\u2019s a challenging song to do, once you\u2019ve heard the Isley Brothers\u2019 version. I was always amazed how they did it their own way. And every night, they got multiple encores.\u201d\n\nWith Damn the Torpedoes, Petty and the Heartbreakers became that rare phenomenon in rock: a critically acclaimed band that packed arenas, sold albums in platinum numbers \u2013 including the 1985 experimental concept, Southern Accents \u2013 and made challenging singles that were popular on Top 40 radio, FM rock stations and MTV (the eerie menace of \u201cYou Got Lucky\u201d; the electro-psychedelic haze of \u201cDon\u2019t Come Around Here No More\u201d). \u201cTom was a great classicist,\u201d Springsteen says, \u201cand the Heartbreakers were a real guitar band. The music was beautifully written, beautifully constructed. But Tom\u2019s attitude and personality gave it a modern edge.\u201d\n\nTench believes that as a writer, Petty \u201cwalked in this strange penumbra between the shadow and the light.\u201d \u201cFree Fallin\u2019,\u201d Petty\u2019s Top 10 single from Full Moon Fever, \u201chas a catchy chorus,\u201d Tench says. \u201cBut there is a story and sorrow that is brilliantly laid out.\u201d\n\nPetty\u2019s dark side \u2013 manifested at times in an explosive temper; more often channeled into a willingness to wage all-out war with the music business over his integrity and just reward \u2013 was a running parallel drama to his success. He famously fractured his left hand when he punched a wall during a contentious mixing session for Southern Accents. Petty declared bankruptcy while making Damn the Torpedoes to force his way to a more equitable record deal.\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t have a chip on my shoulder,\u201d he told me in 2014. \u201cI was just trying to do the best job I could.\u201d Still, Petty confirmed with relish a story about a meeting to renegotiate a contract during which he pulled a switchblade knife out of his boot and started cleaning his fingernails. \u201cI was just that kind of guy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd those meetings are really boring.\u201d But, he insisted, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have hurt anybody.\u201d\n\nMounting tensions within the Heartbreakers over Petty\u2019s creative grip culminated in Lynch\u2019s departure in 1994. Bass guitarist Howie Epstein, who joined in 1982 when Blair decided to quit the road, was let go in 2002 over his addiction to heroin. (Blair returned; Epstein died of an overdose in 2003.) Petty fell into his own hard-drug use in the Nineties as he coped with a difficult divorce and a rough spell \u2013 musically, commercially, emotionally \u2013 with the Heartbreakers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best period in my life,\u201d Petty confessed in 2006. \u201cBut I am through it. I came out the good side.\u201d\n\nNicks credits Campbell with being a vital, balancing force in Petty\u2019s life. \u201cMichael is such a gentle soul,\u201d she says. \u201cMichael and Tom were able to get through anything because they were the yin and yang of it.\u201d Petty was \u201cin some ways not the easiest person to get along with. Michael was able to be the calming factor.\u201d\n\nPetty, in turn, took the unique nature and benefits of his leadership seriously. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \u2013 it was Tom Petty in the Heartbreakers,\u201d claims Ferrone, an English-born session musician and former member of the Average White Band who played drums on Wildflowers as a sideman prior to becoming a Heartbreaker. Before an encore on Ferrone\u2019s first tour with Petty in 1995, the singer asked him if he knew \u201cBreakdown.\u201d The drummer said no; it wasn\u2019t on the list of songs he was supposed to learn.\n\nFerrone recalls Petty\u2019s response: \u201cTom says, \u2018OK, this is what you do. You play this beat [Ferrone mimics the song\u2019s distinctive shuffle]. The crowd will go crazy. Follow me.\u2019 That was the rehearsal. And here\u2019s the thing: He didn\u2019t have an ego. It wasn\u2019t \u2018You don\u2019t know my most famous song?\u2019 That never came into it.\u201d\n\nPetty \u201cwas so smart,\u201d Campbell says, as well as \u201cone of the funniest people I\u2019ve ever known. And he had a good heart.\u201d The guitarist recalls a point \u201cseveral tours ago\u201d when he was having \u201csome real personal problems. I was doing my job but struggling to keep my vibe up.\u201d One night, in the middle of a song, Petty came over to Campbell, \u201cstood next to me, and he goes, \u2018Just remember, up here, nobody can touch us.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSpringsteen calls it \u201cthe debt\u201d \u2013 the chance, if it comes, to honor a pivotal teacher and repay that gift of inspiration. \u201cYou know that without this guy and without that guy, there would be no you.\u201d\n\nPetty spent much of his stardom in ready, grateful service to his rock & roll elders. In addition to backing Dylan on the road and making two albums with the Traveling Wilburys, Petty produced a 1981 comeback album for the early-Sixties rock & roll singer Del Shannon, Drop Down and Get Me; backed Johnny Cash, with the Heartbreakers, on the country titan\u2019s 1996 album, Unchained; and appeared as a singer and co-writer on a 1991 album by the Byrds\u2019 Roger McGuinn. Petty also found the time to relaunch Mudcrutch \u2013 with original guitarist Tom Leadon and drummer Randall Marsh \u2013 for two studio albums and national touring, the kind of action they never enjoyed the first time around.\n\nThat work produced lasting friendships, especially with Dylan and George Harrison. \u201cI never sought these people out,\u201d Petty claimed when I asked him in 2009 about why he got along so well with legends. \u201cEvery one of them came to me. Obviously, they liked something we did. At times, I think they were looking for some help, like, \u2018I need to put a band together.\u2019 We had this unit. Bob used to say, \u2018These guys communicate without talking.\u2019 He liked that.\u201d\n\nPetty \u201chad a great bullshit detector \u2013 he didn\u2019t suffer fools, just like my dad,\u201d says Dhani Harrison. While Petty and George Harrison \u201cwere kind of stone-y, mellow dudes, they had that toughness. They\u2019d kick your ass. But they loved the same stuff \u2013 ukuleles, motor racing. They would go to the Formula One races together.\u201d\n\nGeorge \u201creally felt at ease with Tom,\u201d Dhani says, \u201cbecause it was like having another you next to you. There were more eyes watching out for you.\u201d\n\nDhani recounts a story that Petty once told him about the Heartbreakers\u2019 tour with Dylan \u2013 a story that \u201csays everything about the way Tom interacted with people: honest but cheeky.\u201d Onstage one night, Dylan kept complaining that the stage lights were too bright and threatened to leave if they were not turned down. Finally, Dylan walked off, forcing Petty to coax him back on as the Heartbreakers kept playing.\n\nIn the wings, Dhani says, \u201cBob was going, \u2018Fucking lights. I\u2019m not going back out there. It\u2019s like fucking Disneyland out there.\u2019 And Tom says to Bob, \u2018You\u2019ve never been to Disneyland.\u2019 Bob just started laughing. Tom called him on it, straight out. They walked back out there and carried on playing.\u201d\n\nWith Petty\u2019s death, three of the five Wilburys are gone (Orbison died in 1988), and the Heartbreakers have lost their voice and leader. But, Tench says, \u201cI never want this guy to be thought of as \u2018OK, we\u2019ve put him in the file, that\u2019s done.\u2019 Because he resonates. There\u2019s a reason why he was in the Wilburys with Bob, Roy and a Beatle. He was a real cat.\u201d When Petty sang \u201ca song by Jimmie Rodgers, Merle Haggard or the Searchers,\u201d Tench insists, \u201che wasn\u2019t a dilettante, trying something on. He was for real.\u201d\n\nThe last time Campbell talked to Petty was after the band\u2019s September 17th concert in San Diego, aboard the flight to Los Angeles ahead of the Hollywood Bowl shows. \u201cTom got up and made a little speech,\u201d the guitarist says, \u201clike, \u2018This has been the best tour. You guys were great. We\u2019re not going to do any more long tours like this, but we have a lot of stuff we\u2019re gonna do, because this is the best the band has ever been.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen he walked past me,\u201d Campbell continues, \u201cI put my arm out, I pulled him close to me and said, \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you. I know your leg has been killing you. You\u2019ve been up there like a soldier, man.\u2019 We had a nice hug and said we loved each other.\u201d After that, at the Bowl, \u201cit was backstage, \u2018Hi, how you doing?,\u2019 a little patter between songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that he\u2019s gone,\u201d Springsteen says of Petty, \u201cbut it was nice to be alive in his lifetime.\u201d And the work remains. \u201cGood songs stay written. Good records stay made. They are always filled with the promise and hope and life essence of their creator.\n\n\u201cTom made a lot of great music,\u201d Springsteen points out, \u201cenough to carry people forward.\u201d\n\nHis hits have defined rock radio since the Seventies, and he never stopped writing great music.

It was also the climax of their 40th Anniversary Tour, a 53-show celebration of the singer-guitarist's unbroken lifetime with his band as one of rock & roll's biggest, best and most committed live acts.\r\n\r\nThirty minutes before he walked onstage, Petty welcomed singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams into his dressing room. \"He had a big smile, and he was putting a cough drop in his mouth,\" says Williams, an old friend who had just finished her opening set. \"I didn't want to stay too long. It was getting close to showtime. I said, 'Tom, the audience is rockin'. They're good to go. I've warmed them up for you.' He looked at me and goes, 'I bet you did,' with those twinkly eyes and that beautiful face.\" They hugged; a photo was taken. It was, she says, \"the last time I saw him.\"\r\nSix days later, on the evening of October 1st, Petty suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica. He died at 8:40 p.m. the next night, after a daylong vigil by his family, friends and bandmates. Petty was less than three weeks from his 67th birthday.\r\n\"I got the phone call and told the folks in my house,\" Bruce Springsteen says, recalling the sudden, shocking impact of that news. \"There were shrieks of horror. You couldn't quite believe it. We were from the same generation of rock & rollers. We started around the same time and had a lot of the same influences. And when I lived in California, I got to know him quite well. He was just a lovely guy who loved rock & roll and came up the hard way.\"\r\nOn that last night at the Bowl, in his adopted hometown, the Florida-born Petty covered every mile of his journey with determined, jubilant force: his creative odyssey as a songwriter; the commercial success that continually followed him; the record-business trials that came along with it; his eternal garage-band bond with the Heartbreakers \u2013 lead guitarist Mike Campbell, keyboard player Benmont Tench, bassist Ron Blair, multi-instrumentalist Scott Thurston and drummer Steve Ferrone. \"We're just gonna throw a bunch of records up in the air and see where they fall tonight,\" Petty told the sold-out crowd in his sandy, slow-as-molasses drawl, early in a two-hour streak of legacy that was, in fact, decisively chosen and largely set in stone throughout the tour.\r\nThere was the early signature jangle of \"American Girl\" from the 1976 studio debut, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and the legendary perfectionism of \"Refugee\" \u2013 more than 100 takes in the studio, Petty claimed \u2013 from his 1979 multiplatinum breakout, Damn the Torpedoes. Much of the show was given to generous spins through the intricate balladry and pointed reflection on Petty's acclaimed solo outings, 1989's Full Moon Fever and 1994's Wildflowers, with profound glow and muscle from the Heartbreakers. And Petty highlighted strong recent work like the heavy-blues rave-up \"I Should Have Known It,\" from 2010's Mojo. \"He got the balance he wanted,\" Campbell says of the 40th Anniversary shows, \"and the story he wanted to tell.\"\r\nVery few people beyond the Heartbreakers' immediate circle knew that Petty was suffering, at each gig, from a hairline fracture in his left hip, which he planned to deal with after the tour. \"I don't know how it happened,\" says his longtime manager Tony Dimitriades. \"I don't think he even knew when it happened.\" At one point, Dimitriades told Petty, \"You can't tour like that.\" The singer responded, \"Why not? I'll do it in a chair if I have to.\"\r\nPetty postponed two shows in late August due to laryngitis. He was otherwise in vintage road-warrior form, according to J. Geils Band singer Peter Wolf, who saw the real deal when Petty and the Heartbreakers opened shows for the Geils Band in 1977. This summer, Wolf and his solo group did the honors for Petty. \"He was going through some great pain\" from his hip, yet \"put on long, stellar shows,\" Wolf says. \"I'd watch him coming down from the stage. There was an inner force driving him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was just kicking ass,\" Tench says of Petty, \"and we had found another level of playing as a band. There was a depth of soul coming through.\" The two men spoke briefly after the September 25th show at the Bowl, raving about it. \"I figured I'd get a call in a month or two: 'Tom wants to get together and jam some shit out.'\u2009\"\r\n\r\n\"It was magical, it was spiritual,\" Campbell affirms. \"Everybody was so happy, especially Tom \u2013 full of glory and hope.\" The guitarist was particularly pleased when Petty threw \"Breakdown\" \u2013 a nugget from the first album, only played twice before on the tour \u2013 into the closing-night set with striking high harmonies by backing vocalists Charley and Hattie Webb.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just so sad,\" Campbell says now, \"to think that I'm not going to play those songs again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't seen this outpouring since my dad passed,\" says Dhani Harrison, a few days after Petty's death. Dhani \u2013 the son of Petty's close friend, the late Beatle George Harrison \u2013 notes that when his father died in 2001, \"someone said, 'I've never seen so many grown men cry.' The same thing can be applied to this.\"\r\n\r\nTributes swiftly followed the news of Petty's passing. On October 3rd, Springsteen dedicated the first preview performance of his solo Broadway residency to Petty. Wilco, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay, Fleet Foxes and the War on Drugs were among the bands that covered Petty's songs onstage. U2 played bits of \"Free Fall-in'\u2009\" and \"Learning to Fly\" during \"Beautiful Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the world of Tom,\" said Bob Dylan, who hired Petty and the Heartbreakers as his road band in 1986, then became Petty's bandmate \u2013 with Harrison, early rock & roll legend Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra \u2013 in a supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys. \"He was a great performer, full of the light, a friend,\" Dylan said of Petty, \"and I'll never forget him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a dramatic acknowledgment of the grieving across America that week for Petty and the victims of the October 1st massacre at a music festival in Las Vegas, country singer Jason Aldean \u2013 who was onstage there when the shooting began \u2013 opened the October 7th episode of Saturday Night Live with \"I Won't Back Down,\" Petty's anthem of iron will and moral certainty.\r\n\r\n\"That put me off when I wrote it,\" Petty said of the song in a 2009 Rolling Stone interview, one of many conversations I had with him over the past decade for the magazine and his SiriusXM channel, Tom Petty Radio. \"It's so bare, without any ambiguity. There was nothing there but truth.\" But, he admitted, \"that was my mindset: I will survive. I will move on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom never settled for anything but the best, on any level,\" says Campbell, Petty's musical partner since 1970, when he joined the singer's early Florida band, Mudcrutch. \"That was one of the great things about him. He didn't settle for just being OK.\"\r\n\r\nPetty entered the last year of his life with confidence and pride. In December 2016, during a radio interview to announce the 40th Anniversary Tour, he described a recent rehearsal with the Heartbreakers, their first in two years. \"We had the amps up loud,\" Petty told me with a delighted chuckle. They also broke out the blues and covers: \"Smokestack Lightning,\" \"Kansas City,\" Fleetwood Mac's \"Black Magic Woman.\" \"The band sounds amazing,\" Petty exulted. \"It just locked right up.\"\r\n\r\nThen, on February 10th, 2017, Petty was honored by MusiCares, the musicians health-care charity, as their Person of the Year at a dinner and tribute show. By the time Petty and the Heartbreakers closed with their own set, a broad corps of stars and disciples including Williams, Foo Fighters, Don Henley, Regina Spektor, the Bangles and the modern-rock band Cage the Elephant performed Petty songs from across his entire canon.\r\n\r\nRandy Newman opened the evening, playing \"Refugee\" alone at a piano. \"His hooks, his titles \u2013 when he gets to them, it's solid as a rock,\" Newman says, likening Petty \"in a remote, odd way\" to the legendary pop songwriter Burt Bacharach, \"who winds all over the place. But when he gets to the hook, slam, it's there. Petty didn't wander. But those hooks and titles are so memorable.\"\r\n\r\nStevie Nicks reprised her duet with Petty, \"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,\" a Top Five hit in 1981. The Fleetwood Mac singer attributes his uncanny ability to write for and about women \u2013 the scrappy fighters in that song and 1978's \"Listen to Her Heart\"; the restless dreamer in \"American Girl\"; the romantic ideal in \"Wildflowers\" \u2013 to \"the really strong women\" around Petty: his first wife, Jane; their two daughters, Adria and AnnaKim; and his second wife, Dana, whom he married in 2001.\r\n\r\n\"Tom was a completely masculine personality,\" Nicks says, \"but it softened him and made him much more understanding.\" Nicks, who first met Petty in 1978, \"was never afraid to pick up the phone and explain a situation to him. And he would just talk me down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt MusiCares, Cage the Elephant delivered a potent unplugged twist on Petty's 1993 hit \"Mary Jane's Last Dance,\" a deceptively jaunty folk-blues about holding on to a fleeting passion. Cage singer Matt Shultz contends that like David Bowie, Petty \"conquered the popular belief that creativity dies with age,\" especially in rock & roll. \"The more experience he had, the more it enhanced his ability. He became stronger.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one could understand the pace I'm running at,\" Petty said in our radio interview. \"My family's complaining that I don't take any time off.\" Earlier this year, Petty produced an album, Bidin' My Time, for an idol: Chris Hillman, the singer-bassist in the Byrds and a founding member of the Flying Burrito Brothers. And Petty was keen to work on the next album by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s the Shelters. \"It was a short walk, 20 steps, from his front door to his studio,\" Dimitriades says. \"He'd be there every day.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the projects that had been put on hold when Petty died was an expanded reissue of Wildflowers \u2013 all of the tracks for the intended double album plus additional, unreleased songs \u2013 followed by a tour showcasing Petty's breakthrough writing on that record. \"That would have been smaller-scale, away from the hits,\" Campbell says. But \"plans for that somehow evolved into 'It's the 40th year. Let's do this tour first.'\u2009\"\r\n\r\nIn a 2014 conversation with Rolling Stone, Petty recalled the unique genesis of Wildflowers, pointing to a day when his co-producer, Rick Rubin, played him the Beatles' demos for their 1968 double LP, The Beatles. \"It hit me how strong the songs were,\" Petty said, \"with just a couple of acoustic guitars. I would try to write in the same fashion. I started to hear a whole new kind of thing coming out.\"\r\n\r\nPetty was flattered when Hillman asked if he could record his own version of Wildflowers' title track for Bidin' My Time. \"It is a song of pure love \u2013 agape,\" Hillman says, using the ancient Greek word. \"Then you look at it now. It's almost prophecy: 'You belong in that home by and by.' Most of Tom's stuff \u2013 you could describe it as minimalist. But less is more.\"\r\n\r\nPetty returned to the Wildflowers project before his 40th Anniversary marathon was over. \"He asked me to call some people,\" Dimitriades says, \"and see if they would come on the road and perform it with him. One \u2013 and she said yes immediately \u2013 was Norah Jones.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's so hard to believe it's even happened,\" Dhani Harrison says of Petty's death. He remembers, as a child, a Christmas in L.A. with the Petty and Harrison families \u2013 Dhani and Adria playing Nintendo with their rock-god dads. And there was the day that an advance copy of Full Moon Fever arrived at Friar Park, the Harrisons' English estate. George put it on his jukebox, Dhani says, \"and just had it on repeat.\"\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Dhani stopped by Petty's house to play him some new music: Dhani's first solo album, IN///PARALLEL. \"He put the record on in his studio, put his head in his hands and listened to the whole thing from start to finish,\" Dhani recalls. At the end, \"he looked at me, gave me this big, beaming smile, and said, 'Guess you found your target demographic.'\r\n\r\n\"He was so proud, like a dad,\" Dhani says. \"I'm sure thinking about that in the future will make me lose it. What could be cooler in the entire world than for your target demographic to be Tom Petty?\"\r\n\r\nPetty characterized his roots and ambition this way, in the title song of his 1985 album, Southern Accents: \"I got my own way of talkin'/But everything gets done, with a Southern accent.\" He was born Thomas Earl Petty on October 20th, 1950, in Gainesville, Florida; a brother, Bruce, arrived in 1958. Their mother, Kitty, \"was a very kind, good person,\" Tom said in 2009. Their father, Earl, was \"Jerry Lee Lewis if he didn't play the piano. He was scary and violent. He beat the living hell out of me.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1961, an uncle working on the local set of an Elvis Presley movie, Follow That Dream, arranged for Petty and some family members to watch the filming and meet the star. \"He'd met my aunt before,\" Petty recalled. \"She said, 'Elvis, this is my nephew and my niece.' He said, 'Hi, how are you?' Then he went to his trailer.\" In that moment, Petty claimed, Presley \"made my life.\" Aside from a few odd jobs in his youth \u2013 in a Gainesville musical-instrument store, as a groundskeeper at the University of Florida, short stints in a barbecue restaurant and a funeral home \u2013 Petty only played, wrote and recorded music for a living, until his death.\r\n\r\nAnother epiphany came in 1965 when Petty \u2013 then a member of a local combo called the Sundowners \u2013 went to Jacksonville for his first concert, headlined by the Beach Boys and featuring two British Invasion bands, the Zombies and the Searchers, who became crucial influences on Petty's lashing-jangle charge and pocket-grenade songwriting with the Heartbreakers. Petty later discovered that Campbell, who grew up in Jacksonville, also went to that show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two finally met in Gainesville, where Campbell was supposed to go to college but instead ended up playing with Petty in Mudcrutch. \"We connected instantly, like we'd known each other already,\" the guitarist says. There was also \"this thing that set us apart from the other musicians in town \u2013 this drive to write our own songs.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1974, the future core of the Heartbreakers \u2013 Petty, Campbell and Tench, another Gainesville native \u2013 had played on Mudcrutch's debut single, \"Depot Street.\" Released the next year, it was a commercial bust on Shelter Records that eventually broke up that group. Petty later got a solo deal with Shelter but turned to Campbell and Tench again to form a band \u2013 with Petty's name up front, playing his songs. \"Mike and Benmont are good, smart people,\" Petty said in 2014. \"They were cool with it right away.\" Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \u2013 with Blair and original drummer Stan Lynch, both from Gainesville \u2013 released their self-titled debut album in November 1976, then hit the road in earnest.\r\n\r\n\"The influences were obvious \u2013 the Byrds, a lot of the Merseybeat stuff,\" Wolf says of Petty and the Heartbreakers' 1977 sets opening for the J. Geils Band. \"But Tom would close the show by doing 'Shout.' It's a challenging song to do, once you've heard the Isley Brothers' version. I was always amazed how they did it their own way. And every night, they got multiple encores.\"\r\n\r\nWith Damn the Torpedoes, Petty and the Heartbreakers became that rare phenomenon in rock: a critically acclaimed band that packed arenas, sold albums in platinum numbers \u2013 including the 1985 experimental concept, Southern Accents \u2013 and made challenging singles that were popular on Top 40 radio, FM rock stations and MTV (the eerie menace of \"You Got Lucky\"; the electro-psychedelic haze of \"Don't Come Around Here No More\"). \"Tom was a great classicist,\" Springsteen says, \"and the Heartbreakers were a real guitar band. The music was beautifully written, beautifully constructed. But Tom's attitude and personality gave it a modern edge.\"\r\n\r\nTench believes that as a writer, Petty \"walked in this strange penumbra between the shadow and the light.\" \"Free Fallin',\" Petty's Top 10 single from Full Moon Fever, \"has a catchy chorus,\" Tench says. \"But there is a story and sorrow that is brilliantly laid out.\"\r\n\r\nPetty's dark side \u2013 manifested at times in an explosive temper; more often channeled into a willingness to wage all-out war with the music business over his integrity and just reward \u2013 was a running parallel drama to his success. He famously fractured his left hand when he punched a wall during a contentious mixing session for Southern Accents. Petty declared bankruptcy while making Damn the Torpedoes to force his way to a more equitable record deal.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly don't have a chip on my shoulder,\" he told me in 2014. \"I was just trying to do the best job I could.\" Still, Petty confirmed with relish a story about a meeting to renegotiate a contract during which he pulled a switchblade knife out of his boot and started cleaning his fingernails. \"I was just that kind of guy,\" he said. \"And those meetings are really boring.\" But, he insisted, \"I wouldn't have hurt anybody.\"\r\n\r\nMounting tensions within the Heartbreakers over Petty's creative grip culminated in Lynch's departure in 1994. Bass guitarist Howie Epstein, who joined in 1982 when Blair decided to quit the road, was let go in 2002 over his addiction to heroin. (Blair returned; Epstein died of an overdose in 2003.) Petty fell into his own hard-drug use in the Nineties as he coped with a difficult divorce and a rough spell \u2013 musically, commercially, emotionally \u2013 with the Heartbreakers. \"It wasn't the best period in my life,\" Petty confessed in 2006. \"But I am through it. I came out the good side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNicks credits Campbell with being a vital, balancing force in Petty's life. \"Michael is such a gentle soul,\" she says. \"Michael and Tom were able to get through anything because they were the yin and yang of it.\" Petty was \"in some ways not the easiest person to get along with. Michael was able to be the calming factor.\"\r\n\r\nPetty, in turn, took the unique nature and benefits of his leadership seriously. \"It really wasn't Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers \u2013 it was Tom Petty in the Heartbreakers,\" claims Ferrone, an English-born session musician and former member of the Average White Band who played drums on Wildflowers as a sideman prior to becoming a Heartbreaker. Before an encore on Ferrone's first tour with Petty in 1995, the singer asked him if he knew \"Breakdown.\" The drummer said no; it wasn't on the list of songs he was supposed to learn.\r\n\r\nFerrone recalls Petty's response: \"Tom says, 'OK, this is what you do. You play this beat [Ferrone mimics the song's distinctive shuffle]. The crowd will go crazy. Follow me.' That was the rehearsal. And here's the thing: He didn't have an ego. It wasn't 'You don't know my most famous song?' That never came into it.\"\r\n\r\nPetty \"was so smart,\" Campbell says, as well as \"one of the funniest people I've ever known. And he had a good heart.\" The guitarist recalls a point \"several tours ago\" when he was having \"some real personal problems. I was doing my job but struggling to keep my vibe up.\" One night, in the middle of a song, Petty came over to Campbell, \"stood next to me, and he goes, 'Just remember, up here, nobody can touch us.'\u2009\"\r\n\r\nSpringsteen calls it \"the debt\" \u2013 the chance, if it comes, to honor a pivotal teacher and repay that gift of inspiration. \"You know that without this guy and without that guy, there would be no you.\"\r\n\r\nPetty spent much of his stardom in ready, grateful service to his rock & roll elders. In addition to backing Dylan on the road and making two albums with the Traveling Wilburys, Petty produced a 1981 comeback album for the early-Sixties rock & roll singer Del Shannon, Drop Down and Get Me; backed Johnny Cash, with the Heartbreakers, on the country titan's 1996 album, Unchained; and appeared as a singer and co-writer on a 1991 album by the Byrds' Roger McGuinn. Petty also found the time to relaunch Mudcrutch \u2013 with original guitarist Tom Leadon and drummer Randall Marsh \u2013 for two studio albums and national touring, the kind of action they never enjoyed the first time around.\r\n\r\nThat work produced lasting friendships, especially with Dylan and George Harrison. \"I never sought these people out,\" Petty claimed when I asked him in 2009 about why he got along so well with legends. \"Every one of them came to me. Obviously, they liked something we did. At times, I think they were looking for some help, like, 'I need to put a band together.' We had this unit. Bob used to say, 'These guys communicate without talking.' He liked that.\"\r\n\r\nPetty \"had a great bullshit detector \u2013 he didn't suffer fools, just like my dad,\" says Dhani Harrison. While Petty and George Harrison \"were kind of stone-y, mellow dudes, they had that toughness. They'd kick your ass. But they loved the same stuff \u2013 ukuleles, motor racing. They would go to the Formula One races together.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge \"really felt at ease with Tom,\" Dhani says, \"because it was like having another you next to you. There were more eyes watching out for you.\"\r\n\r\nDhani recounts a story that Petty once told him about the Heartbreakers' tour with Dylan \u2013 a story that \"says everything about the way Tom interacted with people: honest but cheeky.\" Onstage one night, Dylan kept complaining that the stage lights were too bright and threatened to leave if they were not turned down. Finally, Dylan walked off, forcing Petty to coax him back on as the Heartbreakers kept playing.\r\n\r\nIn the wings, Dhani says, \"Bob was going, 'Fucking lights. I'm not going back out there. It's like fucking Disneyland out there.' And Tom says to Bob, 'You've never been to Disneyland.' Bob just started laughing. Tom called him on it, straight out. They walked back out there and carried on playing.\"\r\n\r\nWith Petty's death, three of the five Wilburys are gone (Orbison died in 1988), and the Heartbreakers have lost their voice and leader. But, Tench says, \"I never want this guy to be thought of as 'OK, we've put him in the file, that's done.' Because he resonates. There's a reason why he was in the Wilburys with Bob, Roy and a Beatle. He was a real cat.\" When Petty sang \"a song by Jimmie Rodgers, Merle Haggard or the Searchers,\" Tench insists, \"he wasn't a dilettante, trying something on.
