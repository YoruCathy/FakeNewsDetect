And though pregnancies are strictly joyous life events for some small-screen families, nothing is that easy for the Pearson family. Chrissy Metz, who plays Kate, says she and Chris Sullivan (Toby) are about to show America something they have never seen before with this baby \u2014 at least on network TV.\n\n\u201cToby and Kate are going to have a bit of an unconventional parenting situation,\u201d Metz told Entertainment Weekly in a recent interview. \u201cNot unconventional in that people aren\u2019t doing it, but not what I think either of them ever had in mind.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us': Everything We Know About Future Randall's 'Her' After 'Kamsahamnida'\n\nToby is struggling with depression, and Metz says this twist to Kate\u2019s pregnancy storyline is going to be a tough one \u2014 not just for Kate on-screen, but for her personally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be challenging for me as an actress, which I\u2019m excited about \u2014 scared but excited,\u201d Metz said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen, at least not on network television.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d showrunner Elizabeth Berger says Kate and Toby will have \u201cvery specific struggles\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not necessarily something that we\u2019ve seen up close before.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Honors Victims of Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting\n\n\u201cBut nothing about Kate and Toby\u2019s journey thus far has been pretty conventional, and it\u2019s going to continue to be something that they have to navigate very carefully,\u201d Berger says. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to share their journey. It\u2019s a really specific one that we\u2019ve been plotting out very carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/This-is-Us-Jack-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/This-Is-Us-Jack.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chrissy-Metz-This-Is-Us-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/This-Is-Us-Jack-Pearson-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sterling-K-Brown-This-Is-Us-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Toby-Kate-This-Is-Us-Season-3.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Toby-Kate-This-Is-Us-Season-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ashley Boucher", "Ross A.
