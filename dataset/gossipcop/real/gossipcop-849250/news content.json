Megan\u2019s huge skeleton is out. As far as we know, that\u2019s her only skeleton. Kyle definitely has a few that are super intense.\"\n\nOn the season finale, Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) was kidnapped and brainwashed by the Institute of the Higher Mind -- or so we thought.\n\nIn the jaw-dropping final moments, Morrison broke the facade she kept up all episode that she had actually bought into IHM's practices and confided in a friend her true intentions: \"I'm gonna burn the whole thing down.\"\n\nE! renewed the drama for a second season, and Henderson told us everything he could about what he knows so far.\n\nSo what can you tell us about these skeletons?\n\nI don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t have any scripts yet. I just know the secret. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to affect everyone in this world. I think there\u2019s a bunch, but I know one. And that\u2019s what keeps it fun \u2013 introducing new things to the audience. At the end of the day, we never want the audience to get comfortable with these characters. We want them always wondering, guessing, figuring things out. So how it\u2019s going to affect Megan and her relationship, how it\u2019s going to affect Kyle\u2019s career, we don\u2019t know yet, and I don\u2019t know yet. These are things that are gonna keep the show a lot of fun. The writers don\u2019t tell us everything for a reason as well. At the end of the day, they want to keep us guessing on our characters. They want to keep us fresh and things changing. But there\u2019s definitely gonna be some bombs dropped on Season 2 for sure.\n\nHow much say do you have in what happens to your character?\n\nWell, actually, I\u2019m playing golf with Jonathan [Abrahams] \u2013 our writer \u2013 next week, and we\u2019re going to talk about storylines for Season 2 and some things that we think would be fun, some things we think would be shocking. Jonathan as a writer is great because he really loves our input. That\u2019s why you saw Kyle West skating this season. That\u2019s why you see Kyle West playing the piano last episode. They include things we like to do. He wanted to know the weird, special skills that I have, secret talents. So those are fun little moments for the audience to go, \u2018Oh, that guy can skate like that? Oh, he can dance? Oh, he can sing?\u2019 There\u2019s things they wouldn\u2019t know unless they include us in to really write into the story and really make things unique. It\u2019s fun. I actually told Jonathan \u2013 so many things happen this season that were like happening in my real life at the same time, so I go, \u2018Jonathan, whatever you do, don\u2019t kill Kyle on the show. Things keep happening to me, and I don\u2019t want to die right now, so keep thinking positive.'\n\nAre you similar to your character in any way?\n\nWe\u2019re both from Middle America. I\u2019m an actor, Kyle\u2019s an actor. They like to write in a lot of Josh Henderson stuff to Kyle West. And Kyle\u2019s a nice guy, he really is. He cares about people, he cares about his career and he cares about the decisions that he makes as an actor. But Kyle\u2019s the biggest film star in the world, and I\u2019m not. He gets to fly on private jets anywhere he wants. I don\u2019t really get to do that. Some of the things that are in his closet definitely aren\u2019t in my closet. Kyle can\u2019t even go to Starbucks. I can go to Starbucks, but I understand how privacy \u2013 once you make it in this business or are very recognizable \u2013 you throw your privacy out the window. I understand that with Kyle.\n\nWhat was your favorite episode of Season 1?\n\nDefinitely Episode 2 because we actually went to Venice, Italy. It was incredible. Shooting there was just like a dream come true. You can\u2019t fake it. I had actually been. I was lucky enough to go to Venice before, but shooting there was a totally different experience.\n\nSo when can we start getting excited about Season 2?", "images": ["https://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/elite-daily-logo-1.png", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/skeleton.svg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rsss-justjared-logo-cut-v2.gif", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/cdl-260x30-for-tmz3-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/19/newsletter-logo-v2-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/05/05/josh-henderson-arrangement-1200x630.jpg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png"], "top_img": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/05/05/josh-henderson-arrangement-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toofab Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://toofab.com/2017/05/05/the-arrangement-josh-henderson-season-finale-season-2-e-scientology/", "title": "'The Arrangement' Star Josh Henderson Teases 'Super Intense' Skeletons in the Closet for Season 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"toofab": 116547240, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@toofab", "title": "'The Arrangement' Star Josh Henderson Teases 'Super Intense' Skeletons in the Closet for Season 2", "description": "\"There\u2019s definitely gonna be some bombs dropped on Season 2,\" Josh Henderson tells TooFab  about \"The Arrangement\" following the Season 1 finale shocker.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/05/05/josh-henderson-arrangement-1200x630.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "keywords": "The Arrangement, Josh Henderson", "description": "\"There\u2019s definitely gonna be some bombs dropped on Season 2,\" Josh Henderson tells TooFab  about \"The Arrangement\" following the Season 1 finale shocker.", "robots": "index,follow", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://toofab.com/2017/05/05/the-arrangement-josh-henderson-season-finale-season-2-e-scientology/", "site_name": "toofab", "type": "article", "title": "'The Arrangement' Star Josh Henderson Teases 'Super Intense' Skeletons in the Closet for Season 2", "description": "\"There\u2019s definitely gonna be some bombs dropped on Season 2,\" Josh Henderson tells TooFab  about \"The Arrangement\" following the Season 1 finale shocker.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/05/05/josh-henderson-arrangement-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116046798441464, "pages": 324392354652}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TooFab"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493913600.0, "source": "http://toofab.com", "summary": ""}
