She spoke last year with senior adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, who also hosted Wednesday's session.\n\nThe White House guest list included Kim Kardashian West; she is married to rap singer and record producer Kanye West.\n\nMark Osler, a University of St. Thomas law professor and an expert on sentencing and clemency who also attended the meeting, called it \u201ca serious, engaged discussion of the clemency process involving people from very different perspectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am encouraged about real work being done to fix something that is broken and important,\u201d he said.\n\nJessica Sloan Jackson, co-founder of the criminal justice reform group Cut 50, said the agenda for the meeting was to work on improving the slow, bureaucratic and opaque system for vetting clemency cases, Jackson said.\n\nKardashian made important contributions to the discussion among the law professors, advocates and White House officials, Jackson said.\n\n\u201cKim is an incredible advocate in this space,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen somebody immerse themselves in an issue the way she has,\u201d she said.\n\nKardashian, the daughter of famed defense attorney Robert Kardashian, championed the case of Alice Marie Johnson, a 62-year-old grandmother whom Trump freed earlier this year. Since then, Jackson said, she\u2019s stayed involved in the issue and has visited prisons to learn more.\n\nIn her tweet, Kardashian said, \"it started with Ms. Alice, but looking at her and seeing the faces and learning the stories of the men and women I\u2019ve met inside prisons I knew I couldn\u2019t stop at just one.\"\n\nAlso attending the meeting: Presidential adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump, whose focus in the White House has been on building job skills.\n\n\u201cI think this is one thing that set today's conversation apart,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in not just granting clemency, but making sure those who are granted clemency succeed when they come home.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Kardashian went to the White House to lobby for a pardon for Alice Marie Johnson; Trump eventually granted clemency to Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who spent more than two decades in prison on drug charges.\n\nMore:'It\u2019s so unfair': Kim Kardashian working to free another convicted felon serving life\n\nTMZ, which first reported Kardashian's latest White House trip, said she is seeking a pardon or clemency for Chris Young, who is serving life in a Tennessee prison for cocaine and marijuana possession.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/05/USAT/3ad0fd87-cbd0-47e8-95a5-1c7265968f31-AP_-Trump-Kardashian.JPG?width=660&height=464&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/17/USAT/3abac42a-a5de-4e8e-b6e5-3c7c2e86d931-COMP_applause_covid_patients_leave_hospital_16x9_Thumbnail_1.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/05/USAT/3ad0fd87-cbd0-47e8-95a5-1c7265968f31-AP_-Trump-Kardashian.JPG?crop=2999,1683,x0,y0&width=2999&height=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/05/USAT/3ad0fd87-cbd0-47e8-95a5-1c7265968f31-AP_-Trump-Kardashian.JPG?crop=2999,1683,x0,y0&width=2999&height=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/05/kim-kardashian-visits-white-house-prison-reform-meeting/1201179002/", "title": "Kim Kardashian visits Donald Trump's White House for prison reform meeting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian visits Donald Trump's White House for prison reform meeting", "description": "Reality television star Kim Kardashian shows up at the White House for a meeting on prison reform.
