Well, for starters, Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) and Olivia (Kerry Washington) will head up a new \u2014 and improved? \u2014 B613. The person who had Frankie Vargas killed was actually his wife, a.k.a. the new vice president Luna Vargas (Tessie Santiago), leading Olivia and Jake (Scott Foley) to force her to kill herself. And Cyrus (Jeff Perry) might not have made the actual call to hire Frankie\u2019s killer, but he\u2019s the one who planted the seeds in Luna\u2019s mind \u2014 and now he\u2019s going to be the vice president.\n\nHere, Bellamy Young, who plays the new president, chats with Variety about the episode\u2019s cliffhangers, Mellie\u2019s new administration, and wrapping up \u201cScandal\u201d with Season 7.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s a little bit of wish fulfillment to have a female president on \u201cScandal\u201d?\n\nWell, I cannot speak for Shonda or the writers\u2019 minds, but I do think it\u2019s important for us, as a country, to be able to have in our living room, get you through the idea of female leadership. We\u2019re way behind the rest of the world in that regard. And definitely in terms of people who will be wonderful presidents, people who have earned it, I think Mellie is in line regardless of her gender. I think it\u2019s all good storytelling.\n\nMellie has always vacillated between being really confident in her abilities and doubting everything. What\u2019s her mindset as she\u2019s going to start her presidency?\n\nI think this last chapter with Peus and Mystery Woman has really burned away any frivolity and really sealed her resolve. [Before their involvement], it was still a dream. She had unrealistic notions about being president. She just knew she wanted to be president, had trained all her life, thought she would be good at it and, of course, had watched Fitz. But whenever you\u2019re not in the driver\u2019s seat, you are not having an authentic experience. I think this new chapter we\u2019re in with Mellie as president, she\u2019s a whole different Mellie. I think a lot of her floating above her power has all gone away. I like to think she\u2019s opened up and rooted down, and we\u2019re really coming from a place of true strength. It\u2019s Mellie, so I know she\u2019ll make a lot of mistakes as well.\n\nHow much do you think Mellie will learn about Luna\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy?\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that she\u2019ll find out to some extent \u2014 not inevitable that she ever finds out that Olivia was at the bottom of it.\n\n\u201cScandal\u201d has always been about who you can and can\u2019t trust. Do you think that\u2019s going to affect how Mellie approaches her new role?\n\nI think life has taught Mellie to be a pragmatist, but Mellie has a romantic heart. That\u2019s where she stumbles. She has a very romantic idea of people, and they so often fail her. It will be really interesting to see, especially since Olivia has been set up to have so much power, both for the good in the White House and for dark with B613. I think it\u2019s going to be very interesting to see Mellie grapple with that and find her true strength, true integrity, true voice in the midst of all that.\n\nHow will Mellie and Cyrus\u2019 dynamic be as president and VP? Will Mellie be okay with Cyrus\u2019 part in the assassination?\n\nI think inasmuch as Mellie is quite na\u00efve to Olivia\u2019s potential for darkness \u2014 she always sees Olivia as the moral barometer, the person you can ask the hard questions and she\u2019ll always give you the honest answer \u2014 she is not at all na\u00efve about who Cyrus is. You cannot trust him even as you\u2019re looking him straight in the face. I think Mellie remains quite awake, on guard, and ready whenever she\u2019s with Cyrus. There\u2019s no greater partner in politics than Cyrus. She knows that he can lift you up to the absolute heavens, but she knows that he\u2019ll tear you down in an instant. It\u2019s making a deal with the devil, which has always been what our show\u2019s been about.\n\nWas it bittersweet when you found out that Season 7 is going to be the final season?\n\nIt was heartbreaking. I wouldn\u2019t even say bittersweet. Bittersweet in that we are so grateful to have another whole year to really bring this story to it\u2019s resting point, to its landing point, because we\u2019re all so interested to see where that is. It really would have killed us to have heard after we wrapped that season six had been our last season. That would have been really devastating. We\u2019re really grateful to have this final year. It wasn\u2019t an unexpected announcement by any measure, but it was still so hard to hear. Kerry was the amazing leader that she always is, and was really the only one of us that could muster eloquence in the moment. Rather than ask anything about \u201cWhere\u2019s it going?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you make this choice?\u201d all we could think to do was love each other and thank Shonda and pledge to be a family forever. It really has been a journey of love.\n\nWhat\u2019s something you would like to see Mellie accomplish in the final season?\n\nI really want to see her lose her self-doubt, come into her powers and her presidency. I think it\u2019s of course important for her, but also important for our nation that she be a great leader. I think she realizes that. That the mission is bigger than her vanity. I\u2019d also love her to get the chance to love and be loved in return. I think that would also heal a piece of her soul that is deeply wounded.\n\nDo you think Season 7 of \u201cScandal\u201d will incorporate any of the headlines coming from real-life Washington D.C. every day?\n\nI don\u2019t have any idea what they\u2019re planning for season seven. We are never a part of those conversations, so I don\u2019t know. All I can say is that I know scenes in season six changed completely, utterly, based on the change in the world after our American election. I have to think, we all live in the real world, and they\u2019re writing in response to the situation at hand. They\u2019re always, of course, taking our wonderful gladiators into consideration. They know what their day is like, and then they sit down and watch TV, and you want to be aware of the opportunity you have with a forum such as this political television show. What comment you\u2019re making, what conversations you\u2019re participating in, what editorial comments you might be making. With that being said, Shonda\u2019s a once-in-a-generation storyteller. She\u2019s always said she knows where these characters are going, and it would take something seismic to alter the essence of someone \u2026 Even if the world has changed how it\u2019s going to [end], I have to trust that Shonda\u2019s always known what is going to happen.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scandal-finale.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fscandal-season-6-finale-bellamy-young-interview-1202435074%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202435074&comment_count=6"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scandal-finale.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jean Bentley"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/scandal-season-6-finale-bellamy-young-interview-1202435074/", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 Finale: New President Dishes on Cliffhangers and \u2018Heartbreaking\u2019 Final Season (SPOILERS)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Bellamy Young talks to Variety about the Season 6 finale of \"Scandal,\" plus why the show is ending after its seventh season.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202435074, "author": "Jean Bentley", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-05-18T20:00:03"}, "pmc-tag": "ABC,Bellamy Young,Scandal", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 Finale: New President Dishes on Cliffhangers and \u2018Heartbreaking\u2019 Final Season (SPOILERS)", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019 Finale: New President Dishes on Cliffhangers and \u2018Heartbreaking\u2019 Final Season (SPOILERS)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/scandal-season-6-finale-bellamy-young-interview-1202435074/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: Do not read ahead if you have not watched the two-hour season finale episode of \u201cScandal,\u201d which aired on Thursday, May 18.
