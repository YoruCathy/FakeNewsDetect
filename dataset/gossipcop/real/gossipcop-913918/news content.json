In a handwritten Instagram post shared on Valentine\u2019s Day, the \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d star explains someone requested that she write a note for a soon-to-be-married couple. \u201cI wrote something congratulatory but then thought \u2018Kristen! Wait! You are an old married woman, shouldn\u2019t you have some wisdom to share?!\u2019\u201d Bell wrote in the caption. She ended up with A-to-Z list of tips on how to maintain a healthy relationship.\n\nA post shared by kristen bell (@kristenanniebell) on Feb 14, 2018 at 12:21pm PST\n\nBell\u2019s top suggestion is to \u201cstay vulnerable with each other,\u201d which she believes promotes intimacy and connection. She also advised that \u201cnecessary separateness\u201d is key to any good relationship, which makes sense especially if you\u2019re both in-demand working actors. \u201cIn 10 yrs, when the dopamine has waned, remember: life is a crazy ride. It\u2019s a privilege to go through it with a partner,\u201d she continued. Bell and Shepard, who share two daughters, Lincoln, 4, and Delta, 2, wed in 2013 after years of dating. They\u2019ve been candid about their struggles as a couple, including their \u201ctoxic\u201d first year together and the therapy they say is the key to marriage.\n\nA post shared by kristen bell
