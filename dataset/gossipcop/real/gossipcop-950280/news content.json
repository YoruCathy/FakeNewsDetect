He added that medical personnel spent six hours trying to revive him, without success.\n\nHe would have turned 87 on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to his hit movies, his recording of \u201cYoung Love\u201d topped the Billboard pop chart in 1957.\n\nBut in his 2005 memoir, \u201cTab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star,\u201d Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man.\n\n\u201cI believed, wholeheartedly \u2013 still do \u2013 that a person\u2019s happiness depends on being true to themselves,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe dilemma, of course, that was being true to myself \u2013 and I\u2019m talking sexually now \u2013 was impossible in 1953.\u201d\n\nBorn Arthur Andrew Kelm, his screen tab (slang for \u201cname\u201d at the time) was fabricated by Henry Willson, the same talent agent who came up with the names Rock Hudson and Rory Calhoun.\n\nThe legend goes that Willson said to the young man: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find something to tab you with. Do you have any hobbies?\u201d His client answered, \u201cI ride horses. Hunters.\u201d Agent: \u201cThat\u2019s it! We\u2019ll call you Tab Hunter.\u201d\n\nWith no dramatic training, Hunter was cast in a minor role in the 1950 drama, \u201cThe Lawless.\u201d The fuss over the young actor began two years later when he appeared bare-chested opposite Linda Darnell in the British-made \u201cIsland of Desire.\u201d Soon his handsome face and muscular build appeared on magazine covers. Warner Bros., alert to the increasingly important youth market, signed him to a contract.\n\nHunter made a flurry of movies in the latter half of the 1950s, aimed at capitalizing on his popularity with young girls. The films included such war dramas as \u201cBattle Cry\u201d (with Van Heflin) and \u201cLafayette Escadrille\u201d (Clint Eastwood in a small role). He made the Westerns \u201cThe Burning Hills\u201d (Natalie Wood) and \u201cThey Came to Cordura\u201d (Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth). And he made romantic comedies like \u201cThe Pleasure of His Company\u201d (Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds.)\n\nA highlight was the 1958 \u201cDamn Yankees!,\u201d an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical with Gwen Verdon and Ray Walston in their Tony-winning New York roles and the original director, George Abbott, sharing direction with Stanley Donen.\n\nBesides the movies, he displayed his athletic skills \u2013 he had been a figure skater as well as horseman \u2013 in a TV special, \u201cHans Brinker, or the Silver Skates.\u201d\n\nAs with so many pop idols, his fans grew up and a new generation sought other favorites. His slide followed the classic pattern: to a television series (\u201cThe Tab Hunter Show,\u201d on NBC, 1960-62); European films (\u201cThe Golden Arrow\u201d) and cheap kid flicks (\u201cRide the Wild Surf.\u201d) In his memoir, he took pains to note that \u201cRide the Wild Surf\u201d was his only beach-party movie; his \u201cOperation Bikini,\u201d despite its title, was \u201cyet another war movie.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he also played small roles in \u201cThe Loved One,\u201d \u201cThe Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\u201d and \u201cGrease 2.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, notably John Waters\u2019 1981 \u201cPolyester\u201d and Paul Bartel\u2019s 1985 \u201cLust in the Dust,\u201d co-produced by Hunter himself.\n\nOf \u201cPolyester,\u201d Hunter wrote: \u201cEverybody got the joke. \u2026 For both John and me, our collaboration paid huge dividends: I\u2019d helped \u2018legitimize\u2019 his brand of movie, and he made me \u2018hip\u2019 overnight.\u201d\n\nHunter appeared on Broadway in 1964 in Tennessee Williams\u2019 \u201cThe Milk Train Doesn\u2019t Stop Here Anymore\u201d opposite the formidable Tallulah Bankhead. The play closed within days, and he said it was \u201ccompletely buried under Tallulah\u2019s offhanded trademark campiness.\u201d\n\nHunter was born in 1931 in New York City, the second son of a mechanic and his German immigrant wife. His father left the family two years later and the boy took his mother\u2019s name, Gelien. Young Arthur Gelien grew up in San Francisco and Long Beach, California, and joined the Coast Guard at 15, lying about his age.\n\nWhile in New York, he saw Broadway plays and became interested in acting. Back in California, Willson arranged for a two-word role in a small Western, \u201cThe Lawless.\u201d He got $500 and a new name.\n\nIn his memoir, he said that his career flourished despite some innuendo and smear articles in the scandal sheets \u2013 \u201cclear evidence that despite its self-righteous claims, \u2018Confidential\u2019 magazine did not influence the taste and opinions of mainstream America.\u201d\n\nWriting the book was difficult, he told The Associated Press in 2005, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a really private person. I grew up full of denial. I just didn\u2019t like any suggestions or questioning of my sexuality.\u201d\n\nIn 1960, Hunter\u2019s boy-next-door reputation did take a hit when he was charged with cruelty for allegedly beating his dog. (He was acquitted). In recent years, Hunter appeared in dinner theaters and organized film projects. After living on a ranch in New Mexico for a time, he took a home in Montecito with his Glaser.\n\nHe didn\u2019t dwell on his Hollywood career or regret losing it. \u201cI had my fling, and I was very fortunate,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut that\u2019s all in my past.\u201d\n\nGeorge Takei, another actor-turned-gay activist, honored him on Twitter Monday, writing, \"Tab Hunter was so much more than a teen heartthrob\u2014he was a celebrated actor, trailblazer, and an icon for the LGBTQ community. Brad and I extend our deepest condolences to his husband, Allan Glaser. RIP, Tab. You will be sorely missed.\"\n\nZachary Quinto, who came out in 2011, noted on Instagram how he had gotten to know Hunter over the last year. \"What a life! Such a rich experience. such a vital and generous nature. and such a pioneer of self-acceptance and moving through this world with authenticity as his guide. he will be missed greatly. may he rest in peace.\"\n\nHarvey Fierstein, who won Tonys for acting in \"Torch Song Trilogy\" and writing \"La Cage aux Folles\" and \"Kinky Boots,\" called Hunter a \"gawjuss gay icon.\"\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e51a0704451f7d10bc603dd5ab1bc6615ffa3c4b/c=0-305-1104-929/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667288109200163-XXX-D03-TAB-HUNTER-BRIEFLY-10.jpg?width=1104&height=624&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16b2f11cdcbcec238582c8b3bdf34ce4cbb144b6/c=25-0-1082-1409/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667288109200163-XXX-D03-TAB-HUNTER-BRIEFLY-10.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e51a0704451f7d10bc603dd5ab1bc6615ffa3c4b/c=0-305-1104-929/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667288109200163-XXX-D03-TAB-HUNTER-BRIEFLY-10.jpg?width=1104&height=624&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/09/tab-hunter-star-damn-yankees-dies-86/767546002/", "title": "Tab Hunter, 1950s movie-star heartthrob, later gay icon, dies at age 86", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Tab Hunter, 1950s movie-star heartthrob, later gay icon, dies at age 86", "description": "The 1950s heartthrob, who starred in \"Damn Yankees\" made headlines again in 2005 when he came out as gay in an autobiography and documentary titled, \"Tab Hunter Confidential.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/09/tab-hunter-star-damn-yankees-dies-86/767546002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e51a0704451f7d10bc603dd5ab1bc6615ffa3c4b/c=0-305-1104-929/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667288109200163-XXX-D03-TAB-HUNTER-BRIEFLY-10.jpg?width=1104&height=624&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1104, "height": 624}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Staff and wire reports", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The 1950s heartthrob, who starred in \"Damn Yankees\" made headlines again in 2005 when he came out as gay in an autobiography and documentary titled, \"Tab Hunter Confidential.\"", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e51a0704451f7d10bc603dd5ab1bc6615ffa3c4b/c=0-305-1104-929/local/-/media/2018/07/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636667288109200163-XXX-D03-TAB-HUNTER-BRIEFLY-10.jpg?width=1104&height=552&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Tab Hunter, 1950s movie-star heartthrob, later gay icon, dies at age 86", "description": "The 1950s heartthrob, who starred in \"Damn Yankees\" made headlines again in 2005 when he came out as gay in an autobiography and documentary titled, \"Tab Hunter Confidential.\""}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531065600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
