The Jewish comedian, actor, and author is best known as the star of award-winning indie abortion comedy Obvious Child. Lately, she\u2019s become a fan favorite for her character work on hit shows like Parks and Recreation, Bob\u2019s Burgers, Hello Ladies, and Kroll Show.\n\nSlate\u2019s brash, no-filter style makes her one of the most memeable\u2013not to mention relatable\u2013celebs out there. Sure, she pals around with famous comedians and has dated super-celebrity Chris Evans, but when push comes to shove, Jenny Slate always keeps it real. Here are 11 times she\u2019s proved that she is all of us:\n\n1. When she accidentally dropped an f-bomb on SNL:\n\n(Image: SNL/NBC)\n\nOk, so most of us will never appear on SNL, but who can\u2019t relate to dropping an f-bomb at an inopportune time? Slate famously cursed on her very first appearance on SNL. She was unceremoniously fired from the show at the season\u2019s end, and has called the experience \u201cembarrassing, devastating, humiliating, a bummer of a mistake.\u201d Years later, she\u2019s finally come out on top. She is the underdog we all see in ourselves.\n\n2. When she thought it was a prank that Chris Evans was into her:\n\n(Image: Comedy Central)\n\nSlate famously dated Hollywood heartthrob Chris Evans after the two filmed the movie Gifted together. She has admitted that originally, she didn\u2019t think she was Captain America\u2019s type: \u201cEventually, when it was like, Oh, you have these feelings for me?, I was looking around like, Is this a prank? I mean, I understand why I think I\u2019m beautiful, but if you\u2019ve had a certain lifestyle and I\u2019m a very, very different type of person \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be an experiment.\u201d\n\n3. And when she got over their breakup by watching You\u2019ve Got Mail on repeat:\n\n(Image: Obvious Child)\n\nSlate said she wept through You\u2019ve Got Mail \u201cso many times it was unbelievable\u201d during her breakup with Evans. She also took comfort in listening to Alanis Morrisette\u2019s infamous breakup album Jagged Little Pill on repeat. Everybody knows nothing heals a broken heart like sobbing it out to your favorite romcoms and screaming \u201cYou Oughta Know\u201d at the top of your lungs. See? All of us!\n\n4. When she had this hilarious reaction to being told she couldn\u2019t order a Bloody Mary before noon:\n\n5. When she refused to grow up:\n\n(Image: Late Night Seth Meyers)\n\n6. When she perfectly explained what modern life is like\n\n7. When she thought her childhood stuffed animals were alive\n\nSlate shared this gem of an anecdote with the NY Times: \u201cWhen I was little I felt that there was something alive in my stuffed animals and in this Madame Alexander doll I slept with every night named Pudding. I slept with 36 stuffed animals and they were in a specific rotation so that each could get a night sleeping next to me. I didn\u2019t want to hurt their feelings.\u201d\n\n8. When she got lonely and begged one of her girlfriends to get drunk with her\n\n(Image: Mae Whitman Instagram)\n\nOne night, Slate was sitting at a bar alone, reading a book about the Holocaust, and she felt a wave of loneliness. She immediately texted one of her BFFs, Mae Whitman (of NBC\u2019s Parenthood): \u201cI was just like, \u2018Can you please help me? I\u2019m so lonely.\u2019 And she came and we got shitbombed, and I woke up the next morning and saw my headphones on my neighbor\u2019s yard. I have no idea how they ended up there.\u201d\n\n9. When she admitted she feels like an imposter adult\n\n(Image: Obvious Child)\n\nIn an essay for Lenny Letter, Slate wrote: \u201cListen, I often walk around feeling that I\u2019m an impostor adult. I make a ton of mistakes, and if my feelings were a person, that person would have messy hair like a bird\u2019s nest (there might even be birds in there), skinned knees, and crumbs in her pockets, but also vibrant powers.\u201d\n\n10: When she unfollowed NASA because space is just too real\n\n(Image: Comedy Central)\n\nWhen Slate made an appearance on Comedy Central\u2019s Drunk History, she shared that she had to unfollow NASA: \u201cI had to unfollow NASA on Instagram \u2018cause it made me too crazy. It would be like, \u2018here\u2019s a picture of a fucking black hole,\u2019 and I was like *SCREAMS*\u201d\n\n11.
