The 25-year-old rapper has fired back at \u201cwannabe promoters\u201d with a countersuit after being sued for cancelling a February 3 Super Bowl LII concert in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a Tuesday, April 17, counterclaim obtained by Us Weekly, Scott claims that Minnesota-based promoters Alex Martini, Jefferson Agar and Patrick Johnston failed to set up travel arrangements for his return to Los Angeles following the performance.\n\nScott\u2019s attorney, Howard King, state that the men \u2014 who run events company PJAM LLC \u2014 breached their contact and owe the entertainer a balance of his fee.\n\nKing called Martini, Agar, Johnston and Johnston \u201cthree wannabe promoters\u201d in a statement to Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cIn an obvious effort to shake Travis down and avoid the consequences of their breaches, they filed a spurious lawsuit while spreading falsehoods in the press,\u201d said King in the statement. \u201cRather than suing, these so-called promoters hold have apologized and taken responsibility for their inability to provide the agreed-upon transportation.\u201d\n\nKing added that Scott \u201capologizes to any fans who were duped by these promoters into showing up at the cancelled show even after the promoters failed to take the steps to get Travis there.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported in March, PJAM claims it paid Scott a $150,000 advance of his $200,00 performance fee for a show at Myth Live Nightclub in Maplewood, Minnesota, one day ahead of the February 4 Super Bowl. In addition, his agent reportedly received a $10,000 booking fee and had arranged for a private jet to fly Scott to the venue.\n\nTMZ reported in March that the \u201cGoosebumps\u201d rapper bailed because his and Kylie Jenner\u2019s daughter Stormi was born on February 1, two days before the scheduled show.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/810861582_travis-scott-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/810861582_travis-scott-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/810861582_travis-scott-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/travis-scott-responds-to-claims-he-bailed-on-show-after-stormis-arrival/", "title": "Travis Scott Responds to Claims He Bailed on Show After Stormi's Arrival", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Travis Scott responded on Tuesday, April 17, to claims he bailed on a Super Bowl LII concert after daughter Stormi\u2019s birth \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Travis Scott Responds to Claims He Bailed on Show After Stormi's Arrival", "description": "Travis Scott responded on Tuesday, April 17, to claims he bailed on a Super Bowl LII concert after daughter Stormi\u2019s birth \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/travis-scott-responds-to-claims-he-bailed-on-show-after-stormis-arrival/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/810861582_travis-scott-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/810861582_travis-scott-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-18T14:58:29+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Travis Scott responded on Tuesday, April 17, to claims he bailed on a Super Bowl LII concert after daughter Stormi\u2019s birth \u2014 get the details", "title": "Travis Scott Responds to Claims He Bailed on Show After Stormi's Arrival", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/810861582_travis-scott-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C41px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524063509.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
