(1:46)\n\nNights don't get much better than the one Carlos Correa had on Wednesday.\n\nFirst, the star Houston shortstop became a World Series champion when the Astros toppled the Dodgers 5-1 in Game 7 in Los Angeles.\n\nThen, while the Astros were celebrating on the Dodger Stadium field, Correa proposed to his girlfriend, who said yes.\n\n\"... I was planning if we were World Series champions, I was going to do it right there,\" Correa said. \"I don't think that's a stage you can create; it just has to happen. And we were able to win tonight, so perfect timing for me to get engaged.\n\n\"I've been thinking about it for months now, but I was waiting for the perfect opportunity, you know. I knew we had a great team, we could accomplish this, and I wasn't wrong.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be bride of Correa is Daniella Rodriguez, the 2016 Miss Texas USA. Correa got down on one knee and, on live television, asked: \"Daniella Rodriguez, will you make me the happiest man in the world? Will you marry me?\"\n\nShe said yes, they kissed and then he presented her with the ring, and they kissed again.\n\nCorrea said he asked for help from one of the clubhouse attendants late in the game.\n\n\"One of the clubbies, I talked to him in the ninth inning, and I'm like, 'I don't want to jinx anything, but if we get the three outs, please bring me the ring because I am going to get engaged in the ballpark.'\"\n\nThe rest was history.\n\n\"It doesn't get any better,\" the 23-year-old Correa said.", "images": ["https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/500/mlb.png&w=80&h=80&transparent=true", "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1101%2Fr283311_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"], "top_img": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1101%2Fr283311_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Buster Olney", "Tim Kurkjian", "David Schoenfield", "Doug Glanville", "Todd Zola"], "canonical_link": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/21258657/2017-world-series-carlos-correa-houston-astros-proposes-victory", "title": "2017 World Series -- Carlos Correa of Houston Astros proposes after victory", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "description": "Carlos Correa went from World Series champion to newly engaged in a matter of minutes Wednesday night, as Houston's star shortstop proposed to his girlfriend on the Dodger Stadium field as the Astros celebrated their Game 7 victory.", "news_keywords": "World Series, Carlos Correa, Houston Astros, MLB", "keywords": "World Series, Carlos Correa, Houston Astros, MLB", "DC.date.issued": "2017-11-02T04:37:10Z", "fb": {"app_id": 116656161708917, "pages": 104266592953439}, "og": {"site_name": "ESPN.com", "url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/21258657/2017-world-series-carlos-correa-houston-astros-proposes-victory", "title": "Yes!
