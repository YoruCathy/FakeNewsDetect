We went back to 2012 and charted the course of their relationship, and the couple has been divided over two big issues for years.\n\n2012 \u2013 The first date\n\nAfter working together for years, John Cena surprised Nikki Bella by asking her out in 2012, months after filing for divorce from his first wife.\n\nVia Cosmopolitan:\n\n\u201cThe first opening line was, \u2018Hey, do you want to go to dinner with me?\u2019 and I was kind of like, \u2018What? With me?'\u201d Bella said. \u201cIt just kind of started out like a dinner date and I have to admit we were friends for so many years, but then when you make it romantic, I couldn\u2019t even say a word to him.\u201d\n\nLate 2013 \u2013 Nikki Bella moves in with John Cena after signing a 75-page agreement\n\nAs was documented on Total Divas, Nikki Bella moved into Cena\u2019s home in Tampa, Florida, but only after she signed a 75-page contract Cena drew up to protect himself.\n\nWe learned more about the contract in an episode of Total Bellas in 2016. Reflecting on his failed first marriage, Cena revealed on the second episode of Total Bellas that Nikki Bella had to sign a 75-page contract before she was able to move in with him.\n\n\u201cHaving been through that process, here is how I view it. It is like buying a handgun for home defense. It gives you a sense of security, and it gives you a failsafe in case something happens. And those who buy a handgun for self defense pray, pray they never have to use it. Without it, it\u2019s a dog fight. I had to have your sister sign an agreement to live in the house. And that\u2019s \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a one-page, it\u2019s a 75-page agreement.\u201d\n\n(We should note here that John Cena and Nikki Bella have put their relationship on display on reality television for years, and it\u2019s up to you whether you want to believe the scenes are genuine or not.)\n\nMay 18th, 2014 \u2013 Nikki Bella reveals her hidden first marriage\n\nNikki Bella married a high school sweetheart at the age of 20, and the couple got divorced when she was 23. She hid the marriage from her entire family, and did not tell Cena. Nikki Bella eventually spilled the beans on an episode of Total Divas.\n\n\u201cWhen the focus of most of our problems has to do with that one subject,\u201d Cena said, \u201cmaybe I should know that stuff.\u201d\n\nSeptember 7th, 2014 \u2013 The Time Bomb: John predicts the future\n\nIn a Total Divas clip that\u2019s almost eerie to watch in 2018, John Cena foresees the future as he and Nikki Bella discuss the prospect of marriage and becoming parents.\n\nCena: \u201cLet\u2019s just say I was to ask you to marry me, and we get married. Would that be enough?\u201d Bella: \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s something you just can\u2019t answer. It\u2019s like saying \u2018hey, do you want to be a mother or not? And answer right now, in two seconds.\u2019 You can\u2019t just say that to a woman.\u201d Cena: \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a realist. I\u2019ve told you that I don\u2019t want to get married and I don\u2019t want to have kids, and you do want to get married and you do want to have kids. So I feel like this is a time-bomb over my head.\u201d Bella: \u201cWell jeez, if you feel like you have a time bomb over your head, are you sure you\u2019re happy?\u201d Cena: \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy, I love you to death. But I don\u2019t know where the line is? I feel like someday you\u2019re just going to wake up and be like \u2018this is not what I want.'\u201d\n\nSeptember 29th, 2015 \u2013 Cena says the thought of having kids gives him \u2018the sweats\u2019\n\nVia EOnline:\n\nIn an exclusive clip from Sunday\u2019s season finale of Total Divas, it\u2019s no surprise he gets extremely anxious when Nikki Bella brings up babies at the dinner table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about how pregnant all my friends are?\u201d she asks him.\n\n\u201cBecause that makes me get the sweats,\u201d he responds. \u201cIt seems like I get a different sonogram photo every week. I don\u2019t know where all these kids are coming from.\u201d\n\nLate 2015/Early 2016 \u2013 Dolph Ziggler offers \u2018marriage, babies\u2019 to Nikki Bella\n\nIn a shocking development, Nikki Bella revealed that WWE star Dolph Ziggler, who dated prior to Bella\u2019s relationship with Cena, wants to marry her.\n\n\u201cDolph pulled me aside at work and told me that he wants to give me marriage and babies. And then he tried to kiss me.\u201d\n\nZiggler had approached Bella back in 2015 to tell her that he still had feelings for her. Prior to WrestleMania 33, The Miz roasted Cena \u2013 who \u201cstole his girlfriend from Dolph Ziggler\u201d \u2013 on an episode of Talking Smack.\n\nApril 21st, 2016 \u2013 Cena confirms he\u2019s still opposed to marriage and to having children in a Rolling Stone profile\n\nRolling Stone profiled Cena just after WrestleMania 32, and he went public with some very strong views on marriage and having kids.\n\nVia Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cJust because everyone else is happy with children doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how I have to live,\u201d Cena said. \u201cI\u2019ve been upfront about this. I just have things I need to get done. It\u2019s not negotiable. We\u2019ve been to therapy over it. I don\u2019t think it will ever be over with. I\u2019m stubborn as [expletive] and extremely selfish as well. I don\u2019t want kids, I don\u2019t want marriage. That\u2019s me just saying, \u2018Hey, this is my life and this is how I\u2019m going to live.\u201d\n\nOctober 5th, 2016 \u2013 The Total Bellas premiere\n\nCena came off as an extremely rigid creature of habit when television cameras entered his home. Here\u2019s a personal favorite moment from the first show, when Cena is explaining the house rules to Daniel Bryan and Brie Bella.\n\n\u201cAfter formal dinner the ladies will retreat to the drawing room together. The men will go to the cigar room. Every morning we will have coffee together. We will have an evening fire outside.\u201d\n\nApril 2nd, 2017 \u2013 The proposal\n\nJohn Cena and Nikki Bella teamed up for a feud with The Miz and Maryse that culminated at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando. After winning a mixed tag match, Cena dropped down to one knee and proposed in the middle of the ring in front of more than 70,000 people.\n\nMarch 29th, 2018 \u2013 Cena says he wishes he popped the question sooner\n\nIn an appearance on NBC\u2019s TODAY, Cena opened up on how he\u2019s changed since the start of his relationship, and said that if he could do it over, he\u2019d ask Nikki Bella to marry him years ago.\n\n\u201cNow when I look at what I had done then as to what I would do now, I just wish I had asked her to marry me then. I guess I wasn\u2019t [ready], but I was ready for her to live in the space I call mine and share everything and do all that\u2026. That didn\u2019t start out like that. I was very abrasive and stern and she had to sign this huge, crazy agreement to come in the front door. So since then I\u2019ve kind of softened.\u201d\n\nApril 6th, 2018 \u2013 Cena talks wedding plans\n\nIn an interview with People, Cena called himself the \u201cfinal checkpoint.\u201d\n\nVia People:\n\n\u201cI want it yesterday, but we have a date\u201d The former Dancing With the Stars contestant, 34, has been taking the lead when it comes to wedding planning. \u201cAll that information rests on her shoulders,\u201d Cena says. \u201cI\u2019m involved in every single step of the process, but I am like the last checkpoint. So, let\u2019s say, d\u00e9cor will be chosen. And then I\u2019ll be given three options but be nudged to like number two. I will politely agree to number two, but I am very much actively a part of the process.\u201d\n\nApril 15th, 2018 \u2013 The breakup\n\nOn a Sunday night, Nikki Bella tweeted out a short statement, announcing that she and Cena had split as a couple and called off their engagement just before their wedding.\n\nWe love you all \u2764\ufe0f N pic.twitter.com/ooACLFXeMv \u2014 Nikki & Brie (@BellaTwins) April 16, 2018\n\nApril 19th, 2018 \u2013 Brie Bella squashes report that Nikki wants to \u201ckill\u201d Cena\n\nBrie Bella, Nikki Bella\u2019s sister, responded to a People.com report on Instagram. In the story, a source claimed that \u201cBrie wants to kill him.\u201d Brie Bella refuted the report, and said that Cena will \u201calways be family.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never say this and I\u2019ll always love John Cena like a brother. He\u2019ll always be family. My heart is hurting for he and my sister.\u201d\n\nMay 6th, 2018 \u2013 Total Bellas teaser shows the moment John and Nikki called it off\n\nIt seems like the breakup was caught on camera and will be aired later in the season.\n\nCena: \u201cI would never force you not to be a mom.\u201d Bella: \u201cI thought I could really sacrifice that, and I just can\u2019t.\u201d Cena: \u201cI\u2019m not sure we should go through with this.\u201d\n\nMay 8th, 2018 \u2013 Nikki Bella thanks fans, reveals she\u2019s moved in with Brie and Daniel Bryan\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just kind of been hiding out, but I wanted to reach out to you all and just thank you all for all your love and support. I can\u2019t tell you how much it\u2019s meant to me, especially through a really difficult time.\u201d\n\nMay 14th, 2018 \u2013 Cena announces he still wants to marry Nikki Bella on TODAY\n\nIn a guest host appearance on NBC\u2019s TODAY Show, Cena made his feelings clear, and said he\u2019s willing to have children.\n\n\u201cFor anyone out there speculating on what I am doing with my life now, I still love Nicole, I still would love to marry Nicole, I still would love to have a family with Nicole. There was an unfortunate set of circumstances where our relationship ended. There has been a lot of speculation recently about me being seen in public and everybody is thinking like, \u2018Oh, John Cena is enjoying the single life.\u2019 No, I was supposed to be married and having honeymoon over these two weeks. \u2026. \u201cSo I\u2019m willing to go back on all of these things that I say, and a lot of them I would hang onto just out of stubbornness. \u2018I won\u2019t have kids,\u2019 and it took a very strong look in the mirror for me to be like, \u2018Why? This is person is my number one and it\u2019s something that\u2019s very valuable to her. Of course we can do this, and I think it would be wonderful.'\u201d\n\nMay 14th \u2013 Nikki Bella says there is \u201chope\u201d for the couple\n\nAfter Cena went public with his intentions, Nikki Bella responded while at at event later in the day.\n\nVia People:\n\n\u201cJohn is such an amazing man. He really is the love of my life. I truly hope one day that we can work it out and get back together,\u201d admitted Bella. \u201cI think there is hope.\u201d\n\nMay 15th, 2018 \u2013 Total Bellas promos document the downfall of the relationship\n\nNikki: \u201cWhat\u2019s hard at times, what people don\u2019t realize about my relationship is I\u2019m alone a lot\u2026 To be honest, since we\u2019ve gotten engaged, John and I have probably shared our bed together maybe 30 days total out of six months? Or 40 days? So hearing Brie and Lauren, J.J. and Bryan all talk about their family stuff and their kids just makes it sink in a little bit more of how lonely it will be and how lonely it gets.\u201d\n\nIn another clip, Brie Bella confronts her sister over making too many sacrifices for Cena.\n\nBrie: \u201cSome times you just tiptoe around John to not make him angry, and I think that\u2019s [expletive].\u201d Nikki: \u201cIsn\u2019t that what wives are supposed to do?\u201d Brie: \u201c[Expletive] no. I tell Bryan exactly how I feel all the time. I don\u2019t hold back, ever.\u201d\n\nMay 16th, 2018 \u2013 Nikki Bella opens up on \u2018sacrifice\u2019\n\nNikki Bella appeared on NBC\u2019s TODAY days after Cena\u2019s confession and explained what contributed to the breakup.\n\nNikki Bella: \u201cI think, a lot of us that go through the wedding planning process, I think we kind of have to face and get forced to face all these issues that we have hiding deep down inside. I just know that a healthy me will be a healthy us. I do have hope for our future, but I know right now I have to work on me. And before I do say those vows and walk down that aisle, I just don\u2019t want to be hesitant. I don\u2019t want to be regretful.\u201d Kathie Lee Gifford: \u201cSo you think you were just getting married too soon before you had those conversations that you needed to have, to have that peace of mind walking forward?\u201d Nikki Bella: \u201cCorrect. I think when you sacrifice for so long, it\u2019s like you can give so much and then you get tired of giving. And then someone wants to give it back and you already feel exhausted.\u201d\n\nMay 17th, 2018 \u2013 Nikki Bella addresses speculation that the breakup is a publicity stunt\n\n\u201cI think sometimes people don\u2019t realize how you could affect them. It\u2019s kind of like when we try to talk to cyberbullies and tell them \u2018you have no idea how you\u2019re affecting people.\u2019 I\u2019m a human being. I\u2019m a human being that literally went through a breakup. Everyone\u2019s been through a breakup, and think of how we feel. Mine has been blown up, and then people all started telling me I\u2019m faking it, so you\u2019re now saying that my heartache is fake and that makes it even harder. It\u2019s just like\u2026 what can I do right?\u201d\n\nMay 30th, 2018 \u2013 Total Bellas reveals that the couple had initially called off the wedding in January\n\nA teaser for an upcoming episode of Total Bellas, showing footage that was shot in January, revealed that Nikki Bella had called off the wedding months before the couple had publicly split, leading to a short separation.
