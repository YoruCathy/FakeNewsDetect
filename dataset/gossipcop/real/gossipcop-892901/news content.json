According to a new report, the 43-year-old actor and his Russian model fianc\u00e9e, 32, are ready to expand their family and have a second baby.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve started trying for another baby,\u201d a source close to the couple \u2014 who are already parents to a one-year-old daughter named Lea De Seine Shayk Cooper \u2014 told Life & Style in the magazine\u2019s latest issue, on newsstands now.\n\n\u201cBradley and Irina are hoping to make Lea a big sister next year,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cThe funny thing is that Bradley\u2019s been staying that he\u2019d be happy with another little girl. He wants Lea to have that special sisterly bond. Irina\u2019s the one who\u2019s desperate for a boy!\u201d\n\n\u201c[They] have begun taking bets [on the gender] from friends and family. Of course, at the end of the day what they both really want is a healthy baby,\u201d the source added.\n\nDuring a recent interview with NPR, Bradley candidly opened up about how becoming a first-time dad has changed his outlook on life and how little Lea has influenced his acting career. \u201cI guess having a kid, and having a family \u2014 which is a miracle and something I have always dreamt of \u2014 has opened me up even more, to the day, and to be present,\u201d he said, according to Celebrity Insider.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cI spent about fifteen years going from movie to movie. And then I hit 39 and stopped and said, \u2018What do I truly want to do?\u2019 I want to tell Joseph Merrick\u2019s story in The Elephant Man. I did that for one year. Then this one came to me, A Star Is Born, and I spent the next four years doing that,\u201d he continued.\n\nIn A Star Is Born \u2014 hitting theaters on Oct. 5! \u2014 Bradley co-stars with Lady Gaga and, while speaking with NPR, the actor said the two hit it off right away. \u201c[We were both] very loved as children. And when I meet people who have had a similar upbringing, I can see it in them. And that is the thing I want my daughter to have \u2014 I always want her to feel loved,\u201d the proud dad said.", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/rachael-harris.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/john-tesh-wife-connie-sellecca03.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Valerie-Bertinelli-Feature.jpg?crop=160px%2C93px%2C1887px%2C1068px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sunny-hostin-abby-huntsman-the-view.jpg?crop=51px%2C67px%2C3168px%2C1795px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/art-carney-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-3.jpg?w=1180&h=478&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/john-stamos-caitlin-mchugh.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-Harry-bothered-by-Prince-William-title.jpg?crop=452px%2C0px%2C3583px%2C3582px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_9241936v.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C5347px%2C3028px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bradley-cooper-family.jpg?w=1180&h=1125&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-William-gets-new-title.jpg?crop=476px%2C0px%2C2875px%2C2875px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10543684k.jpg?crop=518px%2C193px%2C2424px%2C2424px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/martin-lawrence-kids.jpg?crop=741px%2C0px%2C2204px%2C2204px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gene-rayburn-match-game.jpg?crop=0px%2C1597px%2C5235px%2C2963px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_9728195bk.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C4000px%2C2265px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/richard-gere-wife-pregnant.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richard-boone-have-gun-will-travel-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C964px%2C546px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amber-Laign-and-Robin-Roberts.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lucy-podcast-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Birkinbine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-second-baby-166389/", "title": "Bradley Cooper And Irina Shayk Reportedly 'Trying For Another Baby'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Congratulations may soon be in order for Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk!
