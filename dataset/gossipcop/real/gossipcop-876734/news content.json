So much of the focus is on your personal life & has nothing to do with the talent you have to bring to the table,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHaynes, 29, went to to praise American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy, Arrow executive producer Greg Berlanti and Teen Wolf creator Jeff Davis for giving him opportunities. \u201cThank god for Ryan Murphy, Greg Berlanti, & Jeff Davis. They believe gay actors are more than just their personal lives,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSo disappointed in how Hollywood cant understand that playing a character has nothing to do with how u live your personal life.\u201d\n\nThe actor came out as gay in May 2016, and announced his relationship with celebrity floral designer Jeff Leatham in February 2017. The couple got engaged in March in Los Cabos, Mexico.\n\nHaynes has previously said people in the entertainment industry advised him to hide his sexuality. \u201cI\u2019ve been told by so many people that you cannot be out and have a career,\u201d he told The Huffington Post in June. \u201cLiterally, people would set me up with girls for press. \u2026 There was this whole story that ran with Lauren Conrad, who I love \u2014 she\u2019s the best. Basically my old manager at the time was like, \u2018Oh, take a picture with her.\u2019 He just basically ran this story trying to say that I was dating Lauren Conrad. It was there for about six months. I was like, \u2018Oh great, I have to do this.\u2019 That\u2019s how it is in Hollywood. But not anymore. You have all these amazing showrunners who actually embrace people\u2019s personal lives and embrace people\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\nThe Teen Wolf star told Us Weekly last month that he\u2019s so happy with Leatham and that their wedding is happening sometime this year. \u201cEngaged life is amazing,\u201d he told Us. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing in the world. I\u2019m just super happy to have someone so supportive and just loves me unconditionally.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/colton-hayes-84660d29-dcfa-4ec0-ab5e-d1a7c7807da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1012px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/colton-hayes-84660d29-dcfa-4ec0-ab5e-d1a7c7807da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/colton-hayes-84660d29-dcfa-4ec0-ab5e-d1a7c7807da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/colton-haynes-speaks-out-against-homophobia-in-hollywood-w500399/", "title": "Colton Haynes Speaks Out Against \u2018F\u2013ked Up\u2019 Homophobia in Hollywood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Colton Haynes spoke out against Hollywood\u2019s treatment of gay actors in a series of tweets on Tuesday, August 29 \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Colton Haynes Speaks Out Against \u2018F--ked Up\u2019 Homophobia in Hollywood", "description": "Colton Haynes spoke out against Hollywood\u2019s treatment of gay actors in a series of tweets on Tuesday, August 29 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/colton-haynes-speaks-out-against-homophobia-in-hollywood-w500399/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:36:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/colton-hayes-84660d29-dcfa-4ec0-ab5e-d1a7c7807da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/colton-hayes-84660d29-dcfa-4ec0-ab5e-d1a7c7807da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-30T19:20:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:36:30+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Colton Haynes spoke out against Hollywood\u2019s treatment of gay actors in a series of tweets on Tuesday, August 29 \u2014 read more", "title": "Colton Haynes Speaks Out Against \u2018F--ked Up\u2019 Homophobia in Hollywood", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/colton-hayes-84660d29-dcfa-4ec0-ab5e-d1a7c7807da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504120856.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
