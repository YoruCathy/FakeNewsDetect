Avigail has a background in marketing. She's a Brooklynite living in the Bahamas, with a passion for travel, writing, reality TV watching, pop culture and spoken word.\n\nKim Zolciak-Biermann is showing the world that she\u2019s not perfect in a makeup and wig-free selfie.\n\nOn Saturday, The Real Housewives of Atlanta star ditched the foundation and fake hair for a fresh look on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI feel beautiful with no makeup and no wig and I feel beautiful with makeup and a wig,\u201d Zolciak wrote in the photo\u2019s caption. \u201cI love being a woman, dressing up, and I also love running around in my La Perla pajamas bottoms (that are old as sh*t I wear them everyday) and my bathrobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to do what makes YOU happy!\u201d the \u201cTardy for the Party\u201d songstress continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s REALLY important to do YOU! Do what makes YOU happy! Love the skin you\u2019re in!\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to the mom of six, her husband Kroy Biermann, praises her regardless if she\u2019s natural or all dolled up.\n\n\u201cMy husband makes me feel beautiful at all times!\u201d she gushed.\n\nDespite her proud admission to Botox injections, fillers, breast enhancement and tummy tuck procedures, and even cellulite injections, she continues to vehemently deny rumors of facial plastic surgery. And seemingly credits her appearance to her skincare routine.\n\n\u201cI have ALWAYS been into skincare and my skin. I have gone to bed maybe twice in my entire life with makeup on (yes even if I\u2019m swaying at the sink hunni, I still scrub that face).\u201d Adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s REALLY important to do YOU! Do what makes YOU happy! Love the skin you\u2019re in!\u201d\n\nDo you believe this is Kim Zolciak\u2019s bare face or Photoshop sorcery?
