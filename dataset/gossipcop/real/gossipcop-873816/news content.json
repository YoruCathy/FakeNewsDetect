Two couples who broke up on the beach in \u201cParadise\u201d reunited onstage. One couple who left triumphantly, roses in hand, ended their relationship in brutal fashion on Harrison\u2019s couch. Another couple who got engaged during the finale appeared on the reunion show as a glittering, happy pair and even announced a wedding date, but many viewers had already learned of allegations that she had been cheating on her new fianc\u00e9 since the beginning. (By this afternoon, they had broken up.) The final engaged couple remained together \u2015 status quo maintained.\n\nAs \u201cParadise\u201d wound to a conclusion, there were \u2015 as always \u2015 some genuinely touching love stories. They just weren\u2019t the ones that unfolded as expected on the beach.\n\n\u201cBachelor\u201d shows, at their most successful, deliver romances that are almost anti-narrative and yet somehow make them compelling. Imagine a movie, for example, in which a man is dating two women. He cares for them both. They each want an exclusive commitment. Finally, he chooses one of them, and they get engaged and live happily ever after. Even Hallmark wouldn\u2019t air a rom-com with this little narrative tension.\n\nThe reason romantic comedies are so highly watchable is that they follow a familiar arc that still integrates conflict. You know that a couple will face adversity and probably part ways for a time but in the end will find their way back to each other. Thus the narrative is both interesting to watch and the movie equivalent of comfort food. The conclusion is predetermined, but the varied journeys are what keep us coming back for more.\n\nABC Kevin Wendt and Astrid Loch, between boy meets girl and boy loses girl.\n\nAt first, the looser format of \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d allowed for more twists \u2015 surprise engagements, mini breakups and reunions (thanks, Carly and Evan) \u2014 and all the spice you might expect from Nancy Meyers or a New York Times Vows column. But slowly and surely, it has become calcified into an influencer couple factory, with each contestant vying to be the next Jade or Tanner, one half of a lucrative marriage-cum-business.\n\nThe clearer the path to domestic and professional bliss, the more cookie-cutter and camera-ready the relationships seem \u2015 and the more questionable the actual love behind them. When Jordan Kimball and Jenna Cooper got engaged during the finale, it could have been a tear-jerking romantic scene. Instead, it felt a little canned, especially because dogged reporter Reality Steve had just posted texts allegedly from Jenna to another man she was said to be seeing, in which she appeared to swear she didn\u2019t even like Jordan and would make up a story to smear him so she could end the relationship. She needed to be engaged to Jordan, she allegedly told the source, because it would help her business.\n\nThough Kamil Nicalek and Annaliese Puccini didn\u2019t leave \u201cParadise\u201d affianced, they did commit to their relationship in a final rose ceremony. Annaliese, eager for her happy ending, seemed convinced that they were headed to the altar regardless; Kamil expressed doubts in confessional tapings but played along with the love story \u2015 right up until he sat down next to a glowing Annaliese on the reunion show, whipped out a shiv and stabbed her in the heart (metaphorically). Their soft-focus declaration of love quickly gave way to grimy reality: a sleazy dude humiliating his girlfriend by dumping her in the most public way possible.\n\nThe \u201cBachelor\u201d audience is cued to respond most favorably to couples who follow that aforementioned franchise-approved path to love \u2015 dating, opening up, falling in love, getting engaged (all on camera, of course) and then cruising into coupled Instagram fame. But the final rose exchanges on Tuesday night brought no tears to our eyes, though the still extant engagement between Chris Randone and Krystal Nielsen was sweet and perhaps even sincere. Through no fault of theirs, the most compelling love stories of \u201cParadise\u201d were those that took a more winding, interesting and \u2014 dare we say \u2014 real road to get there.\n\nBefore the season\u2019s last rose ceremony, fan favorites Joe Amabile and Kendall Long heartwrenchingly parted ways after he expressed that he was completely in love with her and she couldn\u2019t fully reciprocate in the moment. Kendall was left sobbing on the beach while Joe took himself out of paradise. Less than a day later, Kevin Wendt and Astrid Loch broke up on the beach during a tear-filled conversation during which he said that something in the relationship just \u201cwasn\u2019t sitting right\u201d but he couldn\u2019t quite articulate what that missing thing might be.\n\nThese two couples were the longest-standing ones of the season, and their breakups made even the most jaded in the \u201cBachelor\u201d audience feel something more than curiosity about what the couples\u2019 first sponsored ad might be. (Diff Eyewear? Sugar Bear Hair? Shit-Your-Brains-Out-to-Get-Thin Tea? The possibilities are endless.) Their breakups, in the universe of the show, were failures of love, commitment and romance.\n\nIn the end, Kevin and Astrid and Joe and Kendall found their way back to each other, mostly off camera. Producers captured a short, inconclusive conversation between Joe and Kendall in Chicago, but it was clear that the bulk of the work of getting back to a place where they could be in a committed relationship was done over dinners and phone calls and during visits to their respective hometowns \u2015 you know, the way actual people in the actual world decide to commit their time and affection to each other. But this gap in filming didn\u2019t diminish the emotional returns.\n\nInstead, it offered us an accidental rom-com. Two couples divided by circumstance and misunderstanding; four hearts broken and yearning. Their separations were perfectly paced to set up a final-act grand gesture, a sentimental reunion. When Kevin, on the couch with Chris Harrison, professed that he still loved Astrid, she hesitated slightly before admitted she loved him too. On our couches, we wept as if we were rewatching \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d\n\nJoe even detailed his reconciliation with Kendall with generous use of dramatic suspense, drawing out his description of their visits together in Chicago and LA before dropping the bomb: He still loved her, and they were officially back together. He offered a \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d\u2013style list of what he loved about her \u2015 how she\u2019s a know-it-all, how he can wind her up. The couple snuggled and kissed, love triumphant again. Our hearts twanged in our chests like banjos. Roll credits.\n\nABC can\u2019t offer this to us every time. That\u2019s why \u201cBachelor\u201d shows are so tightly produced and the relationships subjected to such intense pressure: There\u2019s no guarantee that an on-camera breakup will result in a teary, amorous on-camera reunion two months later. The producers\u2019 best shot at capturing love onscreen is to insist that couples make it work on the beach. If they want to deliver each season, they can\u2019t allow the very hints of reality and doubt that make relationships compelling to watch.\n\nFor more on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d listen to \u201cHere to Make Friends\u201d:\n\nDo people love \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d or do they love to hate these shows? It\u2019s unclear. But at \u201cHere to Make Friends,\u201d we both love and love to hate them \u2014 and we love to snarkily dissect each episode in vivid detail.
