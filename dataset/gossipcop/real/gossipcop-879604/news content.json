As Donald Trump is voted into office, her old phobias rear their ugly heads once again, but in the second episode of the season, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark,\u201d it only gets much, much worse. In fact, her fears become fatal in the last shot of the episode, one of the most unsettling scenes yet.\n\nBut first, we pick up where we left off \u2014 with Ally in bed with one of the dreaded clowns. She screams and runs for Ivy (Alison Pill), who rushes to protect her and is as sweet and patient as ever. When she finds no such clown in the bedroom, however, despite Ally\u2019s protests, Ivy admits again that Ally\u2019s anxiety has taken its toll on her. Ally finally resigns to her state, saying, \u201cI think there might be something wrong with me.\u201d (But hey: Just because she\u2019s paranoid, it doesn\u2019t mean someone isn\u2019t out to get her.)\n\nMeanwhile, we see that Kai\u2019s (Evan Peters) nefarious plans from the last episode have been working out swimmingly for him. After he provoked a band of construction workers by yelling racial slurs at them and chucking over a condom full of his urine, they unleashed a beatdown on him\u2026 while someone filmed on a cell phone nearby. Now it\u2019s a local news story, and of course it takes a political turn: some of the construction workers have been taken into the custody of ICE. In announcing his run for city council \u2014 a seat that was vacated by the murder of councilman Chang \u2014 he quotes Trump\u2019s \u201crapists and criminals\u201d line, yelling, \u201cLook at my face, Michigan!\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the Changs, the Mayfair-Richards already have new neighbors. After a rather creepy scene where Winter (Billie Lourd) engages in the most serious pinky swear ever with Oz, vowing to take his fear for him, she allows him to go next door to play with the new residents. Ally and Ivy get home and immediately freak out over this (how have they not fired Winter yet? Seriously?) and rush over to find Oz playing with bees. Yes, in a blatant reference to the \u201chive mind\u201d theme of this season, one of the new neighbors is actually a beekeeper.\n\nAnd this also means that Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman\u2019s characters have been revealed. Harrison and Meadow are married, but not a couple \u2014 in fact, Harrison is gay. They just got married based on a pact they made when they were younger. Harrison gets one night a week to go out on the town and satisfy his needs, while Meadow, because of her past case of skin cancer, doesn\u2019t like to be touched, so it all works out pretty nicely for them. They\u2019re a blunt pair, which takes Ivy and Ally aback, but Harrison notes that that\u2019s just \u201cthe way of the world now.\u201d Indeed, Harrison.\n\nAlly \u2014 surprise! \u2014 is skeptical of them, especially of the mysterious barrels they keep at their home, and the fact that they moved into the Chang\u2019s old house so soon after the murders. But she\u2019ll soon learn that they\u2019re the least of her worries. Something\u2019s tripped the alarm system back at their restaurant, and though Ivy offers to go, Ally insists that she can and that she\u2019s \u201cgot this.\u201d One has the sense, however, that she does not, in fact, got this. When she gets there, she makes a gruesome discovery: one of her restaurant\u2019s managers hanging from a meat hook, just barely alive. As we learn later, Ally had to be the one to kill him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there\u2019s an investigation, but there\u2019s a political twist now: a worker at the restaurant is a suspect, due to an argument with the deceased that turned weirdly racial at the top of the episode. When a police officer, played by \u201cAHS\u201d newcomer Colton Haynes, asks Ally and Ivy about his immigration status, Ivy indignantly insists that \u201che\u2019s American.\u201d Other repercussions of the murder, of course, lie in Ally\u2019s psyche. She gets a gun from Harrison, who has a troubling stockpile of them as he started to collect them, in a sense, when Barack Obama became president. Harrison goads on Ally\u2019s fears, telling her, it\u2019s \u201cthe only thing that will make you feel safe again.\u201d\n\nIvy, concerned, invites Ally\u2019s therapist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson) for a home call. Here, Ally tells him that she feels \u201cvindicated\u201d by her phobias and that they keep her safe, which\u2026 is one way to go. \u201cThe world is f\u2014ed up,\u201d she tells him. \u201cThe election made it worse.\u201d She shows him her new gun, and while he\u2019s worried, he\u2019s unable to tell Ivy because of doctor-patient confidentiality, Ally notes.\n\nLater, after Ally\u2019s fortified her house, she gets an unwelcome visit from Kai, who she best knows currently as the man who dumped coffee all over her and Ivy in the last episode. He\u2019s making a visit to campaign for office, and in a chilling scene, we see right rhetoric v. left rhetoric in full form. Ally, ironically from behind her newly installed bars, tells Kai that she\u2019s interested in \u201cbuilding bridges, not walls.\u201d Kai asks if he can get a drink of water, and Ally refuses to let him in and threatens to call the cops. Crazed, Kai yells, \u201cIt\u2019s so easy until it\u2019s you they\u2019re coming for!\u201d\n\nThis does not help Ally\u2019s mental status. Later, as Ivy\u2019s gone at the restaurant, Ally stares reluctantly at her pills. Winter picks up on this \u2014 she encourages Ally to have some wine and a bath to unwind, instead of taking her medication. Winter goes so far as to draw a bath for her, and when Ally\u2019s relaxing, she reappears. While Ally is surprised at first, Winter starts to help wash her off. It\u2019s clearly a seduction technique, and it\u2019s kind of genius: she knows Ally\u2019s stressed, and therefore relaxes her into seduction. But nothing ruins the mood like crazed clown murderers.\n\nSuddenly, the power goes out, and with it, so does Winter, exclaiming that she has to go home to save her laptop. Harrison appears at her window to yell one of the best lines of the episode: \u201cLesbians! We\u2019re under attack!\u201d It\u2019s interesting that he goes political, telling Ally that it could be Russians or \u201cthose crazy freaks in North Korea,\u201d seemingly playing on her fears. Ally panics and calls Ivy, who\u2019s dealing with the power outage at the restaurant too. When Ally\u2019s phone dies, Ivy sends Pedro \u2014 the employee currently under investigation for murder \u2014 with some supplies for her.\n\nMeanwhile, Ally\u2019s lost it. She finds that someone\u2019s cut the cords in her fusebox, and even sees a few of the masked murderers. When she runs upstairs to grab Oz, she has to throw one off of from the top of the stairs (and though it could mean nothing, it\u2019s worth noting: there\u2019s no thump to be heard when the assailant hits the ground). With her gun in hand, she rushes Oz to the door and instructs him to run to the neighbors\u2019 house. When she opens the door, however, someone\u2019s standing there, and in her panic, she shoots him. But lo and behold, it was Pedro there to help her \u2014 and now, he could very well be dead.\n\nNow, not only has Ally committed a murder and lost another friend, but my guess is Kai will try to use this to his advantage. Maybe his fear-mongering is working \u2014 on Ally, at least.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/american-horror-story-cult1.jpg?w=942", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Famerican-horror-story-recap-season-7-episode-2-dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-ahs-cult-1202552659%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202552659&comment_count=8"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/american-horror-story-cult1.jpg?w=942", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Stedman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/american-horror-story-recap-season-7-episode-2-dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-ahs-cult-1202552659/", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Recap: Meet the New Neighbors in \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "This week's \"American Horror Story: Cult\" begins with the consequences of the premiere, and ends with a truly chilling development.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202552659, "author": "Alex Stedman", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-09-12T20:00:47"}, "pmc-tag": "American Horror Story,American Horror Story: Cult", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Recap: Meet the New Neighbors in \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Recap: Meet the New Neighbors in \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/american-horror-story-recap-season-7-episode-2-dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-ahs-cult-1202552659/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you\u2019ve seen Season 7, episode 2 of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d titled \u201cDon\u2019t Be Afraid of the Dark,\u201d which aired on Sept. 12.
