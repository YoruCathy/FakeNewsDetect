Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images)\n\nEver since announcing her engagement to Prince Harry, the world's eyes have been fixed on Meghan Markle \u2014 and her style. We'll be following the Meghan Markle Effect\u2122 with our column, \"Meghan Markle Wore a Thing.\"\n\nFollowing this week's news that Meghan Markle had covertly been baptized in the Church of England, the soon-to-be American royal headed out with Prince Harry for a more public engagement, celebrating International Women's Day. On Thursday, the couple hit the road to the English city of Birmingham to visit an event hosted by the Stemmettes, a local social enterprise organization which encourages young women to pursue careers in STEM fields, science, technology, engineering and math (or \"maths,\" as they call it over there).\n\nFor the occasion, Markle followed up on her recent Jason Wu wrap dress with a slew of additional American brands and designers. The look was headlined by a navy wool J.Crew topcoat \u2014 very Michelle Obama of her, no? \u2014 complete with tipped white hems and a belt (which, as we all know, obviously, she loves). Unsurprisingly, the piece is already sold-out on JCrew.com. Sorry!\n\nPhoto: Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nShe paired it with above-the-ankle Alexander Wang cigarette trousers, a plush AllSaints sweater, Altuzarra's \"Ghianda\" saddle bag and her go-to Manolo Blahnik pointy-toed pumps.\n\nMarkle has long been a vocal and dedicated advocate for gender equality and women's rights, maintaining a role as an \"Advocate for Political Participation and Leadership\" with UN Women since 2014. Very good clothing aside, the real excitement here revolves around the passionate feminism she'll be bringing into Buckingham Palace.\n\nSee more things The Duchess of Sussex has worn in the gallery below:\n\n25 Gallery 25 Images\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter and get the latest industry news in your inbox every day.", "images": ["https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU5MDkxMjcxOTU5MzI0NDQw/meghan-markle-princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-dress-outfit-th.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTUzNTA0MjMwMzI0MzE1MzM0/meghan-th.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTU0MDM2NzYyNTE0MDQwNTcx/meghan-markle-th.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTYyMjQ2ODc3NTc4Nzk4NzUw/meghan-markle-jcrew-jacket-morocco.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_406%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU2Mzg0MjUyMzIwMDMyMDMx/meghan-markle-oldr-dress.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_406%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTUxNjk0OTYwMDUwMDU0MzI4/meghan-markle-prince-harry-engagement.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU4NTgzMjAzNjM0ODgxODky/meghan-markle-wore-blue-smythe-coat-new-th-2.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1280/MTQ3MzQzMTc3NTg0NDg2MzU3/fashionista-hub-thebusines-1.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTQ5OTY2NzI5ODE1NjA3/mtqwndi3ntcznze1oda1njgw-1.svg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTU0MDM2NzY5MjI0OTI2OTcx/gettyimages-929152688.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTU0MDM2Nzg1NTk5NDg5MTA2/gettyimages-929153188.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/assets/MTM0MTYyNjUxNDg2OTMwOTU0/site-nav-logo.svg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_60/MTMzMjYyMTMyMTM2NDE3NzU4/unnamedjpg.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_406%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU2MzA3OTM0MjQwODQzMDU1/meghan-markle-wore-givenchy-bespoke-dress-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTU0MDM2NzYyNTE0MDQwNTcx/meghan-markle-th.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Brannigan"], "canonical_link": "https://fashionista.com/2018/03/meghan-markle-wore-j-crew-coat-alexander-wang-pants", "title": "Meghan Markle Wore a Thing: J.Crew Coat Edition", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "TUkwvpzHc7_80yJEnb9HCoPrp2jYlkLlZrEIu53H66o", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest - www.saymedia.com", "pinterest": "nohover", "author": "Maura Brannigan", "description": "Sorry, it already sold out!", "keywords": "Meghan Markle Wore A Thing,J.Crew,Network,Manolo Blahnik,Alexander Wang,Style,Altuzarra,Meghan Markle,AllSaints", "section": "Style", "pagetype": "article", "item-id": "ci02233f0d30002452", "published": "2018-03-08T13:46:08Z", "modified": "2018-06-21T20:36:41Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "Breaking Media, Inc.
