Chatting with his friend Sarah Jessica Parker for V Magazine, the crooner admitted that he's struggled with body issues in the past. (We feel you, Sam!)\n\nWhen Parker asked her friend about self-image, Smith confessed that he's more comfortable in front of a camera now than he used to be. But, he was in a particularly rough spot when he was shooting his first music videos.\n\n\"I just wasn\u2019t happy with the way I looked, so I was trying to control the way the camera moved,\" Smith said. \"I got a bit obsessive. I was constantly looking in the mirror, pinching my waist, weighing myself every day.\"\n\nSmith has also been open about his diet in the past, admitting that he changed up his eating habits to achieve a slimmer physique over the course of several years. These days, Smith said in V: \"I\u2019ve gotten to a place where I really love my stretch marks and I just enjoy my body.\"\n\nStill, the singer knows that body issues don't just disappear overnight. \"My body image is always going to be an issue,\" he confessed. \"I need to constantly train myself to watch the right sort of films, to not look at certain ads and think that\u2019s how my stomach should look. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m fighting every day. I think men should talk about it more.\"\n\nWe love Smith for his candor. And, for the record (no pun intended), we think he looks perfect as is.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-02/bravoleb-reunion-looks.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-01/bravoleb-home-tours.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/lookbook-sam-smith-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/mike-shouhed-haircut.jpg?itok=bzMrkjzh", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/lookbook-amanda-kyle-engaged-promote.jpg?itok=X_TG6yAi", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/lookbook-paris-hilton-engaged-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-04/rhobh-interview-looks-season-10.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/bravo-coronavirus-quarantine-check-in.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/bravoleb-diet-playlist.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/charli-burnett-modeling.jpg?itok=1mltcyzC", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/147/479/171206_3631078_Sam_Smith___s_Naughty_Housewives_Tagline.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kenya-moore-rhoa-reunion-drama.jpg?itok=bgjJlU7e", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/lookbook-madonna-daughter-armpit-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/08/dish-180417-sam-smith-promote.jpg?itok=ZPMyM322", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/paige-desorbo-rich-sweatpants.jpg?itok=gtblaenY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/lookbook-sam-smith-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/lookbook/sam-smith-talks-stretch-marks-body-issues", "title": "Sam Smith Opens Up About His Body Image Issues: \"Men Should Talk About It More\"", "meta_data": {"title": "Sam Smith Talks About Weight Struggles, Body Image Issues | Style & Living", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "In his heartfelt songs, Sam Smith bears his soul.
