By early afternoon, an uproar had broken out on two fronts.\n\nFirst, her hushed, banjo-driven take on EWF\u2019s most popular song (head here for an excellent history of the original version) received such a torrent of less-than-enthusiastic attention on social media that Hollywood Life published a story with the headline \u201cTwitter Needs to Seriously Chill About Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018September\u2019 Cover.\u201d Swift\u2019s version is calmer and dramatically different from EWF\u2019s euphoric original.\n\nAt around the same time, according to reports, the press release announcing the songs was revised to eliminate the second two sentences in this paragraph: \u201cTaylor says that she chose \u2018September\u2019 for sentimental reasons. She\u2019s always loved the classic tune by Earth, Wind & Fire, and notes that the month of September is especially meaningful to one of her relationships. An added layer of sentiment came from being able to record the song in a Nashville studio, the city Taylor moved at age 14 to pursue country music.\u201d Spin has done some speculative analysis on the edit, as well as Swift\u2019s alteration of the date in the song\u2019s opening line, which she changes from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28.\n\nUnaltered in the press release were Swift\u2019s comments about the other track: \u201c\u2018Delicate\u2019 is a song about the vulnerability that immediately surfaces in all of us the minute we meet someone we want to like us,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe think about everything they might\u2019ve heard about us, every reason they wouldn\u2019t want us. Every step forward toward that other person scares us, but it thrills us too. \u2018Delicate\u2019 is about the balancing act of the rush and the fear and hoping it\u2019s really worth it to take that chance.\u201d\n\nThe singles session was Swift\u2019s second Spotify exclusive in recent weeks, along with the \u201cDelicate\u201d vertical video.
