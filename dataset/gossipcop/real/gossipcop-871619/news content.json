Oh, and the show isn't just any show. It's basically the Monday Night Football of reality TV. Women and men tune all over America tune in once a week to see whether you get a rose from the same charming and conventionally attractive dude that 20 other girls are vying for. It's safe to say the mascara you swipe on and foundation you apply are more important than ever. We chatted with six of our favorite ladies who have been there done that on past seasons of The Bachelor, Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelorette to get behind-the-scenes Bachelor beauty secrets.\n\nSave these ideas for later\u2014and follow Allure on Pinterest!\n\nOlivia Caridi\n\nThe Bachelor Season 20 (Ben Higgins)\n\nHow did you decide what to pack in your makeup bag for The Bachelor?\n\nI've never been that great at doing makeup, so I had a professional makeup artist come to my house to teach me how to do everything and make me a list of everything I needed to buy. She taught me how to contour. I didn't even know what that was. She works with people on reality TV, so she knew that there wouldn't be a lot of sleeping, so she advised on buying a white or a nude eye liner to put on my eyes to make them look bigger, which I didn't even know was a thing. Then, a couple days before filming, I went to Sephora and bought foundation, eye shadow palettes, brow fillers, like every single thing you could ever imagine. That was fun and expensive, but it was worth it.\n\nDid the makeup artist's tricks help you out?\n\nI think I screwed up. Of course the first day, you're thinking, \"Oh my god. This is so exciting. I'm going to wake up and put makeup on.\" Then, as the time goes on, I just kind of got lazier and lazier. Now, people recognize me more in public when I'm not wearing makeup than when I am. That's probably a sign that I should have tried a little bit harder the whole time when it came to doing my makeup every morning. But you get comfortable. The cameras are just there all the time, so you don't even think about looking pretty.\n\nHow long did people take in the morning to do their makeup?", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/589cfc0eb02f3ebc310e2e2a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pinnable-Bachelor-Beauty-Confessions.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Abelman", "Devon Abelma"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/bachelor-contestant-beauty-secret-confessions", "title": "These 5 Bachelor Beauty Secrets From Former Contestants Will Kinda Blow Your Mind", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Devon Abelman", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "We chatted with some of our favorite ladies from past seasons to learn some Bachelor beauty secrets and tips.", "id": "577199b82554df47220a5779", "keywords": "celebrity,celebrity trends,celebrities,catherine giudici,ashlet iaconetti,jillian harris,sarah herron,courtney robertson,olivia caridi,pinterest,the bachelor,the bachelorette", "news_keywords": "celebrity,celebrity trends,celebrities,catherine giudici,ashlet iaconetti,jillian harris,sarah herron,courtney robertson,olivia caridi,pinterest,the bachelor,the bachelorette", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "577199b82554df47220a5779", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We chatted with some of our favorite ladies from past seasons to learn some Bachelor beauty secrets and tips.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd1b4d8952dae4dc100f9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-18%20at%203.33.54%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd1b4d8952dae4dc100f9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-18%20at%203.33.54%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "All we needed was a one-on-one date with some of our favorite ladies.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "These Beauty Secrets From Past Bachelor Contestants Are Actually Jaw Dropping", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/bachelor-contestant-beauty-secret-confessions"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "All we needed was a one-on-one date with some of our favorite ladies.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "These Beauty Secrets From Past Bachelor Contestants Are Actually Jaw Dropping"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
