I learnt early on to shut things off so those things didn\u2019t come my way.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nShe added, \u201cI only heard what Harvey wanted people to hear, and that made me so f\u2014\u2014 angry. People would say, \u2018Well, you know how she got that role? She f\u2014\u2013 Harvey.\u2019 I would say, \u2018Shut the f\u2014 up. You don\u2019t know that.\u2019 Then, later, to find out that woman was brutally attacked \u2026 They didn\u2019t sleep with Harvey. Harvey wanted you to think that.\u201d\n\nWeinstein\u2019s attorney Benjamin Brafman responded to the actress\u2019s comments with a statement: \u201cBy her own admission, Harvey Weinstein never had an unpleasant interaction with Sandra Bullock. Indeed, from a review of her correspondence with Mr. Weinstein, it would appear that she had a warm pleasant relationship with him and even his daughter going back many years. Accordingly, with all due respect to Ms Bullock, it is not right for her to take unproven \u2018allegations\u2019 and republicize them in an effort to deprive Mr Weinstein of due process and possibly a fair trial that every citizen in this great country is entitled to. In America, the presumption of \u2018innocence\u2019 is supposed to have meaning. When piling on becomes the norm simply because it seems to be the politically correct or fashionable thing to do, we all lose, including Ms Bullock.\u201d\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 60 women, previously told PEOPLE in a statement that \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\u201d\n\nAfter women began speaking out about their alleged experiences with Weinstein, Bullock said she became \u201creally, really scared\u201d about the consequences these \u201cbrave people\u201d might suffer for coming forward.\n\nImage zoom Sandra Bullock. Dave Benett/WireImage\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is amazing, but f\u2014, f\u2014, f\u2014, what if it doesn\u2019t work? Please God, let it not swing the other way.\u2019 We\u2019re in such uncharted territory right now. I\u2019ve seen a lot of fear and a lot of men of a certain generation not understanding,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI saw a tremendous amount of fear from men on set,\u201d she continued, without naming any specific movie. \u201cIn the end, I said, \u2018I know you\u2019re scared, but I feel safe, so you can make some jokes now. But if you cross the line, I will f\u2014 you up.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBullock said that earlier in her career she had used her humor to deflect unwanted advances. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019ve always navigated tricky situations. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived. Because very early on in my career I had a situation on a film, which was hard. It came from a person of authority. I kept deflecting it with humor and it didn\u2019t work. Finally, I said, \u2018Please just fire me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe did not name the person of authority or the film in question.\n\nRELATED: Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein Surrenders to Authorities on Rape Charges\n\n\u201cIt was a lesson. After that, I tended to remove anything that could be misconstrued as sexual. I locked it down,\u201d she explained.\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein pleaded not guilty earlier this month to multiple sexual assault charges \u2014 including rape \u2014 brought against him in New York City. The criminal sex act charge is in connection with an alleged 2004 sexual assault on aspiring actress Lucia Evans, police sources previously confirmed to PEOPLE. (Evans has agreed to be publicly named).\n\nWeinstein is scheduled to return to court on Sept. 22 for a hearing on motions in his case, according to N.Y.C. prosecutors.\n\nHis lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement last week that he was not surprised by the indictment, noting that it \u201cdoes not add anything to the case we did not already know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein intends to \u2026 vigorously defend against these unsupported allegations that he strongly denies,\u201d Brafman said. \u201cWe will soon formally move to dismiss the indictment and if this case actually proceeds to trial, we expect Mr. Weinstein to be acquitted.\u201d\n\nBullock\u2019s new film, the female-driven Ocean\u2019s 8, is in theaters now.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fsandra-bullock2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1494&h=782&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fsandra-bullock2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1494&h=782&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fsandra-bullock2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sandra-bullock-afraid-harvey-weinstein-really-scared-women-spoke-out/", "title": "Sandra Bullock Was 'Afraid' of Harvey Weinstein and 'Really, Really Scared' When Women Spoke Out", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Sandra Bullock", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Sandra Bullock", "description": "\"I wasn't asked to be in that world.
