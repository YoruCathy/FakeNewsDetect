The product in question? An underwear-clad blow-up doll with Kimmel\u2019s face.\n\nDeGeneres asked Damon a series of leading questions about the product, and the Cambridge native\u2019s answers left the audience in hysterics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\n\u2014 On how to use the product: \u201cIt depends. Some people use it more than once a day; some people use it once a week. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. It\u2019s versatile and very user-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On how using the product makes Damon feel: \u201cRelaxed. Which is really the goal. At the end of a stressful day, you want to kick back and relax a bit.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On his wife\u2019s opinion of the product: \u201cWell, that\u2019s who I heard about it from. She called me \u2014 I was at work \u2014 and she said, \u2018Hey, this is a hell of a product.'\u201d", "images": ["https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-matt-damon-blow-up-doll-850x478.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=813236348753005&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/newsletter-modal/boston-globe-logo.svg", "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/bglobe-logo-gray.png", "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/loveletters-logo-black.png"], "top_img": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-matt-damon-blow-up-doll-850x478.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Slane", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/10/26/watch-matt-damon-sell-a-half-naked-jimmy-kimmel-blow-up-doll", "title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 1562643324032681, "pages": 6879409364}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "creator": "kevin-slane", "image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-matt-damon-blow-up-doll-850x478.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/largetile.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-Bug-Logo@2x-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index", "og": {"title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "site_name": "Boston.com", "url": "https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/10/26/watch-matt-damon-sell-a-half-naked-jimmy-kimmel-blow-up-doll", "image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-matt-damon-blow-up-doll-850x478.jpg", "updated_time": "2017-10-26T12:23:18-0400"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "author": "kevin-slane", "section": "Culture", "tag": "TV", "published_time": "2017-10-26T12:23:18-0400", "modified_time": "2017-10-26T12:23:18-0400", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9mv8_OcYysU?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1508947200.0, "source": "https://www.boston.com", "summary": ""}
