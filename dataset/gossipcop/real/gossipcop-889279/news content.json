On the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of TBS\u2019 new sketch show, Drop the Mic, which pins two celebs up against each other in an epic rap battle, both Berry and Corden got in some personal digs.\n\nIt all began with Berry\u2019s career choices. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend that Catwoman didn\u2019t suck. Halle, that was a Batman movie, how\u2019d you mess that up?\u201d Corden began. However, she was ready!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad Swordfish was to your satisfaction. It\u2019s probably the only time your d-ck has seen some action,\u201d she rapped. \u201cYes, everybody knows Catwoman tanked, but I took Kingsman to the mother f-ckin\u2019 bank\u2026 James has a Tony, that\u2019s cool and all. But I have an Oscar, so suck my monster balls.\u201d\n\nFrom there, he got personal.\n\n\u201cHalle is a classic. This whole thing\u2019s tragic. You\u2019re just Viola Davis but not as charismatic,\u201d he rapped. \u201cSure you won an Oscar but I question the voters. I use my Gothica DVD as a drink coaster\u2026 2008 you were Sexiest Woman Alive. Was that a moment when Beyonc\u00e9 briefly died?\u201d\n\nThe late night host ended with the divorce jokes, while she ended with a sex dig.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to getting married, three divorces is enough. Forget signing autographs. Sign a prenup,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done so many X-Men movies, maybe a dozen. I heard X-Men and I thought it was about your husbands.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, why are you so angry and pushy? Of course, you hated Catwoman you never get p\u2013sy,\u201d Berry said.\n\nIn the end, she was named the clear winner.\n\nDrop the Mic airs on TBS on Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/halle-berry-crushes-james-corden-in-rap-battle-watch/", "title": "Halle Berry Crushes James Corden in Rap Battle: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "James Corden may be able to sing karaoke, but it\u2019s Halle Berry who just crushed him on the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of 'Drop the Mic' \u2014 watch here", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Halle Berry Crush James Corden in Epic Rap Battle", "description": "James Corden may be able to sing karaoke, but it\u2019s Halle Berry who just crushed him on the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of 'Drop the Mic' \u2014 watch here", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/halle-berry-crushes-james-corden-in-rap-battle-watch/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Fall TV", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-25T16:35:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:43+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "James Corden may be able to sing karaoke, but it\u2019s Halle Berry who just crushed him on the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of 'Drop the Mic' \u2014 watch here", "title": "Watch Halle Berry Crush James Corden in Epic Rap Battle", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halle-berry-james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508949352.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
