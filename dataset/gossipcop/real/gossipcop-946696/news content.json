(AP) \u2014 A 9-year-old English bulldog was named the winner of the 2018 World's Ugliest Dog contest in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nZsa Zsa won the title Saturday night at the Sonoma-Marin Sonoma-Marin Fairgrounds in Petaluma.\n\nThe dog's owner Megan Brainard of Anoka, Minnesota, will receive $1,500 for Zsa Zsa's win. Brainard found Zsa Zsa on a pet-finding site, according to the contest bio.\n\nDogs in the annual competition flaunt their imperfections - some have hairless bodies, others have lolling tongues. The dogs and their handlers walk down a red carpet. The dogs are evaluated by a panel of judges.\n\nThe contestants included a blackhead-covered Chinese Crested-Dachshund mutt, a bulldog mix with excess wrinkly skin and a Pekingese named Wild Thang.\n\nLast year's winner was a 125-pound (57-kilogram) gentle giant named Martha \u2014 a Neopolitan Mastiff with gas and a droopy face.\n\nThe contest is in its 30th year. It is usually held on Friday nights, but organizers moved the competition to Saturday in an effort to draw a bigger audience.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/733168e2f7f04af6b4bf44de18d9552b49964a57/c=0-405-5472-3497/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654577738498356-EPA-epaselect-USA-WORLDS-UGLIEST-DOG-CONTEST.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34cb5eda691ff9a6e01ec3cce921a2fb6d477260/c=0-187-3877-2377/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654578502868464-AFP-AFP-16I9RJ.1.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34cb5eda691ff9a6e01ec3cce921a2fb6d477260/c=0-187-3877-2377/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654578502868464-AFP-AFP-16I9RJ.1.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/06/24/worlds-ugliest-dog-zsa-zsa-english-bulldog/729360002/", "title": "World's Ugliest Dog title goes to ...
