Raven Baxter is back.\n\n\u201cRaven has not changed,\u201d Raven-Symone tells ET. \u201cI think Raven Baxter is still that fun, kooky, crazy, down for whatever, here for friends girl. But now, she has kids. So, she\u2019s a lot more [about] teaching them to be just as crazy as her, in a loving way.\u201d\n\nRaven-Symone, 31, returns to Disney Channel on Friday with Raven\u2019s Home, a sequel series to her hit, That\u2019s So Raven, which stopped airing new episodes a decade ago.\n\n\u201cOye, I thought it was longer,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI feel like it was about 15 to 20 [years] \u2026 I had never seen a show born from the ground up, as I've seen Raven\u2019s Home grow. So, it's a little bit like, 'Wow!\u2019 I stepped outside of my body for a second, and this is actually happening.\u201d\n\n\n\nWATCH: The Raven\u2019s Home Theme Song Is Here -- Get a First Listen!\n\nET caught up with the star on set of the reboot, which finds Raven, her twin children, her best friend, Chelsea, and Chelsea\u2019s son all living together in an apartment.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Why Raven-Symone and Anneliese van der Pol Call 'Raven's Home' Their 'Dream Come True' This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

But I was talking to my mom -- she came to visit me on the set for the first two weeks -- and she was like, \u2018You\u2019re acting more like a dad. Like, be nicer.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Uh. Let\u2019s go people.\u2019 I\u2019m trying my hardest to be as motherly as I can. But we also have a job to do. So, it\u2019s a little bit of momager-ing I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is still a job,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re having fun, but we have a job to do and we have to get this show on the road.\u201d\n\nYes, this time Raven has another title beyond \u201cstar.\u201d She\u2019s also the series\u2019 executive producer.\n\n\u201cSometimes [I\u2019m the boss],\u201d she jokes. \u201cNot all the time.\u201d\n\n\n\nWATCH: Raven-Symone Reveals Why Now Was the Right Time to Reboot That\u2019s So Raven\n\n\n\nRaven\u2019s Home reunites Raven with her That\u2019s So Raven co-star Anneliese van der Pol, who returns as Chelsea.\n\n\u201cIt's just a dream come true,\u201d Raven says. \u201cAn utter dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had talked about working together maybe four years after That's So Raven happened,\u201d she admits. \u201cWe both were like 'This has to happen. This has to happen. We need a job. We've got bills.'\u201d\n\nAnneliese confesses her favorite part of the whole experience has been working with Raven again.\n\n\u201cI mean, she's so talented, and that's so obvious, but I don't know if I've worked with somebody opposite, comedically, that I thought was so good,\u201d Anneliese tells ET. \u201cJust watching her, and being entertained by her, but also to work with her? It's nice to have that back and get into our rhythm.\n\n\u201cIt's like [we] never left,\u201d she says. \u201cI don't know. I can't explain that feeling. It's almost as if, after you do a show, you take a bow. It feels like that, without taking the bow. It's so gratifying.\u201d\n\nRaven\u2019s reaction: \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to compare it with,\u201d she confesses. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s like eating a biscuit with gravy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels natural,\u201d Anneliese says. \u201cIt feels good. It feels very fulfilling.\u201d\n\n\n\nWATCH: Get a Hilarious First Look at Raven\u2019s Home\n\nBoth ladies say there\u2019s a lot to look forward to on the show, for fans both old and new.\n\n'Raven's Home' Star Anneliese van der Pol Says Chelsea Still Isn't 'With It' After All These Years This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page. Embed Code Restart\n\n\u201cI'm most excited for the fans of That\u2019s So Raven to see how Chelsea and Raven have interacted [over the years],\u201d Raven teases. \u201cThere's this funny through storyline that we don't really dive into, we always touch on, and I think they'll appreciate what Raven and Chelsea did between the years of That's So Raven and Raven's Home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we did on our summer breaks,\u201d she explains. \u201cHow we were in college. You don't see them. You missed it, but we allude to it so many different times in the sense of, \u2018We run a submarine one summer.\u2019 What were we doing there? You have to watch to find out. I love that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm really happy for [That\u2019s So Raven] fans to see Raven and Chelsea [as] two women leading this household, raising their children in a different kind of family dynamic,\u201d Anneliese shares. \u201cI think that's something that they'll want to see with their children. Especially mothers.\u201d\n\n\n\nRaven\u2019s Home premieres Friday night on Disney Channel after the debut of the channel\u2019s latest original movie, Descendants 2.\n\nCheck out the videos above to see more from Raven and Anneliese -- including an exclusive tour of their characters\u2019 closets -- then, watch the one below to learn more about Raven\u2019s Home from the kids of the show, Issac Brown, Navia Robinson, Sky Katz and Jason Maybaum.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAA=", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_et_thatsoraven_071917.jpg?itok=VmKWRVAm"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_et_thatsoraven_071917.jpg?itok=VmKWRVAm", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brice Sander"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tv/221882_exclusive_ravens_home_wardrobe_tour", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Raven-Symone Calls 'Raven's Home' a Dream -- Why Playing a Mom Has Her Thinking About Becoming One!", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Raven-Symone Calls 'Raven's Home' a Dream -- Why Playing a Mom Has Her Thinking About Becoming One! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tv/221882_exclusive_ravens_home_wardrobe_tour", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Raven-Symone Calls 'Raven's Home' a Dream -- Why Playing a Mom Has Her Thinking About Becoming One!", "description": "Plus, get an exclusive tour of the show's wardrobe department!", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_et_thatsoraven_071917.jpg?itok=VmKWRVAm", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Plus, get an exclusive tour of the show's wardrobe department!", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Raven-Symone Calls 'Raven's Home' a Dream -- Why Playing a Mom Has Her Thinking About Becoming One!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Brice Sander", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tv/221882_exclusive_ravens_home_wardrobe_tour", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_et_thatsoraven_071917.jpg?itok=VmKWRVAm"}, "description": "Plus, get an exclusive tour of the show's wardrobe department!", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, Raven Symone", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
