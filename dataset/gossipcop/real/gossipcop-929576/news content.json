The 44-year-old actor has two daughters and believes that being a dad is \u201cthe greatest blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized being a father is the greatest job I have ever had and the greatest job I will ever have,\u201d he said on \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d in 2015, before his second daughter was born.\n\n\u201cThroughout the years, throughout the ups and downs, I\u2019ve realized that the most important thing that I could do with my daughter is lead our life with love,\u201d he said. \u201cNot success, not fame, not anything else but, \u2018I\u2019m always here for you. I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Rock had his first daughter, 15-year-old Simone, during his first marriage to Dany Garcia. He then welcomed his second daughter, one-year-old Jasmine, in December 2015 with his longtime partner Lauren Hashian.\n\nSince having kids, Johnson has proven time and again that he is the sweetest dad. Here, we round up The Rock\u2019s cutest moments with his girls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI'm always asked - What inspires YOU?\u201d he wrote on Instagram last year. \u201cMy answer's easy and honest.. what inspires me the most is always waitin' for me to walk thru my front door when I come home.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOn an episode of \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d in 2015, Johnson recalled a time he asked his teen daughter, \u201cWhat is the thing that you love most about our relationship?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Well, that I trust you,\u2019\u201d he said, tearing up. \u201cFor a 13-year-old girl to say that to her dad... She said, \u2018I trust you, and we have a very special bond.\u2019 And that moved me. At 13, she\u2019s saying that and, you know, I couldn\u2019t ask for anything else. I love that girl.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though The Rock was tired and sweating, he kept on dancing just to make his baby girl smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what daddies do,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nCue the \"awws.\"\n\nA photo posted by therock (@therock) on Oct 21, 2016 at 12:56am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's the most unique, powerful, loving, irreplaceable, one-of-a-kind bond on earth. The bond between a father and his daughter,\u201d Johnson wrote on Instagram in October. \u201cSo proud [of] you [Simone] for the young woman you've become and so grateful for the bond we have. I take complete credit for your wit and charm. All that brains and beauty you got go to your mama.\u201d\n\nTeaching 'em young to start applauding the moment daddy starts singing. Smart girl. Answering my egotistical questions is clearly a work in progress;). Happy 1st Birthday baby girl.

And always make sure you do it in a positive way with class, dignity and respect.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe responded by poo'ing on me in this moment as she plays her favourite game, \u2018Drum time on daddy's big head.\u2019 It was a good talk.\u201d\n\nFresh off the #MrOlympia stage.. bringin' my Man of The Century ICON award AND my baby girl @simonealex_ back home. #LuckyDad #AGoodTimeFlex #AndEmbarrassMyDaughter\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udcaf A photo posted by therock (@therock) on Sep 17, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wasn't even fazed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e9a2d442500005706eafd90.jpeg?cache=mUes4Li2K0&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99bd0b220000fb028272fd.jpeg?cache=UF5rhVRaZ1&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd657912100003100c5034f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e98a0ea2200009702827212.jpeg?cache=B9IIUEyRbs&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e9619f0300000a6051541fd.jpeg?cache=O65DhZNGWM&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e9a72d9250000320beafd97.jpeg?cache=0n0z1guC8P&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e98805f2200008b018271ea.png?cache=lrKP0WzEXT&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd657922500005600a5b01e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e9a5dbe220000cc04827365.jpeg?cache=qHo9tApnGv&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99f009220000f00282733d.jpeg?cache=jUWvJ9jUes&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e960a2c250000641a6b7c23.png?cache=Ho4oLcqhdJ&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e97254a300000a8051542d5.png?cache=OZvdWdvZbM&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99b603220000fc028272eb.jpeg?cache=AwIq8DW6rt&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e98a9dd3000005f06154569.jpeg?cache=Hi06Q6VXFJ&ops=434_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99de1425000050236b80f4.png?cache=RDBIE2JGeB&ops=434_244"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd657912100003100c5034f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isabelle Khoo", "The Huffington Post Canada"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/02/14/dwayne-johnson-daughters_n_14726902.html", "title": "All The Times The Rock Proved He Was The Sweetest Dad", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffingtonpost.ca", "locale": "en-CA", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "description": "The 44-year-old actor has two daughters: Simone and Jasmine.", "keywords": "celebrity parents dwayne johnson dwayne johnson daughters dwayne johnson instagram dwayne johnson kids jasmine johnson parents parents video simone johnson the rock the rock instagram video", "og": {"title": "All The Times The Rock Proved He Was The Sweetest Dad", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd657912100003100c5034f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd657912100003100c5034f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/02/14/dwayne-johnson-daughters_n_14726902.html", "site_name": "HuffPost Canada", "locale": "en_CA", "description": "The 44-year-old actor has two daughters: Simone and Jasmine."}, "article": {"tag": "celebrity parents dwayne johnson dwayne johnson daughters dwayne johnson instagram dwayne johnson kids jasmine johnson parents parents video simone johnson the rock the rock instagram video", "section": "Parents", "published_time": "2017-02-14T06:18:26Z", "modified_time": "2017-02-14T06:18:27Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostCaLife", "title": "All The Times The Rock Proved He Was The Sweetest Dad", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd657912100003100c5034f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The 44-year-old actor has two daughters: Simone and Jasmine."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=ca&entryID=ca_5cd65791e4b086420a8a4154", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:standard,max-video-preview:-1", "taboola.category": "parents"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1487001600.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.ca", "summary": ""}
