Prior to becoming an item in 2015, Shelton had split from wife Miranda Lambert and Stefani from husband Gavin Rossdale after his alleged cheating scandal. However, Stefani told Morales that it's these similarities in their past relationships that have actually brought them closer as couple.\n\nRELATED: Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Plan to Have a Baby Via Surrogate: Report\n\nSo, close it seems, that the performer now considers Shelton her \u201cforever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s your forever, right?\u201d Morales asked Stefani.\n\n\u201cI hope so!\u201d she shared. \u201cI never thought I would get this moment, and so it\u2019s just really special.\n\nWhile we couldn\u2019t be happier for the mom of three, we can\u2019t say that we were surprised by her response given that Shelton said almost the exact same thing last month when he admitted to ET that the \u201cforever\u201d lyric in the pair\u2019s romantic duet, \u201cYou Make It Feel Like Christmas,\u201d was \u201cof course\u201d about their relationship.\n\nImage zoom Rachel Murray/Getty Images\n\nThough the couple won\u2019t be getting engaged anytime soon, we can rest assured knowing that after three years of dating, our favorite couple is still \u201cmadly in love\u201d per People\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cBlake has wanted to take his time with marriage, but he is absolutely committed to Gwen,\u201d a source told People. \u201cThey both feel they\u2019ve found their true partner in life and plan to be together forever.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2F1518548356%2F021318-gwen-stefani-glasses-7.jpg%3Fitok%3D_3D8Ge8Q", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-946698504.jpg%3Fitok%3DimOMIvxw", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2F1518548356%2F021318-gwen-stefani-glasses-5.jpg%3Fitok%3D4zdKJ282"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-946698504.jpg%3Fitok%3DimOMIvxw", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Camille Nzengung"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/gwen-stefani-shuts-down-blake-shelton-engagement-rumors", "title": "Gwen Stefani Hints That Blake Shelton Is Her \"Forever\" Man", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "latest,News,Star Couples,Celebrity,Gwen Stefani,Blake Shelton", "news_keywords": "latest,News,Star Couples,Celebrity,Gwen Stefani,Blake Shelton", "description": "Gwen Stefani shared in a new interview that she and boyfriend Blake Shelton are holding off on getting engaged due to \"trauma\"", "og": {"title": "Gwen Stefani Hints That Blake Shelton Is Her \"Forever\" Man", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/gwen-stefani-shuts-down-blake-shelton-engagement-rumors", "description": "But about those engagement rumors ...", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-946698504.jpg%3Fitok%3DimOMIvxw"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/gwen-stefani-shuts-down-blake-shelton-engagement-rumors", "description": "Gwen Stefani shared in a new interview that she and boyfriend Blake Shelton are holding off on getting engaged due to \"trauma\"", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-946698504.jpg%3Fitok%3DimOMIvxw"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/gwen-stefani-shuts-down-blake-shelton-engagement-rumors", "title": "Gwen Stefani Hints That Blake Shelton Is Her \"Forever\" Man", "description": "But about those engagement rumors ...", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-946698504.jpg%3Fitok%3DimOMIvxw"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
