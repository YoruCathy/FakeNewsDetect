I think the potential fear of the whole situation is legitimate.\n\n\"You never know that you might not have the same type of problem that might be more serious this time. You're always taking a little bit of a chance. There are situations where retained placenta could be life and death.\"\n\nHer mother Kris, 61, then said: \"You could bleed to death\".\n\nWhat is toxaemia of pregnancy? During Kim\u2019s last two pregnancy she suffered from toxaemia \u2013 more commonly known as pre-eclampsia. It is a condition that can affect pregnant women, resulting in high blood pressure and damage to one or more organs, often the kidneys. It is usually diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy and can lead to serious complications for mother and baby.
