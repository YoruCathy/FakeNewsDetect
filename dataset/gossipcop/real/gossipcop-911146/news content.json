Other times, you just need to take a break and drink during the afternoon with Kelly Clarkson.\n\nThe Meaning of Life singer got totally toasted with Meyers in the sketch that aired Thursday night. It began by making the \u201cSimon Cowell,\u201d which is comprised of hot sauce, vodka, more hot sauce, bitters, and then even more hot sauce. Then there was the \u201cBlake Shelton\u201d and the \u201cGrammy\u201d (in honor of Meyers\u2019 grandma) before Meyers gave Clarkson a cognitive test.\n\nBut not just any cognitive test. Meyers administered the cognitive test given to President Donald Trump by his doctor. First Clarkson had to properly identify a sketch of a lion, and then she had to name as many words beginning with \u201cf\u201d she could think of.\n\n\u201cKelly, you got 18, which is really good,\u201d Meyers said.\n\n\u201cShut up, I\u2019m drunk!\u201d she declared.\n\nAnd what\u2019s day drinking without drunken karaoke? Just for the \u201cLove So Soft\u201d singer, the late-night host performed a dramatic rendition of \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d in their private bar.\n\nWatch above.", "images":
