The allegations broke two weeks ago, with multiple families of the women living with Kelly coming forward. Scroll through to see all the allegations against Kelly and his response, as previously reported by PopCulture.com's Sarah Halper.\n\nSlide 1/7 \u2013 The Accusations Against R. Kelly Family members of several women have told the police that the R&B legend is holding their daughters against their will in an abusive \u201ccult\u201d he formed. Three former members of Kelly\u2019s inner circle have spoken up about these claims and are telling similar stories. According to a report published by BuzzFeed News on Monday, the 50-year-old, whose full name is Robert Slyvester Kelly, has been holding the women at his homes in Atlanta, Georgia, and Chicago, Illinois. Parents of a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Georgia said they have had limited contact with their daughter since she met Kelly backstage at a concert in Indio, California in May 2015. Two other parents are fighting to get their daughter back from Kelly\u2019s ownership. Their daughter, an aspiring professional singer from Florida, met Kelly when she was 17 years old and moved into one of his rental properties shortly after she was of the legal age of consent. As the parents try and work with the police to get their daughters home, the former members of Kelly\u2019s inner circle \u2013 Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones and Asante McGree \u2013 provided details supporting the parent\u2019s worst fears. The women said Kelly has six females living in his properties and controls every aspect of their lives. He tells them what they can eat, how they dress, when they can bathe, when they are allowed to sleep and how they are suppose to engage in sexual encounters that he records and shares with his friends. One of the parents said their daughter is \u201cbrainwashed\u201d and \u201clooked like a prisoner\u201d the last time she saw her. In addition to his controlling manner, Kelly requires the women to call him \u201cDaddy,\u201d while he calls them his \u201cbabies.\u201d Each woman must ask his permission to leave the Chicago recording studio they stay at or their assigned rooms in his \u201cguest house\u201d in Atlanta. \u201cR. Kelly is the sweetest person you will ever want to meet,\u201d McGee said. \u201cBut Robert is the devil.\u201d\n\nSlide 2/7 \u2013 Who are the women? According to Mack, Jones and McGee, the women that live with Kelly, in addition to the 21-year-old Georgia singer, include: A 31-year-old \u201cden mother\u201d who teaches the newcomers the ways Kelly likes to be pleasured sexually. This woman was best friends with the girl that sued Kelly in 2008 for filming her in a sexual encounter at as a minor.\n\nA 25-year-old woman who has been apart of Kelly\u2019s crew for seven years.\n\nA 19-year-old model, who is relatively new to the \u201ccult.\u201d She was photographed in public with Kelly and named on multiple gossip websites, which is very uncommon for women in his circle.\n\nAn Atlanta songwriter who began her relationship with Kelly in 2009 when she was 19 years old.\n\nAn 18-year-old singer from Polk County, Florida, who Mack says is Kelly\u2019s \u201cfavorite \u2013 his number-one girl.\u201d The women in his inner circle are of legal age. In 2008, he was tried in Illinois on 14 charges of making child pornography and was acquitted. The prosecutors focused only on a single videotape that showed him having sex with a 14-year-old girl.\n\nSlide 3/7 \u2013 What are the rules? Mack, the star\u2019s former personal assistant, says Kelly has a long list of rules for the women. \"You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom. \u2026 [Kelly] is a master at mind control. ... He is a puppet master,\u201d she said. Kelly confiscates all of the women\u2019s cell phones and makes sure they do not contact their friends or family. He gives them new phones that they can only use to contact him or others with his permission. The \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d singer films his sexual activities with each girl and shows the videos to the men in his circle. He does not let the women dress in any clothes that will show off their figure. He tells them to dress in jogging suits because \u201che doesn\u2019t want their figures to be exposed; he doesn\u2019t want them to look appealing.\u201d When the women are in the same room as other men, they are expected to \u201cturn around and face the wall in their jogging suits because he doesn\u2019t want them to be looked at by anyone else.\u201d If any of the rules are broken, Kelly punishes them physically and verbally. For example, Jones, who lived with and had sexual relationship with Kelly, was once held against a tree and slapped for being too friendly to a male cashier at a restaurant.\n\nSlide 4/7 \u2013 The Atlanta singer's parents' plea for help... Backstage at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California, in May 2015, J. and her then-19-year-old daughter met with the R&B singer. The meeting was to help the teenager\u2019s music career move forward. After meeting for the first time in Atlanta the month earlier, Kelly flew the mother and daughter to his concert in California. \u201cWhen we got to go backstage with R. Kelly, we stayed there over two hours,\u201d said J. \u201cOne-on-one with just me and my daughter and him. We went back to talk about the music. He listened to her CD. He was going to help her with her CD, and I was really impressed with him at first, because I have always been an R. Kelly fan.\u201d Although J. heard about past sexual misconduct accusations against Kelly, she wasn\u2019t too worried about her daughter being around him in her presence. After their daughter\u2019s backstage visit with Kelly, the aspiring singer secretly talked to him on her cell phone without her parent\u2019s permission. \u201cAs far as I know, we weren\u2019t talking to [Kelly] anymore,\u201d J. said. \u201cOr at least I wasn\u2019t talking to him anymore.\u201d In June 2015, J. and Tim believed their daughter was going to visit a Georgia university, but instead went to Kelly\u2019s concert in Oklahoma City. This was the first time the teenager had sex with Kelly and later told her parents about the event. As the singer and Kelly grew closer, it began to appear all he cared about was sex and not advancing her music career. She recorded a conversation she had with Kelly and it immediately became clear his intentions. \u201cI miss my baby,\u201d Kelly told the woman, before asking her what she was wearing. After she replied, he told her: \u201cI want you to get in the habit of telling me what color panties you got on every day,\u201d he instructed repeatedly.\n\nSlide 5/7 \u2013 The Atlanta singer's parents plea for help (continued)... However, now two years later, J. and her husband Tim are desperate to get their daughter home. Their daughter isn\u2019t seen as a missing person in the eyes of the law because she is considered an adult. They now she is living with Kelly, but believe she is there \u201cagainst her will\u201d in what they call a \u201ccult.\u201d The last time they saw their daughter was on December 1, 2016. \u201cIt was as if she was brainwashed. [She] looked like a prisoner \u2014 it was horrible,\u201d J. said. \u201cI hugged her and hugged her. But she just kept saying she\u2019s in love and [Kelly] is the one who cares for her. I don\u2019t know what to do. I hope that if I get her back, I can get her treatment for victims of cults. They can reprogram her. But I wish I could have stopped it from happening.\u201d The police in both Illinois and Georgia have completed welfare checks in the past year, but they did not lead to any charges for Kelly. The aspiring singer from Georgia told the police she was \u201cfine and did not want to be bothered.\u201d The singer enrolled in college, but her studies quickly declined. Her college roommate, identified as T.S., recalls plenty of times being told disturbing details of the girl\u2019s relationship with Kelly. In the middle of her first semester in college, the singer began losing weight, chopped off her long hair and dyed in blonde because Kelly liked it that way. After numerous attempts at saving their daughter and failing, the parents are begging for help. \u201cIt\u2019s not about my daughter, per se. It\u2019s about all the girls,\u201d Tim said. \u201cIt\u2019s about my daughter, and I understand that. But the abuse that my daughter is actually enduring, nobody should go through.\u201d\n\nSlide 6/7 \u2013 More parents are speaking out... The parents of the aspiring Florida singer have also spoken out. A similar situation occurred with their daughter and the Georgia singer. Kelly was \u201csupposed to be a music relationship\u201d for their daughter, but that quickly changed. \u201cMy thing was I trusted. I have never been in the music industry before, ever,\u201d Theresa, the Florida singer\u2019s mother, said. \u201cHe is a lyrical genius \u2014 he is R. Kelly! And the fact is he went to court, he was never found guilty \u2014 he was acquitted \u2014 and we were led to believe there was no truth in it. Now I got all of these people asking about why my daughter is there, telling me, \u2018All of that, the charges against Kelly, was true.\u2019 Well, how come you didn\u2019t tell me that before?\u201d The Florida singer first met Kelly in Orlando on April 18, 2015. \u201cDuring the show, they were pulling people out of the audience,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cA guy said, \u2018Oh yeah, her.\u2019 He pulled her up onstage.\u201d Kelly and the then 17-year-old girl exchanged numbers, and started a relationship over phone calls and text messages \u2013 all of which was kept a secret. One day, the parents started worrying about their daughter who had not returned home from school. They found out she was with Kelly at a near by hotel and called the police. After the hotel incident, the teenager was only allowed to talk to Kelly when a parent was present. After a few weeks, Kelly offered to take her on tour with him to \u201cmentor her.\u201d The parents allowed it, seeing it as an \u201copportunity\u201d for her and made sure she had a female guardian with her. Shortly after the tour, the teen moved in with Kelly and lost contact with her parents. McGee, one of the women who left Kelly, said he is \u201cobsessed\u201d with the Florida singer and she is \u201chead over heels\u201d for him. Kelly even \u201cwould go into the kitchen and cook for her.\u201d It appears no lawyer or police authority can help the parents get their daughters home, since they are not considered kidnapped or missing. \u201cI have not talked to my daughter in more than a year,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had deaths in the family, birthdays, and I haven\u2019t heard from her and she hasn\u2019t been here for any of it. I didn\u2019t even hear from her on Mother\u2019s Day. All I want to do is bring her home.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/music/2017/07/30/r-kelly-cult/", "title": "R.
