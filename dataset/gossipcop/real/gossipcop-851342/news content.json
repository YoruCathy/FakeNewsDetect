But then you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, she needs to like come out already,\u201d The Girl on the Train actress told Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest.\n\nPrepon went onto to share her pregnancy cravings: \u201c[My dad] was a doctor and when he would have a break we would go to this Jewish deli. We would get this pastrami on rye sandwich with a Dr. Brown\u2019s black cherry soda. When I was a kid that\u2019s what we would get with my dad. With like mustard and sauerkraut. What\u2019s so funny is I have not eaten that stuff probably since I was a kid with my dad. So when I got pregnant, all of a sudden I was like, \u2018I need a pastrami on rye. I need a Dr. Brown\u2019s black cherry soda. I need mustard and sauerkraut.\u2019 These crazy Jewish deli cravings hit me so hard. Isn\u2019t that funny?\u201d\n\nPrepon opened up about her pregnancy to Us Weekly in an exclusive interview on July 17, calling the experience \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m creating life and it\u2019s so incredible. I\u2019m so ecstatic for this experience, but you go through so many changes. We\u2019ve been in the Pacific North West keeping it low-key. I\u2019m a very private person,\u201d the Karla actress gushed.\n\nPrepon and Foster, 36, who began dating in July 2016 have been friends since they were teenagers. The couple announced their engagement last October.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645372682_ben-foster-laura-prepon-zoom-c90b509e-6aa1-4b35-beea-b8f721862b7e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/658477790_laura-prepon-ben-foster-zoom-ea62dbc0-2530-47ed-9d8b-e58b9b878ac7.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645372682_ben-foster-laura-prepon-zoom-7d240a08-3f73-4e0b-8cee-7575e974055d.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645372682_ben-foster-laura-prepon-zoom-c90b509e-6aa1-4b35-beea-b8f721862b7e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/laura-prepon-gives-birth-welcomes-first-child-with-fiance-ben-foster-w492812/", "title": "Laura Prepon Welcomes First Child With Fiance Ben Foster", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 star Laura Prepon and her fianc\u00e9, Ben Foster, have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Laura Prepon Welcomes First Child With Fiance Ben Foster", "description": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 star Laura Prepon and her fianc\u00e9, Ben Foster, have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/laura-prepon-gives-birth-welcomes-first-child-with-fiance-ben-foster-w492812/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-16T00:05:53+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645372682_ben-foster-laura-prepon-zoom-c90b509e-6aa1-4b35-beea-b8f721862b7e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645372682_ben-foster-laura-prepon-zoom-c90b509e-6aa1-4b35-beea-b8f721862b7e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-08-23T22:17:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-16T00:05:53+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 star Laura Prepon and her fianc\u00e9, Ben Foster, have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "title": "Laura Prepon Welcomes First Child With Fiance Ben Foster", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645372682_ben-foster-laura-prepon-zoom-c90b509e-6aa1-4b35-beea-b8f721862b7e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503526620.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
