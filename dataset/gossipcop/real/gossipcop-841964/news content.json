This episode is going to be especially trippy because it\u2019s going back to the very beginning.\n\nWe all know that Olivia Pope, with the help of Fitz\u2019s then-wife Mellie Grant and Fitz\u2019s campaign manager, turned White House Chief Of Staff, Cyrus Beene fixed the election so that Fitz could take the Presidency. However, what if that never happened? What if the election was never rigged, and Fitz never became the President of the United States?!\n\nIt seems implausible to consider now, so many years down the line, but this is a Shonda Rhimes show, so she\u2019s going for it. The official episode summary states, \u201cWith the ugly truth behind Frankie\u2019s assassination revealed, a torn Olivia (Kerry Washington) wonders how different her life \u2014 and the country \u2014 would be if she, Mellie (Bellamy Young) and Cyrus (Jeff Perry) had never rigged Fitz\u2019s (Tony Goldwyn) election.\u201d\n\nThe cast of Scandal recently attended the PaleyFest conference and gave some small hints about what we can expect to see during \u201cThe Decision\u201d, which apparently has a very \u201cseason one vibe.\u201d Tony Goldwyn who plays Fitz said, \u201cIt also informs your understanding of all of us now when we get back to our \u2018normal\u2019 Scandal episodes.\u201d To be honest, we doubt Olivia and Fitz are together in this alternative universe, Liv has always wanted the White House, and without it, we doubt Fitz has very much appeal to her.\n\n~spoiler alert!\n\nIn Scandal\u2019s current storyline, we\u2019re just trying to figure out if Huck is going to survive those bullet wounds that Abby ordered. Are you excited about \u201cThe Decision?\u201d\n\nScandal\u2019s 100th episode airs April 13th at 9 PM ET on ABC.", "images":
