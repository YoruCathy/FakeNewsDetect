The post included the single cover art and credits of \"Feels\".[4]\n\nCritical reception\n\nAndy Cush of Spin called the song a little flimsy, but an unimpeachable groove. \"It has a skillful melange of sounds from the mid-70s apex of analog recording, the era of disco and yacht rock: a warm and rounded bassline, some Nile Rodgers-style guitar, a slick descending line on Fender Rhodes.\"[5] Rolling Stone's Elia Leight said that the song is \"a simple, lighthearted loop, which combines punctual ska guitar, a playful keyboard line and charming squeaks that recall a cartoon character's slip on a banana peel.\"[6] Brent Faulkner from The Musical Hype said the song is undercooked, leaving more to be desired, adding that it's \"the type of record that is pleasing more because of the sound than the lyricism.\"[7]\n\nMusic video\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was uploaded to Harris' Vevo channel on YouTube on 26 June 2017. The music video was directed by Emil Nava.[8] In the video, Harris, Williams, Perry and Big Sean lounge around on a desert island.[9]\n\nPersonnel\n\nCredits adapted from the song's liner notes.[4]\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/Sales Australia (ARIA)[59] Platinum 70,000^ Italy (FIMI)[60] Gold 25,000 New Zealand (RMNZ)[61] Gold 15,000* United Kingdom (BPI)[62] Gold 400,000 *sales figures based on certification alone\n\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\nsales+streaming figures based on certification alone\n\nRelease history\n\nCountry Date Format Label Ref.
