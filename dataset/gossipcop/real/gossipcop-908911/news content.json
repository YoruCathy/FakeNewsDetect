After expressing how proud he was, he quietly said: \"Thank you to everybody that works so hard for us. It's a real joy to make music.\"\n\nThen producer Dave Cobb offered a few thanks and the men walked off stage to allow the upcoming Las Vegas and Manchester tribute plenty of space.\n\nDonny Wahlberg and his co-presenter Hailee Steinfeld referenced Johnny Cash in introducing the nominees, and then put on cowboy hats (as country fans nationwide groaned) to do the honor.\n\nLady Antebellum's Heart Break, Kenny Chesney's Cosmic Hallelujah, Little Big Town's The Breaker and Thomas Rhett's Life Changes were the other nominees in the Best Country Album category. The win gives Stapleton five lifetime Grammys, all after his 2015 breakout at the CMA Awards when he performed \"Tennessee Whiskey\" with Justin Timberlake.\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find a better professional 24 hours for a singer. On Saturday night Stapleton performed two songs on Saturday Night Live. Next Friday his new song with Timberlake will be included on the pop star's new album.", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Chris-Stapleton.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Chris-Stapleton.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Billy Dukes"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/chris-stapletons-best-country-album-grammy-gives-him-three/", "title": "Chris Stapleton\u2019s Best Country Album Grammy Gives Him Three", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "Chris Stapleton won every Grammy Award he could have won on Sunday, finishing with the Best Country Album award.", "keywords": "best country album grammy, best country album, chris stapleton grammy, from a room vol. 1, country music grammy awards", "fb": {"app_id": 193351250697247, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 173910492638623}, "og": {"title": "Chris Stapleton's Best Country Album Grammy Gives Him Three", "description": "Chris Stapleton won every Grammy Award he could have won on Sunday, finishing with the Best Country Album award.", "url": "https://tasteofcountry.com/chris-stapletons-best-country-album-grammy-gives-him-three/", "site_name": "Taste of Country", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Chris-Stapleton.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tasteofcountry"}, "sailthru.description": "Chris Stapleton won every Grammy Award he could have won on Sunday, finishing with the Best Country Album award.", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-28 22:09:00", "sailthru.title": "Chris Stapleton\u2019s Best Country Album Grammy Gives Him Three", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, chris-stapleton, country-music-news, grammys", "sailthru.author": "billydukesgmail-com", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Chris-Stapleton.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Chris-Stapleton.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "e19BTQtucrkVk-O5axdlPIIJWMrqGU-QRWcldJZvxnA", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517148540.0, "source": "http://tasteofcountry.com", "summary": ""}
