The two-hour Thursday, January 5, ABC special, entitled Truth And Lies: The Menendez Brothers, revisited the double homicide and featured an interview with Lyle as he serves his two life sentences in Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California.\n\nWatch Us Weekly Video\u2019s recap above, and read on for seven revelations from the chilling program.\n\nLyle and Erik Robbed Houses in Calabasas\n\nThe murders of Kitty and Jose Menendez were not Lyle and Erik\u2019s first brush with crime. When the affluent Menendez family moved to Los Angeles in 1987, they initially settled in Calabasas. Karen Ferrell, a close friend of the late Kitty, pointed out houses in the neighborhood, even saying, \u201cBruce Jenner \u2014 when he was Bruce Jenner \u2014 had a house here.\u201d Karen then continued, saying of the brothers, \u201cThey were bored.\u2026 Robbing houses was a challenge.\u2026 They didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be caught.\u201d\n\nTheir father, the late Jose, a wealthy Hollywood producer at the time, attempted to smooth things over by visiting each house and writing the victims a check in the amount equal to the value of what was stolen. Their neighbor Alicia Hercz told the camera, \u201cThe main message was, \u2018How stupid of you to get caught.'\u201d According to Craig Cignarelli, a former friend of Erik\u2019s, after getting caught stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and other items, \u201cThey both got probation\u2026 moved down to Beverly Hills.\u201d\n\nErik\u2019s Modeling Photographer Read His Screenplay About Murdering His Parents\n\nCignarelli admitted to the camera about Erik, \u201cWe wrote a screenplay. We wrote several screenplays.\u201d Photographer Philip Kearney, known for taking the infamous shirtless modeling photos of Erik, was a recipient of the script, saying it was \u201cabout the boy who kills his parents to collect the insurance.\u201d Cignarelli clarified the plot point, saying, \u201cWe needed the characters to get money somehow \u2026\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAs time went by, Erik took that screenplay and reworded the first four or five pages to exactly what happened in the crime.\u201d When Kearney turned on the news the morning after the murder, he recalled feeling a \u201cchilling realization.\u201d Kearney recalled the famous underwear photoshoot with Erik, saying, \u201cThe last photo shoot was a little bit different.\u2026 He was a quieter.\u2026 A little more humble.\u2026 Those pictures to me look a little more haunting.\u201d\n\nKitty Admitted in Front of Erik That She Was Taking Him Out of Her Will\n\nKitty\u2019s friend Karen Ferrell then recalled a moment between Kitty and Erik. Kitty was at the family computer updating her will and speaking openly to Karen about it. Karen recalled mentioning to Kitty that Erik was listening in the other room: \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t care. They know I\u2019m not gonna give them any money.'\u201d (The family estate was worth 14 million at the time of her murder.) Kitty\u2019s brother Brian Anderson revealed to the camera that Kitty was worried about her children, saying, \u201cShe was really concerned about the irresponsibility.\u2026 Lyle was stressing her a lot.\u201d\n\nLyle and Erik Shot Their Parents to Death, Then Went Shopping for Rolexes Weeks Later\n\nLyle and Erik\u2019s bizarre post-murder behavior was one of the reasons they were eventually convicted of murder in the first degree. Beverly Hills Detective Leslie Zoeller recalled of the brutal murder scene on August 20, 1989, \u201cKitty was wearing white, she was covered in blood.\u2026 There was brain matter on the ceiling, on the windows. It was really horrendous.\u201d In a clip from a 1996 interview with Barbara Walters, Erik recalled, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an alibi \u2014 we just said we were at the movies.\u201d\n\nFive weeks after the murder, Erik and Lyle received $400,000 in life insurance money and decided to go on a spending spree. ABC journalist Terry Moran recalled, \u201cThey were having a grand ol\u2019 time spending the money of a dead man.\u201d They bought Rolexes, a Porsche and even took the time to invest some of the money in a friend\u2019s business before their eventual arrest.\n\nErik and Lyle\u2019s Abuse Claims\n\nThe crux of Lyle and Erik\u2019s 1993 trial hinged on testimony that the two of them were allegedly abused by their parents. Prosecutor Pam Bozanich recalled about Erik\u2019s lawyer, Leslie Abramson, \u201cEveryone told me, \u2018Watch out for her. She will lie, cheat and steal.\u201d Pam continued, \u201cThe whole \u2018abuse excuse\u2019 is a lie.\u201d\n\nHowever, journalist Moran backed Erik and Lyle\u2019s abuse claims. Moran explained of their gruesome abuse testimony, \u201cThere was a level of detail.\u2026 There are things that people remember from real life that you almost wouldn\u2019t kind of make up.\u201d He recalled noticing Erik\u2019s reaction to Lyle\u2019s testimony of his father molesting him and said, \u201cI saw this vein start popping out of his forehead\u2026 that emotion. That\u2019s what a victim looks like.\u201d\n\nMoran also noted that several family members testified to the abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain that away,\u201d said Moran. He later told the camera, \u201cIf the Menendez brothers were the Menedez sisters, they would be free today. We don\u2019t wanna think that boys get raped by their fathers.\u201d\n\nKitty\u2019s brother, on the other hand, did not believe the abuse claims at all: \u201cThere was certainly no indication at any time that there was ever any abuse.\u2026 I mean it just didn\u2019t happen.\u2026 I think the motive was strictly money.\u201d He later said, \u201cThe idea that Erik and Lyle were abused by my sister Kitty was gratuitous.\u201d\n\nErik and Lyle Both Got Married While Serving Life Sentences\n\nEventually, the Menendez case resulted in a mistrial, causing the whole process to start all over again. The second trial went much more quickly, and a verdict came in July 1996, which followed the October 1995 decision in the similarly captivating O.J. Simpson case. Terry Moran remembered, \u201cWhen O.J. Simpson was acquitted \u2026 it brought tremendous law-and-order pressure on jurors across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nThey were quickly sentenced to murder in the first degree and are both serving consecutive life sentences in separate prisons. Lyle and Erik, now 48 and 45 years old respectively, both tied the knot while behind bars. Erik is married to Tammi Menendez, who \u2014 in a 2002 interview with Barbara Walters \u2014 revealed, \u201cI fell in love with him unexpectedly.\u2026 And now I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\nLyle has been married twice and spoke out about his current relationship with wife Rebecca Sneed, saying, \u201cPhysical comfort is much less important than your connection with the people around you,\u2026 We\u2019ve been married 15 years.\u201d Lyle then called it a \u201chealthy marriage.\u201d\n\nLyle: \u201cIt Could Have So Easily Not Have Happened\u201d\n\nThe most fascinating part of the documentary may have been when Lyle spoke publicly about his life behind bars. Reflecting on the past, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not living in the reality of what has occurred.\u2026 You\u2019re living like a ghost among people that are alive. You\u2019re just adrift.\u201d He spoke about his life now, saying he has a \u201chigh level of stress.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cMy own childhood prepared me surprisingly well for the chaos of prison life.\u2026 You feel that loss of freedom deeply.\u201d About murdering both of his parents, he stated, \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to think about that that happened.\u2026 It\u2019s still jarring. Like, it seems so far removed from who I am and who I was \u2026\u201d He went on to call his life \u201ca failed, destructive ending.\u2026 It could have so easily not have happened.\u201d\n\nThe documentary ended after revealing that Lyle and Erik haven\u2019t seen each other since 1996.\n\nTell Us: What did you think of Lyle\u2019s comments?\n\nTruth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers airs on ABC Thursday, January 5, at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lyle-inset-5ae73df9-fba9-4cb1-aefd-f1e04e16fbbc.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lyle-8ad3c55f-c32e-4abc-8ef9-05ef9ce80bf4.jpg?crop=1px%2C16px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lyle-8ad3c55f-c32e-4abc-8ef9-05ef9ce80bf4.jpg?crop=1px%2C16px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cait Raft"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lyle-menendez-opens-up-after-killing-parents-7-revelations-w459143/", "title": "Lyle Menendez Opens Up After Killing Parents: 7 Revelations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Lyle Menendez spoke out on 'Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers,' nearly 27 years after he and brother Erik murdered their parents \u2014 here are seven revelations from the Thursday, January 5, ABC special", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lyle Menendez Speaks Out After Killing Parents: 7 Biggest Revelations", "description": "Lyle Menendez spoke out on 'Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers,' nearly 27 years after he and brother Erik murdered their parents \u2014 here are seven revelations from the Thursday, January 5, ABC special", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lyle-menendez-opens-up-after-killing-parents-7-revelations-w459143/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:17:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lyle-8ad3c55f-c32e-4abc-8ef9-05ef9ce80bf4.jpg?crop=1px%2C16px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lyle-8ad3c55f-c32e-4abc-8ef9-05ef9ce80bf4.jpg?crop=1px%2C16px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-01-06T09:40:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:17:03+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lyle Menendez spoke out on 'Truth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers,' nearly 27 years after he and brother Erik murdered their parents \u2014 here are seven revelations from the Thursday, January 5, ABC special", "title": "Lyle Menendez Speaks Out After Killing Parents: 7 Biggest Revelations", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lyle-8ad3c55f-c32e-4abc-8ef9-05ef9ce80bf4.jpg?crop=1px%2C16px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1483695600.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
