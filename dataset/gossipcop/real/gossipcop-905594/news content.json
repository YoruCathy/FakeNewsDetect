I think it's a good thing and I support it.\"\n\nColbert asked Franco if it's possible for there to be reconciliation between his thoughts about what happened and the accusations leveled against him.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

I have to.\"\n\nOn a night when he won a best actor award for his role in \"The Disaster Artist,\" the 39-year-old was called out on Twitter by actresses Violet Paley and Sarah Tither-Kaplan for what they described as sexually inappropriate and exploitative behavior.\n\nAlly Sheedy, the \"Breakfast Club\" star who acted in a 2014 Off-Broadway play directed by Franco, also made cryptic references to Franco on Twitter during the Golden Globes.\n\n\"James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business,\" she wrote in a tweet that has since been deleted.\n\nIn another tweet, the actress wrote, \"Why is James Franco allowed in?\"\n\nFranco told Colbert, \"I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy.\"\n\n\"I had nothing but a great time with her. I have total respect for her,\" he added. \"I have no idea why she was upset. She took the tweet down. I can\u2019t speak for her.\"\n\nFranco also reasserted his reason for wearing the pin representing the Time's Up movement in which more than 300 actresses initially donated more than $13 million to a legal defense fund that supports men and women who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\"I wore (the pin) because I do support it,'' Franco said. \"I support change.\"\n\nFollow
