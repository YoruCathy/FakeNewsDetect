The rapper also left the state of New York without getting permission from the court.\n\nA representative for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office said since his arrest for tax evasion, the rapper tested positive for cocaine not once, but four times, and was caught with marijuana in his system twice.\n\nThe representative added DMX claimed he could be drug-free on his own after the government offered him to take drug addiction counseling.\n\nAlso, in July, authorities contacted the rapper, and he told them he was in Chicago.\n\nNot long after, he traveled to St. Louis to deal with a \u201cfamily emergency.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, for the rapper, this trip to St. Louis might leave him with jail-time, as leaving the state when the government tells you not to is a big no-no.\n\nAs CI readers know, he was charged with tax evasion and fraud and could be convicted for more than 40 years if he\u2019s hit with all the counts.\n\nThe rapper has not come out to comment publicly.\n\nAccording to reports, he is, suspected of, \u201cengaging in a multi-year scheme to conceal millions of dollars of income from the IRS and to avoid paying $1,7 million of tax liabilities.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney, Joon H. Kim said in his declaration, that while DMX was making millions of dollars as an artist, actor, and entrepreneur, he was deliberately going out of his way to avoid taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut while raking in millions from his songs, DMX didn\u2019t give any of it to the IRS. Far from it, DMX allegedly went out of his way to evade taxes, including by avoiding personal bank accounts, setting up accounts in other\u2019s names and paying personal expenses largely in cash.\u201d It looks like the rapper is in serious trouble, as deliberately avoiding taxes is a serious crime in almost every developed nation.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amber-And-Elon--700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DMX.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DMX-NBCNews.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Chris-Brown-DMX-Challenge-Nicki-Minaj-Halle-Berry-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GQ_OO_S05_EP182_ICONIC_TRACKS_DMX_081319_TEXTLESS.00_01_09_18.Still008-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/DMX.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/dmx-on-house-arrest-after-violating-bail-conditions-58706/", "title": "DMX On House Arrest After Violating Bail Conditions!", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "DMX,", "keywords": "celebrity news, DMX,", "description": "A judge has ordered DMX to be on house arrest with an ankle monitor after he violated the conditions of his bail by failing drug tests.
