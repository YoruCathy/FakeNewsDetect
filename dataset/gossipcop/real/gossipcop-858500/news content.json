I'm not going to spend hours photo shopping my authenticity away. I'm not going to beat myself up for not looking like someone else. I'm not going to be told that I'm damaged goods because of my tattoos.\"\n\n\"Most days I'm self-conscious, but today I love every curve and edge,\" she added. \"Your body should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves.\"\n\nBaldwin continued on, telling her fans she hopes to \"be as real as possible\" with everyone who follows her.\n\n\"To be quite honest, what is even the point of social media if you can't be who you truly are?\" she asked. \"I'm not here to mindf**k all of you into believing I am something that I'm not. I'm forever on a journey of finding my better self and I will continue to work as hard as I can to make MYSELF proud. Today I hope everyone is proud of who they are and can recognize what they can accomplish!\"\n\nDo you, girl!\n\n\n\nWATCH: Ireland Baldwin Goes Topless in 'Love' Advent Calendar Video", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-06/set_ireland_baldwin_bikini_insta.jpg?itok=wClMebnn", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/set_ireland_baldwin_bikini_insta.jpg?itok=CdqYoAD8", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/set_ireland_baldwin_bikini_insta.jpg?itok=CdqYoAD8", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/218822_ireland_baldwin_claps_back_at_body_shamers", "title": "Ireland Baldwin Claps Back at Body Shamers: 'This Is Who I Am'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Ireland Baldwin Claps Back at Body Shamers: 'This Is Who I Am' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/218822_ireland_baldwin_claps_back_at_body_shamers", "title": "Ireland Baldwin Claps Back at Body Shamers: 'This Is Who I Am'", "description": "The 21-year-old daughter of Alec Baldwin is encouraging her followers to treat their bodies with 'dignity and respect.'", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/set_ireland_baldwin_bikini_insta.jpg?itok=CdqYoAD8", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 21-year-old daughter of Alec Baldwin is encouraging her followers to treat their bodies with 'dignity and respect.'", "title": "Ireland Baldwin Claps Back at Body Shamers: 'This Is Who I Am'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Desiree Murphy", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/218822_ireland_baldwin_claps_back_at_body_shamers", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/set_ireland_baldwin_bikini_insta.jpg?itok=CdqYoAD8"}, "description": "The 21-year-old daughter of Alec Baldwin is encouraging her followers to treat their bodies with 'dignity and respect.'", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
