Given the platform's struggle to attract new users in recent years, Twitter is likely hoping this move will help it overcome sluggish growth up its daily user count from the current 330 million.\n\nBanishing brevity\n\nOne of the initial criticisms leveled at Twitter was that longer posts would ruin the user experience. However, in a blog post published on Tuesday (7 November) the company was quick to assuage its community, saying that only 5% of tweets sent by users selected for testing were longer than 140 characters and that just 2% were over 190 characters.\n\nAliza Rosen, product manager at Twitter said: \"We \u2013 and many of you \u2013 were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that didn\u2019t happen... for reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.\"\n\nWhen the trial initially launched, many users who had been gifted the extra characters used them to poke fun at the whole concept by way of much wordier messages. In the announcement today Twitter said this was because the function was \"new and novel\" and that this creative behaviour \"normalised\" soon after.\n\nSince returning as chief executive in 2016, Jack Dorsey has made several major changes to Twitter. Earlier this year, the firm announced it would stop counting photos and links as part of the 140-character limit.", "images": ["https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/logo/drum-logo-grey.png", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/icons/crown-small.png", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-messenger-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/company/icon-newsletter.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-twitter-white.svg", "https://images.bibblio.org/logos/bibblio/positive-w90.png", "https://media-assets-05.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-news-tmp-90538-twitter-gty-02-jrl-170926_12x5_992--default--992.jpg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-rss-white.svg", "https://static-thedrum.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets/images/static/devices.png", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-whatsapp-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-youtube-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/logo/logo-thedrum-mobile.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/company/icon-subscribe.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-flipboard-white-new.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-instagram-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-linkedin-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/logo/logo-thedrum-desktop.png", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-pinterest-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-facebook-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/dtf/svg/clock-face.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/logo/logo-thedrum-mobile.png", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-email-white.svg", "https://www.thedrum.com/assets/images/social/icons/icon-social-reddit.svg"], "top_img": "https://media-assets-05.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-news-tmp-90538-twitter-gty-02-jrl-170926_12x5_992--default--992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/11/07/twitter-officially-doubles-the-character-limit-280-all-users", "title": "Twitter officially doubles the character limit to 280 for all users", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/11/07/twitter-officially-doubles-the-character-limit-280-all-users", "site_name": "The Drum", "description": "Twitter is officially doubling its character limit from 140 to 280, with the change set to roll out globally in the next few days.", "image": "https://media-assets-05.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-news-tmp-90538-twitter-gty-02-jrl-170926_12x5_992--default--992.jpg", "title": "Twitter officially doubles the character limit to 280 for all users", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thedrum", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bereccastewart", "description": "Twitter is officially doubling its character limit from 140 to 280, with the change set to roll out globally in the next few days.", "image": "https://media-assets-05.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-news-tmp-90538-twitter-gty-02-jrl-170926_12x5_992--default--992.jpg", "title": "Twitter officially doubles the character limit to 280 for all users"}, "description": "Twitter is officially doubling its character limit from 140 to 280, with the change set to roll out globally in the next few days.", "keywords": "Twitter, Social Media Marketing", "robots": "NOODP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#000000", "msvalidate.01": "6DA512FE73075919C8F1633A7A6738B2", "fb": {"pages": 246394715021}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509984000.0, "source": "https://www.thedrum.com", "summary": ""}
