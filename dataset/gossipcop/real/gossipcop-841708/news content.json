Scarlett Johansson stepped out with her estranged husband, Romain Dauriac, on Wednesday, April 5, weeks after filing for divorce.\n\nThe Avengers: Infinity War actress, 32, and Dauriac attended the \u201cSingular Object\u201d opening cocktail reception at 53W53 Gallery in NYC. They posed for photos together, with Johansson noticeably not wearing her wedding ring.\n\nThe pair first went public with their relationship in November 2012 and are the parents of daughter Rose, 2. Us Weekly confirmed in January that Johansson and the French journalist were ending their two-year marriage. She filed for divorce on March 8.\n\n\u201cAs a devoted mother and private person and with complete awareness that my daughter will one day be old enough to read the news about herself, I would only like to say that I will never, ever be commenting on the dissolution of my marriage,\u201d Johansson told Us in a statement at the time. \u201cOut of respect for my desires as a parent and out of respect for all working moms, it is with kindness that I ask other parties involved and the media to do the same. Thank you.\u201d\n\nDauriac\u2019s attorney, Harold Mayerson, told Page Six that both parties would be fighting over custody of their daughter. \u201cHe would like to move to France with his daughter, and Ms. Johansson does a lot of traveling,\u201d Mayerson said. \u201cIt will be an interesting process.\u201d\n\nDauriac also issued a statement to Us via Mayerson. \u201cIt is indeed unfortunate, especially for our daughter, that Scarlett filed in court and made our personal differences so public,\u201d the statement read. \u201cI would implore her to withdraw her action promptly and to go back, as uncomfortable as it might be, to the negotiating table. We are the parents of a lovely daughter whom we will continue to coparent for many years and share her joys and sorrows as only a parent can.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/scarlett-johansson-romaine-duriac-a05dc859-80b7-409e-93ae-f5db433c1da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1362px%2C715px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/scarlett-johansson-romaine-duriac-a05dc859-80b7-409e-93ae-f5db433c1da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C52px%2C1362px%2C765px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/scarlett-johansson-romaine-duriac-a05dc859-80b7-409e-93ae-f5db433c1da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1362px%2C715px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scarlett-johansson-reunites-with-ex-romain-dauriac-after-divorce-filing-w475332/", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Reunites With Ex Romain Dauriac After Divorce Filing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Scarlett Johansson attended an art opening with her estranged husband, Romain Dauriac, after filing for divorce \u2014 see the photo", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Attends Event With Ex Romain Dauriac Amid Divorce", "description": "Scarlett Johansson attended an art opening with her estranged husband, Romain Dauriac, after filing for divorce \u2014 see the photo", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scarlett-johansson-reunites-with-ex-romain-dauriac-after-divorce-filing-w475332/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:19:47+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/scarlett-johansson-romaine-duriac-a05dc859-80b7-409e-93ae-f5db433c1da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1362px%2C715px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/scarlett-johansson-romaine-duriac-a05dc859-80b7-409e-93ae-f5db433c1da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1362px%2C715px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-06T12:46:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:19:47+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Scarlett Johansson attended an art opening with her estranged husband, Romain Dauriac, after filing for divorce \u2014 see the photo", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Attends Event With Ex Romain Dauriac Amid Divorce", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/scarlett-johansson-romaine-duriac-a05dc859-80b7-409e-93ae-f5db433c1da0.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1362px%2C715px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491482760.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
