(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\n\n\nOn a night when diversity and inclusion were celebrated throughout the ceremony, there was a good sense of equality in the distribution of the rest of the awards. \u201cDunkirk\u201d won three Oscars, while \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d picked up two, with best actress and best supporting actor going to Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell.\n\nRELATED: Oscars 2018 red carpet fashion: See photos of the stars\u2019 best and worst looks\n\n\u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d \u201cCoco\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner\u201d each won twice, with Gary Oldman\u2019s turn as Winston Churchill in \u201cThe Darkest Hour\u201d earning him best actor. No other film won more than once.\n\nMcDormand\u2019s win for best actress was an outcome that, like that for the three acting winners who preceded her on Sunday, was widely expected. Her speech, however, was anything but routine.\n\n\u201cIf I fall over pick me up, because I\u2019ve got some things to say,\u201d McDormand said with a take-no-nonsense stare into the camera.\n\nRELATED: Complete winners at the 90th Annual Academy Awards\n\n\u201cAnd now I want to get some perspective,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf I may be so honored to have every female nominee stand with me in this room. The actors, the directors, the writers. OK, look around everybody, because we all have stories to tell, and projects we need financed.\u201d\n\nOldman, who had won most of the best actor honors leading up to the Academy Awards, added that final prize to his collection on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in America for the longest time, and I am deeply grateful to her for the love and the friendships I have made, and the many wonderful gifts it has given me,\u201d Oldman said. \u201cMy home, my livelihood, my family, and now Oscar.\u201d\n\nAccepting the Oscar for best director, Del Toro hit one of the recurrent themes of the night: the need to open doors, not close them.\n\n\u201cThe greatest thing our art does and our industry does is erase the lines in the sand,\u201d Del Toro said in accepting the Oscar. \u201cWe should continue to do that when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Oscars 2018: These 5 moments made history at the 90th Academy Awards\n\nHistory was made by both screenwriters, James Ivory and Jordan Peele, who won Oscars on Sunday.\n\nIvory, who won best adapted screenplay for \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d not only took home his first Academy Award after more than six decades in the film business, by doing so at the age of 89 he became the oldest-ever winner of an Oscar in any category.\n\nAnd Peele, who won for original screenplay for writing \u201cGet Out,\u201d became the first black writer to ever win that category.\n\n\u201cCoco,\u201d the Day of the Dead-inspired film from Pixar and Disney, won as expected for best animated film, its Mexican roots giving its creators a chance to speak out to celebrate diversity and champion equality for all.\n\n\u201c\u2019Coco\u2019 is proof that art can change and connect the world, and this can only be done when we have a place for everyone and anyone who feels like an \u2018other\u2019 to be heard,\u201d said Darla K. Anderson.\n\nRELATED: The 2018 Oscars as told by these GIFs\n\nFormer Los Angeles Laker superstar Kobe Bryant added an Oscar to his five NBA championship rings when \u201cDear Basketball,\u201d the film based on a letter he wrote in 2015 when he announced his retirement from the game, won the Academy Award for best short animated film.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message for all of us,\u201d said Glen Keane, who directed the film and shared the Academy Award with Bryant. \u201cWhatever form your dream may take, it\u2019s through passion and perseverance that the impossible is possible.\u201d\n\nAdded Bryant, with a subtle commentary on a recent dispute between a Fox News host and NBA star LeBron James: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible. I mean, as basketball players we\u2019re really supposed to shut up and dribble, but I\u2019m glad we do a little bit more than that.\u201d\n\nAllison Janney and Sam Rockwell, who won for supporting actress and supporting actor, had been front runners throughout the awards season, though of course you never know for sure until you hear your name read.\n\n\u201cI did it all by myself,\u201d Janney joked of her role as LaVona, the abusive and not at all very nice mother of skater Tonya Harding in \u201cI, Tonya.\u201d \u201cOK, nothing further from the truth.\u201d\n\nRockwell took home the first Oscar of the night, winning best supporting actor as most expected he would for his role as a racist police officer who slowly sees the error of his ways in \u201cThree Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d\n\nRockwell sat his shiny statue on the stage at the Dolby Theatre and thanked, among others, his parents for instilling in him a love of movies from a very young age, recounting how one day in elementary school he was called to the principal\u2019s office where his father was waiting.\n\n\u201cMy father was looking very solemn, and he said, \u2018You gotta go, it\u2019s grandma,\u2019\u201d Rockwell said.\u201dI got in the car and said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with grandma?\u2019 He said, \u2018Nothing, we\u2019re going to to the movies.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter thanking everyone involved in making \u201cThree Billboards\u201d \u2013 and \u201ceveryone who\u2019s ever looked at a billboard\u201d \u2013 Rockwell left the stage, clocking out after a minute and 29 seconds, as host Jimmy Kimmel noted, part of bit he announced in his monologue in which he promised a Jet-Ski to the winner who gave the shortest speech.\n\nIn his opening, Kimmel touched on all the topics you\u2019d expect \u2013 sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement, President Donald Trump, and the unprecedented screw-up at the Academy Awards a year ago when the wrong movie was announced as the winner of best picture.\n\n\u201cI do want to mention: This year, when you hear your name called, don\u2019t get up right away,\u201d Kimmel said in reference to the announcement that \u201cLa La Land\u201d had won instead of actual winner \u201cMoonlight.\u201d \u201cGive us a minute.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Oscars 2018: Rita Moreno is a national treasure at the 90th Academy Awards\n\nReferencing the sexual harassment scandals that have engulfed Hollywood, politics, business and pretty much everyone corner of society in the past year, Kimmel paid tribute to the man-sized Oscar statue on stage as the perfect man.\n\n\u201cHe keeps his hands where you can see them,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cNever says a rude word. And most importantly no penis at all.
