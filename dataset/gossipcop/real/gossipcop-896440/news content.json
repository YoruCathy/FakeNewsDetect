Oh, yeah, it\u2019s another episode of Total Divas. Tonight is hopefully the conclusion of last week\u2019s \u201cgirls\u2019 vacation\u201d in Tahoe. I\u2019m eating pizza rolls (combination flavor) and drinking Cherry Coke as I type this because I just got home from work\u2026 in case someone thought I would be eating something organic and drinking tea. Based on the show open, the women will be wearing bikinis at multiple points, Paige will be sunburned, and I will inevitably yell at Lana on my TV for apologizing for who the hell knows what. Oh, and I\u2019m sure that Nattie will lie about something, because she\u2019s on the episode and that\u2019s kind of her thing.\n\nThe show opens with Naomi and Jimmy Uso. Naomi wants a place in Atlanta. Ah, yes, relationships are about compromise. Meanwhile in Tahoe all the girls eat lunch. At this table, Paige is already sunburned. Oh, goodie, Nikki Bella is being challenged to write a poem about commitment. Yeah, I just typed that. Supposedly Nikki has been writing \u201cpoetry\u201d since she was a teen \u2013 which I\u2019m willing to believe. What I don\u2019t believe is that she ever studied poetry or linguistics or has even the faintest idea that there is actually such a thing as a \u201crhyming dictionary\u201d \u2013 let alone that she\u2019s actually read much from a real dictionary \u2013 because I\u2019ve seen her speak on television and I saw the IQ episode where she proved to be of average intelligence. So, this should be fantastically cringy!\n\nNow, back to the episode; Nia is afraid of not fitting in. And then Brie Bella is afraid of Tahoe Tessie. Tahoe Tessie is an American knock-off of the Loch Ness Monster just like the Book of Mormon is an American version of the Bible. Lana is afraid of failing, and also being an outsider. Nattie wants Lana to do a trust fall. \u201cNo, Lana, no!\u201d I say to the TV while eating a Hostess cherry pie. Oh yeah, I\u2019m going for all the shades of unhealthy tonight. Anyway, Lana does the trust fall and they catch her.\n\nNow everyone\u2019s on a boat in bathing suits (15 minutes, men) and Brie is talking about Tahoe Tessie again. The girls are going to parasail. Oh, and Naomi arrives on a boat. Nattie and Naomi parasail. That lasted for all of two minutes. Back at the house, Nia is journaling and then chats with Paige about Paige\u2019s inability to swim. Again, people are gathered around a table. Oh, Brie is going to cry about being away from her baby. Yeah, this is a first world problem that most people don\u2019t experience. Also, I just started scrolling through my Instagram timeline because that\u2019s how uninteresting I find Brie Bella. Commercial.\n\nOh, there\u2019s a teaser for the upcoming season of Total Bellas, or as I know it: \u201cWhy the f\u2014 is this show still on the air?\u201d Brie is going to set Nikki up on a date with some guy from some other reality TV show, because, I presume, the producers of E! were, like, \u201cShit, there\u2019s a giant hole in this show without the f\u2014ing weirdo that is John Cena.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they have a museum on Tahoe Tessie, that means it\u2019s real,\u201d says Brie Bella. Teenage girls, I implore you to get better role models, seriously. Also, read a book! \u201cI think Brie\u2019s fear of Tahoe Tessie is fricking hilarious,\u201d says Naomi. Yes, Naomi, that is correct. For shits and giggles, there\u2019s a lot of random footage of streets, sunsets, etc. in Total Divas, so, 28 minutes in there\u2019s a shot of a chipmunk. Ironically, I worked on an illustration of a chipmunk last night.\n\nOh crap, Nikki Bella has \u201cbooks\u201d of poetry that she\u2019s written. Also, she apparently can\u2019t write poetry on command, which, hey teenage girls, is a life lesson: Someone with a vested interest in a trade (whether it be writing, fashion, design, photography, etc.) actually studies the trade, reads books, learns from examples of those who are masters, and then is proficient in applicable situations. For instance, no one that I graduated from art school with is incapable of doing their craft on command. There\u2019s a difference between having a play hobby and being skilled. There\u2019s a real god damned slim chance I\u2019m going to be impressed by the \u201cpoetry\u201d I\u2019m going to hear at the end of this episode\u2026 because, again, I\u2019ve seen the IQ episode.\n\nAnyway, the girls are on a boat and they\u2019re going to go tubing. Hopefully someone has slathered Paige with sunscreen. First world problems: Can Paige hold on to an inflatable tube while wearing a life jacket in a lake. Paige falls off, of course, and then once she\u2019s back on the boat she cries. Imma try and pretend I didn\u2019t sit here in my living room eating mini Reese\u2019s cups and laughing at a grown woman crying about falling off an innertube in a lake while wearing a life jacket while on a vacation while staying at a rented mansion.\n\nBack from commercial, it\u2019s another everyone-at-a-table-eating-food moment. So, everyone is talking about Lana before Lana shows up at the table. Yeah, girls, that\u2019s called gossiping. Yeah, okay, that resolved nothing. Naomi and Nia decide to cook. It apparently wasn\u2019t fabulous, and yet people were able to make jokes about it who participated in it while it was happening\u2026 unlike that time when Nikki Bella made John Cena dinner instead of going out to dinner and he said nothing about the food and was just worried about whether or not his idiot girlfriend damaged anything in his fancy mansion. I might be high on refined sugar, but I haven\u2019t forgotten. Anyway, Brie tries to scare everyone with a squid mask as if she\u2019s Tahoe Tessie. Nikki ordered pizza. So, Naomi\u2019s biggest fear is divorce. Yes, leave it to Naomi to be the adult, think of the adult problem, and then probably be pragmatic and responsible about it.\n\nNaomi has brought the gravity to the situation. She\u2019s the adultiest adult on this show. Later on, outside, the girls sit around a campfire, and they burn some tiny little wood logs. I will note that I don\u2019t think that Nattie has admitted to being afraid of something. Oh, shit, 50 minutes into this show and Nikki Bella is reading her poem, and from the first sentence this is positively written at a teenage girl writing level, and I don\u2019t mean like a hipster library nerd who reads books teenage girl. SMH. Also, the poem doesn\u2019t rhyme\u2026 until it tries to rhyme. Oh, lordy. There are hugs after the poem. Uh-huh. I\u2019m now on my second glass of Cherry Coke. Paige then reads from her journal, followed by Nia (who says nice things), Lana begins reading from her journal \u2013 talks about apologies and cries \u2013 and commercial!\n\nSo, Lana is talking about words, and she wants to leave a legacy of \u201clove and forgiveness.\u201d Yeah, this is cheesy. Then everyone is on a dock \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 eating, talking about having a baby. Nattie admits that she wants to \u201chave a baby at some point.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that. Anyway, everyone jumps off the dock and into the lake with their clothes on. Paige wears a life jacket. They speak of sisterhood and magic and cleansing. And then everyone ends up in a hot tub for three seconds of screen time.\n\nOn the season finale of Total Divas, it\u2019ll be about the Money in the Bank match, Naomi losing her wedding ring, and the death of Nattie\u2019s father, Jim \u201cthe Anvil\u201d Neidhart.\n\nNOW CHECK OUT LAST WEEK\u2019S REPORT: 11/7 TOTAL DIVAS REVIEW: Girls in Bikinis on the Lake episode includes bickering over who has better room, Paige empowering internet jerks, Nikki insists on mandatory journaling time", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/09/TotalDivas_2018_3x2_600.png?resize=600%2C381&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2019/01/PWTorchDailyCast2019_MMATalk.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2017/12/WadeKellerHotline2017.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2019/08/SmackdownFox_WWELogo2019_600.png?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PWTorchLogo2016-text580tight.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2020/04/TotalBellas2000_3x2_600.png?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f6c6ab59a75b01d0c90e3e3d0f50a527?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/03/WWE-logo-3x2_600.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2020/03/BruceMitchellVIPMailbagPodcast2020.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/06/OnTheCanvas.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c3ced3d59dc5a784592d6d34618f1913?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2019/01/WKPWP_Blue_Spreaker.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e9acec66fedeb47b97425ce64f02a5d?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c496dd1e57a7221d62f20a33aabe0547?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2020/03/TorchCover597_3x2_600.png?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-includes/images/rss.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/09/TotalDivas_2018_3x2_600.png?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6a5cae733130bf865df2a9c0f535838d?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2017/12/TheFix2017V.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5627aa75cccfa0945b4f462bb4ebc681?s=24&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/09/TotalDivas_2018_3x2_600.png?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bob Rimpnerton", "Kevin", "Truckmonth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/11/15/11-14-total-divas-review-nia-jax-is-afraid-of-not-fitting-in-nikki-the-poet-naomi-and-nia-cook-paige-cant-swim-and-gets-sunburn-lana-subject-of-gossip/", "title": "11/14 TOTAL DIVAS REVIEW: Nia Jax is afraid of not fitting in, Nikki the Poet, Naomi and Nia cook, Paige can't swim and gets sunburn, Lana subject of gossip -", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "11/14 TOTAL DIVAS REVIEW: Nia Jax is afraid of not fitting in, Nikki the Poet, Naomi and Nia cook, Paige can't swim and gets sunburn, Lana subject of gossip -", "description": "TOTAL DIVAS \u2013 EPISODE 9 NOVEMBER 14, 2018 AIRED ON E!
