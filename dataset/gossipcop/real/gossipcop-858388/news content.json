Below, pop music icon Britney Spears shares her handwritten note. Read more Pride Month love letters here.\n\nThis is my letter of love to all my LGBTQ fans. Continuously throughout my career, you've always been so vocal about what a positive impact I've had on you -- that I've instilled joy, hope and love in you at times when there was none. That my music is an inspiration. That my story gives you hope.\n\nBut I have a secret to share with you. You see, it's actually you that lifts me up. The unwavering loyalty. the lack of judgment. The unapologetic truth. Acceptance! Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy and make me and my sons strive to be better people.\n\nI love you.\n\nBritney", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/billboard-pride-2017-recirc.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Britney-Spears-Love-Letter-Pride-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?5483f7d85ab28d1d2c44"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Britney-Spears-Love-Letter-Pride-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Britney Spears"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/7809846/britney-spears-gay-pride-month-love-letter", "title": "Britney Spears: Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-06-28T17:06:05-04:00", "published_time": "2017-06-01T12:06:00-04:00"}, "description": "For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community.", "og": {"description": "For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Britney-Spears-Love-Letter-Pride-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Britney Spears: Gay Pride Month Handwritten Love Letter (Exclusive) | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/7809846/britney-spears-gay-pride-month-love-letter", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Britney Spears: Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Britney-Spears-Love-Letter-Pride-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Britney Spears: Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496333160.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
