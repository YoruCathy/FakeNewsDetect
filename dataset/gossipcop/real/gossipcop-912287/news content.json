While the end of the show made our hearts break (and we'd be lying if we said we're over it), this sweet reunion between the two responsible for our heartbreak is a step in the right direction.\n\nRead more: A live-action \u2018Kim Possible\u2019 movie is in the works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those of you who didn't obsessively watch the show (we can't imagine why), the show followed the lives of the Diffy family, a futuristic family from the year 2121 who got stuck in the year 2004 after their time machine broke during a family vaction.\n\nDuring their time in 2004, Phil meets his best friend, Keely, and let's just say we shipped them before we even knew shipping was a thing. To make a long story short, the show ended with the two confessing their feelings for one another and Phil going back to the future, which completely broke our hearts.\n\n^The moment our hearts swooned and broke at the same time^\n\nWhile we're still not over the fact that these two didn't get a happy ending, Aly Michalka and Raviv Ullman made up for our childhood heartbreak by giving us this sweet reunion\u2026\n\nUllman posted the moment onto his Instagram, which made our Disney Channel nostalgia hit us all at once (especially because it featured Aly's sister and music partner, AJ, which you might remember the sisters as being the rocking duo of Aly and AJ). As Teen Vogue explains, the reason for this wonderful reunion was because of the AMO Ferragamo party Tuesday night.\n\nThis isn't the first time the pair have hung out, though. In an interview with Teen Vogue back in 2017, Michalka told the publication that \u201cRaviv and I keep in touch; we're Instagram buddies. Whenever I'm in New York or he's in L.A., we try to see each other and get lunch.\u201d\n\nIf that isn't enough to completely make your heart sing, the added possibility of a real deal reunion might not be that far out.\n\nMichalka also told TV that she wouldn't be opposed to a Phil Of The Future reunion, saying: \u201cI mean, sure! I guess reunions are a big thing now. I wouldn't be opposed to it. It's a funny idea. I have no idea what they'd do necessarily with the storyline, but yeah, sure.\u201d\n\nWhile this isn't exactly the reunion we were looking for, we'll take it\u2014and who knows, maybe this might spark Disney to get the cast back together sometime before the year 2121 and make a few new episodes of the show\u2026", "images": ["https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/TheUsed_BrianCox_WinterPress-12-1-218x150.jpg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/guitar-100x70.jpeg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-12-100x70.jpg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/Slipknot-2020-live-100x70.jpg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/Disney-star-wars-the-clone-wars-218x150.jpg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/altpress-mcr-holy-book-382-ver-1-248x300.jpg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/05/ALTPRESS-LOGO-700x180.png", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/Slipknot-2020-live-218x150.jpg", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/WEB-HEADER_APR_4_18_20_-100x70.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e15/c138.0.804.804a/s640x640/93714823_676003889876516_4777322235110273407_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=uSBiAcb5RggAX_-1k3C&oh=ab1292bac7b363935b4725e0c21e2daf&oe=5EC58696", "https://www.altpress.com/wp-content/plugins/td-composer/legacy/Newspaper/assets/images/icons/video-small.png.pagespeed.ce.qDY_7QxYfB.png", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e15/c153.0.773.773a/s640x640/93810143_3044797192238493_2807943160027386536_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=aP3ra78LGK0AX9X3HRP&oh=d3c2033e37a26286e418763b1d6dd0a7&oe=5EC7A2F2", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e15/c126.0.827.827a/s640x640/93823606_107031410871113_5404017672940780971_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=J-hn5Ko2xf0AX-MhgSV&oh=a26320c0027c6ae985f51c695bc4bbdb&oe=5EC3F4D9", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/07/phil_of_the_future_2-696x449.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-94v1pMLCes9Wc.gif", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/07/phil_of_the_future_2.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e15/c133.0.814.814a/s640x640/93433005_787354221673339_8045449760026075599_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=vO4q9AEeEB4AX_EB4-h&oh=5ee60a21bd7e0daa7b47b2cd1154177a&oe=5EC5AC0F", "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2020/04/TheUsed_BrianCox_WinterPress-12-1-100x70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/07/phil_of_the_future_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.altpress.com/news/phil_of_the_future_cast_reunion/", "title": "This \u2018Phil Of The Future\u2019 reunion photo was everything we needed today", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/07/phil_of_the_future_2.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/07/phil_of_the_future_2.jpg", "width": 717, "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "This 'Phil Of The Future' reunion photo was everything we needed today - Alternative Press", "description": "[Photo by: Disney Channel] Fans of early 2000s Disney might recall one of the greatest futuristic shows to ever grace the channel, Phil Of The Future.\u00a0While the end of the show made our hearts break (and we'd be lying if we said we're over it), this sweet reunion between the two responsible for our heartbreak \u2026", "url": "https://www.altpress.com/news/phil_of_the_future_cast_reunion/", "site_name": "Alternative Press", "updated_time": "2018-08-07T03:10:13+00:00"}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/altpress", "tag": "reunion", "section": "News", "published_time": "2018-02-08T20:27:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-07T03:10:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "[Photo by: Disney Channel] Fans of early 2000s Disney might recall one of the greatest futuristic shows to ever grace the channel, Phil Of The Future.\u00a0While the end of the show made our hearts break (and we'd be lying if we said we're over it), this sweet reunion between the two responsible for our heartbreak [\u2026]", "title": "This 'Phil Of The Future' reunion photo was everything we needed today - Alternative Press", "site": "@altpress", "image": "http://media.altpress.com/uploads/2018/07/phil_of_the_future_2.jpg", "creator": "@_bethcasteel"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.3", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.altpress.com/uploads/2019/09/cropped-AP_LOGO_BW2-270x270.png", "msvalidate.01": "0EF693D1146F8B7AB368F66CDB341C80"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518121620.0, "source": "https://www.altpress.com", "summary": ""}
