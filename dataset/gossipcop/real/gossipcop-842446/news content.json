Brittany then corrected him, stating that it\u2019s not certain yet that their wedding festivities will be televised.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be two bachelor parties,\u201d said Jax to E! News Daily Pop. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be one for all the guys, we\u2019re going to go on a ski trip in Aspen, I think next month. That one\u2019s going to be off-camera. And then the on-camera one is going to be in Miami.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re hoping on-camera. We don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t been picked up yet,\u201d added Brittany.\n\nWhile the couple has yet to announce their official wedding date, having their bachelor/bachelorette parties in January would point to a winter or spring wedding. And since Vanderpump Rules usually films during the summer months (filming on the latest season started in July), it\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t be getting their own spin-off to document their big day.\n\nAdditionally, as most fans of Pump Rules are aware, a wedding spin-off would not make the first for Brittany and Jax as they had another spin-off last year titled Jax And Brittany Take Kentucky.\n\nWhile Brittany and Jax continue to move forward with plans for their wedding, Brittany, who got engaged to Jax this past June, is opening up about how she moved on from Jax\u2019s fling with Faith Stowers and learned to trust him again.\n\n\u201cI see him every single day making efforts and he\u2019s completely changed the way he treats me, the way he talks to me, the way he listens to me. Every single thing about our relationship is better,\u201d Brittany revealed to Us Weekly. \u201cI know how much he\u2019s wanting the wedding and how much he\u2019s wanting to marry me, how much effort he\u2019s putting into the wedding, just as much as me. I don\u2019t know, whenever you know somebody as well as I know Jax, you can just tell.\u201d\n\nAccording to Brittany, she\u2019s \u201cvery big on forgiveness\u201d but often struggles to forget about Jax\u2019s past infidelity.\n\n\u201cIt is hard, trust me, and there are still days, sometimes, when you can\u2019t help but think of horrible things from the past,\u201d Brittany explained. \u201cBut for the most part, we\u2019ve moved mountains in this relationship. I feel like we\u2019re almost starting over, but we\u2019ve grown so much. He does things before I even ask him now. Even just helping around the house. I can just tell in our everyday lives that he\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules season seven premieres on Monday, December 3 at 9 p.m. on Bravo TV.\n\nPhoto Credit: Birdie Thompson/AdMedia/ZUMA Wire/Alamy Live News", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pump-Rules-Dayna-Kathan-and-Brett-Caprioni-plus-Charli-Burnett-400x284.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shiva-Safai-new-boyfriend-Niels-Houweling-plus-Mohamed-Hadid-e1574892714519-400x283.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-Interview.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Caroline-Manzo-and-Lauren-Manzo-1-e1586962371161-400x285.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vanderpump-Rules-Recap-Tom-Schwartz-and-Katie-Maloney-400x256.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RHONJ-Joe-Giudice-and-Teresa-Giudice-News-400x281.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/12/01/are-vanderpump-ruless-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-getting-a-wedding-spinoff-plus-brittany-admits-its-still-hard-trusting-jax/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-twitter-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/white-logo1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1B.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-Interview-e1543690936983.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Melissa-Gorga-Getting-Her-Mail-Photos-3-400x250.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/feed-logo.png", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/12/01/are-vanderpump-ruless-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-getting-a-wedding-spinoff-plus-brittany-admits-its-still-hard-trusting-jax/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-instagram-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blurb-logo-1@2x.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/34feb98eadd86f8672383a21efe174f9?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-Interview-e1543690936983-1024x655.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jeana-Keough-and-Kara-Keough-e1586961040194-400x295.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/12/01/are-vanderpump-ruless-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-getting-a-wedding-spinoff-plus-brittany-admits-its-still-hard-trusting-jax/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-pinterest-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/2018/12/01/are-vanderpump-ruless-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-getting-a-wedding-spinoff-plus-brittany-admits-its-still-hard-trusting-jax/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-facebook-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kenya-Moore-News-Update-e1577372761358-400x289.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kathryn-Dennis-plus-Thomas-Ravenel-News-400x263.jpg"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-Interview-e1543690936983.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/12/01/are-vanderpump-ruless-brittany-cartwright-and-jax-taylor-getting-a-wedding-spinoff-plus-brittany-admits-its-still-hard-trusting-jax/", "title": "Are Vanderpump Rules' Brittany and Jax Getting a Bravo Wedding Spinoff?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#db0a5b", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Are Vanderpump Rules' Brittany and Jax Getting a Wedding Spinoff?
