Clarkson called for a \u201cmoment of action\u201d to replace the usual \u201cmoment of silence\u201d that follows mass shooting tragedies.\n\n\u201cMy home state has had so much heartbreak over this past year.

It\u2019s not working,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo, why don\u2019t we not do a moment of silence, why don\u2019t we do a moment of action, why don\u2019t we do a moment of change?\u201d\n\nWatch her full remarks below:\n\nGet The Brief.
