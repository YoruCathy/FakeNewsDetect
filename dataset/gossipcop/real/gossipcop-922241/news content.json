Still, she took an unlikely part-time job, as an intern in Disney\u2019s post-production department. \u201cI wanted to learn about editing, visual correction, and sound mixing,\u201d she tells me 25 years later. Not long after, she worked as a production assistant on the 1995 Denzel Washington film Devil in a Blue Dress, helping with casting, among other things. Also: \u201cI parked Denzel\u2019s Porsche!\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nThat inquisitiveness, as well as nearly three decades in front of the camera, has made Witherspoon one of Hollywood\u2019s most astute producers. She turned Gillian Flynn\u2019s Gone Girl into a $369 million worldwide hit in 2014 (that earned Rosamund Pike an Oscar nomination) and did it again, that same year, transforming Cheryl Strayed\u2019s best-selling memoir, Wild, into a breakout success ($52 million plus Oscar nods for Witherspoon and costar Laura Dern). Then came HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies, executive produced with costar Nicole Kidman; the cultural bellwether about female relationships and domestic abuse, based on a novel by Liane Moriarty, swept nearly every category for which it was nominated at the 2017 Emmys. After years of hearing from studio executives that there was no market for female-driven films, Witherspoon had succeeded to a degree that proved a hunger was there. Related: See The 100 Most Creative People In Business 2018 Her instinct for what women want is now being tested on multiple platforms through her 18-month-old storytelling company, Hello Sunshine. She and her team currently have shows in development at Hulu, NBC, and Apple TV (which has partnered on three projects, one rumored to be the biggest deal in history for a straight-to-series show), as well as a film at TriStar/Sony Pictures. But Witherspoon is also laying the foundation for a direct-to-consumer brand, one that is already beginning to speak to women through a website, social media, YouTube and Facebook videos, audiobooks, podcasts, and newsletters\u2014whichever platform she and Hello Sunshine execs think best honors the story being told. For all the company\u2019s digital ambition, Hello Sunshine\u2019s Santa Monica, California, headquarters have an old-fashioned feel. The loft-like interior, with exposed wooden beams and pipes, is cheerfully decorated by Crate & Barrel (Witherspoon collaborates with the retailer). Vintage typewriters and hundreds of books make plain the company\u2019s abiding passions: stories and the people who tell them. Sheets of paper with typewritten words to live by, tacked to a wall, gently rustle every time the front door opens. \u201cI hope that you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there,\u201d reads one, a line from Nora Ephron\u2019s 1996 commencement address at Wellesley College. \u201cAnd I also hope you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women.\u201d Fluorescent signs at the back of the room illuminate a five-word ethos: optimism, humor, curiosity, honesty, generosity. The space\u2014which doubles as a set for interviews\u2014is recognizable from videos on the Hello Sunshine website. Witherspoon\u2019s glassed-in office is within shouting distance of her coworkers, who on a late March day sit or stand at a handful of desks or read books in armchairs. Witherspoon is wearing a navy blazer and a blue shirt with white hearts, both from Draper James, the apparel and housewares brand she launched online in 2015 as a \u201chey y\u2019all!\u201d celebration of her down-home roots. Her look is feminine, but not precious. Or, as her friend Kerry Washington describes it, \u201cgenteel Southern badass.\u201d Witherspoon, in person, bears a distracting similitude to Elle Woods, the character she made famous with 2001\u2019s Legally Blonde. Celeste Ng, whose novel Little Fires Everywhere is being adapted by Hello Sunshine for Hulu, had a similar first reaction: \u201cShe\u2019s bubbly and perky and scarily smart. I thought, Oh my god, it\u2019s Elle Woods! But there\u2019s a kinship with [Election\u2018s] Tracy Flick, too, in that people who underestimate her learn their mistake really fast.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nWherever Witherspoon goes\u2014Asia, Europe, Africa, South America\u2014she is stopped by Legally Blonde fans: \u201cI went to law school because of you,\u201d they\u2019ll say, or, \u201cYou helped me believe in myself.\u201d She gets teary talking about the film\u2019s impact. \u201cI didn\u2019t even understand when I was making it that it was a bit of a modern feminist manifesto,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing a woman who is interested in feminine attitudes\u2014getting her nails done\u2014but who is also interested in promoting herself and accomplishing things was a new idea of feminine. A lot of women related to that, and the feeling of being underestimated.\u201d Related video: Our all-female crew talks women in Hollywood with Reese Witherspoon Cynics might wonder if Witherspoon\u2019s production company was merely designed to capitalize on #MeToo\u2019s momentum. But Hello Sunshine was founded in November 2016, nearly a year before the flood of 60-plus allegations against veteran Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein exposed just how endemic and toxic the industry\u2019s gender imbalance has been. The outpouring of firsthand accounts of sexual abuse from fellow actors encouraged Witherspoon to reveal her own multiple experiences of harassment and assault, including by a director when she was just 16. She was among the Hollywood women who organized the all-black dress code for the Golden Globes this past January as part of the Time\u2019s Up movement.

A post shared by Draper James (@draperjames) on Apr 14, 2018 at 11:09am PDT \u201cPart of me is incredulous,\u201d says Witherspoon of Hollywood\u2019s quick pivot to addressing gender disparity. \u201cI can\u2019t believe people are actually listening now. It\u2019s also a relief,\u201d she adds with a laugh, \u201cnot to have to spend the first 15 minutes of every meeting talking about the lack of content for women. Now it\u2019s, \u2018Yeah, got it.\u2019 \u201d At the same time, she says, \u201ca lot of us are having to step up into leadership positions that we didn\u2019t know we were capable of. I definitely feel that in my life.\u201d Putting more women on screen is a Hello Sunshine mandate. But surfacing the voices of real\u2014and diverse\u2014women is the company\u2019s true mission. There are many female-focused production companies, and several successful digital brands that produce social content directed at women, but no entity has yet tried to do what Witherspoon is attempting: to build a premium independent film and TV studio within a direct-to-consumer, female-led brand that operates on multiple platforms. \u201cFortunately,\u201d Witherspoon says, \u201cI like proving people wrong.\u201d Hello Sunshine is Witherspoon\u2019s third production company. At 25, she had an office and five employees to develop movies for Universal Studios. She called it Type A Films. \u201cI had no idea what I was doing,\u201d she says. \u201cIn four years I produced one film, Penelope, with Christina Ricci. It was beautiful, and I loved it, but it was clear to me that I wasn\u2019t ready to tell stories\u2014because I didn\u2019t know what stories I wanted to tell.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs she aged, substantial roles became harder to come by. \u201cIt was getting laughable how bad the parts were, particularly for women over 35,\u201d says Witherspoon. \u201cAnd that, of course, is when you become really interesting as a woman.\u201d Suddenly, there were stories she wanted to tell. Witherspoon thought about partnering again with a studio to develop films. Her husband, Jim Toth, dissuaded her. Toth is a motion picture talent agent at Creative Artists Agency, and it was apparent to him that his wife was good at reading the zeitgeist and spotting promising authors. Toth told her, \u201c\u2018Babe, do it yourself,'\u201d Witherspoon recalls. \u201c\u2018You read more books than anyone I know. You know what works as well as anyone.'\u201d She also wanted to \u201cfurther the evolution of women\u2019s roles,\u201d she says, and they both knew that partnering with a studio would mean satisfying a corporate mandate. \u201cI\u2019d be making products they like,\u201d she says. Witherspoon joined forces in 2012 with another producer, Bruna Papandrea. They created a company called Pacific Standard, which went on to adapt two of that year\u2019s hottest book properties, Crown Publishing Group\u2019s Gone Girl and Alfred A. Knopf\u2019s Wild (Strayed had personally sent an advance copy directly to Witherspoon in November 2011). Around the time that they were developing Big Little Lies, in 2014, Witherspoon began noting changes in consumer behavior. \u201cWomen weren\u2019t going to movies,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were streaming shows. They were on Instagram and Facebook. Digital was winning. The only way was to go where women are, instead of expecting them to come to us in theaters.\u201d The digital imperative was underscored by her three children\u2014Ava, 18, and Deacon, 14 (with first husband, actor Ryan Phillippe), and 5-year-old Tennessee (with Toth, whom she married in March 2011). For them, YouTube and streaming had replaced watching network TV and going to the movies. Rather than moaning like so many in the industry about the tyranny of tiny screens, Witherspoon became excited by the creative potential of digital platforms and the relationships forged on social media. She joined Instagram in 2013 and started to build an audience (12.8 million followers to date). Draper James\u2014which now has four brick-and-mortar stores\u2014allowed her to become involved with consumers in a more intimate way. \u201cI\u2019d never had that before. I was always behind a screen. And I\u2019m an extrovert,\u201d adds Witherspoon, who remains creative director and the face of the retail company. Witherspoon\u2019s second-ever Instagram post, in May 2013, was about J. Courtney Sullivan\u2019s novel The Engagements (\u201cI love this book! Has anyone else read?\u201d). It got a big-enough reaction that other book recommendations followed. News she posted about Pacific Standard\u2019s coming adaptations of Gone Girl and Wild gave both novels sales bumps. According to Amazon Books, Gone Girl sales tripled following the release of the first movie trailer, then doubled during the opening weekend. Witherspoon learned that she could personally build audiences for movies long before they were released. At the same time, she was also loving the conversations she was having with other women about literature. After starting an informal Instagram-led book club in 2015, Witherspoon grew even more interested in digital community\n\nbuilding. Papandrea preferred to stick with film and TV. The pair decided to dissolve Pacific Standard (though they continue to partner on Big Little Lies; season 2 is due in 2019), and Witherspoon began to think about who might help her build a consumer-facing brand.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf Witherspoon is the soul of Hello Sunshine, then CEO Sarah Harden, a fast-talking Australian, is the heart of the place, pumping life into the operation daily. I meet her in the company\u2019s second office, in Beverly Hills, where the film and TV brainstorming happens. Harden and Witherspoon met through Peter Chernin, who was head of 20th Century Fox when the studio produced 2005\u2019s Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, for which Witherspoon won a Best Actress Oscar. When Chernin left the company, Witherspoon followed his career. \u201cHe is very smart,\u201d she says, \u201cand a good prognosticator.\u201d Chernin had gone on to found his own media company, the Chernin Group, and launch (with AT&T) a subsidiary called Otter Media, dedicated to acquiring and building media brands for niche audiences. One of them, Crunchyroll, is now the largest global distributor of anime. The executive overseeing Otter\u2019s acquisitions was Harden, who watched digital media studio Rooster Teeth turn itself into an online mecca for gamers. \u201cSixty thousand people go to [the Rooster Teeth] convention in Austin every summer,\u201d Harden says. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to find a female equivalent.\u2019 \u201d She spent four years looking at existing female-driven brands. Most \u201cwere beauty- and fashion-focused, publishing-focused. They weren\u2019t video storytelling at their core. And video is expensive,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt takes incisive understanding to build full-scale, profitable businesses around that, and it requires creating a brand people love.\u201d Witherspoon first brought her idea for Hello Sunshine to Chernin in the summer of 2016. One of her criteria: \u201cI needed to have a woman run the company,\u201d she says. Chernin introduced her to Harden, and by November, Otter Media was Hello Sunshine\u2019s only external seed investor (for an amount in the \u201csingle-digit millions,\u201d says Harden), joining Witherspoon, Toth, and investor Seth Rodsky, who was Witherspoon\u2019s partner in founding Draper James. The investment \u201chad nothing to do with Reese being a movie star,\u201d says Chernin. \u201cShe\u2019s a great entrepreneur because of her willpower. And she had a remarkably clear idea of what she wanted to build.\u201d He also saw a potentially lucrative white space for an underserved audience. Unlike the millennial- and coastal-focused brands that dominate the digital landscape, Witherspoon is targeting literate women across America, spanning a strikingly wide age range of 20 to 60. Hello Sunshine now has 19 employees, with 20 more likely to join by year\u2019s end\u2014a workforce that, yes, includes men. It\u2019s important, Witherspoon says, that men \u201cfeel they have an opportunity to create a new reality for the world too.\u201d Underlying everything, says Harden, is books. Witherspoon\u2019s book club picks\u2014and, yes, she chooses each one (helpfully, she reads fast)\u2014were an easy way to establish the company\u2019s tone. One of Harden\u2019s first moves after taking the helm of the company last June was to turn each selection into a monthly event, supported by video interviews with authors (usually conducted by Witherspoon), social posts on, say, a book\u2019s inspiration, and giveaways\u2014all in the service of community building. Maintaining levity is important, says Harden: \u201cYou can go to earnest places very quickly, and Reese will say, \u2018This is not funny! Nothing about this is funny!\u2019 \u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nReese\u2019s Book Club x Hello Sunshine, which counts upwards of 460,000 followers on Instagram, hasn\u2019t reached Oprah book club heights (more than a million followers), but Hello Sunshine is already considered by the publishing industry to be a powerful marketing force. Two of her selections have been HarperCollins titles: Kate Quinn\u2019s The Alice Network and Balli Kaur Jaswal\u2019s Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows. \u201cWith both novels, we saw significant upticks, not just in sales but in distribution,\u201d says Jennifer Hart, a marketing executive at the publishing company, who is particularly optimistic about a recently launched Hello Sunshine newsletter. Witherspoon is world-famous, deep-pocketed, and married to a top agent at a leading Hollywood agency (where she is also a client). It\u2019s tempting for people to attribute her success as a producer to her undeniable advantage. But Witherspoon\u2019s pipeline to the book world is authentic and robust. Since posting her first book recommendation five years ago, she has relied on her taste and instinct to predict, again and again, which titles will resonate with her audience, and that has encouraged the book world to court her attention. The Alice Network became a New York Times bestseller six months after Witherspoon selected it for her book club. HarperCollins even timed the release of last March\u2019s Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows\u2014\u201dwhich wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar as a big book,\u201d says Hart\u2014to coincide with the Hello Sunshine pick. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone out there who is as much of an advocate for female authors, and for pushing out new, diverse voices,\u201d says Hart. Little Fires Everywhere was months from publication when Witherspoon first read it, and she chose it for her book club last September, before it became a monster best seller. Like Big Little Lies, the novel is rich with conversation starters\u2014in this case, adoption, parenting, race, and class. Witherspoon had been looking for a series to coproduce with Kerry Washington, and the minute she finished Little Fires, she emailed the actress. \u201cThe message was, \u2018I\u2019ve found our project!\u2019 \u201d says Washington, who was shooting Scandal at the time. \u201cI finished it in 72 hours. I literally locked myself in a bathroom.\u201d Hulu won the bidding war and is developing the series. @reesewitherspoon and @kerrywashington are on ???????????? with some MAJOR news. ???? our Stories or tap the link in bio to see what they\u2019ve been up to! #LittleFiresEverywhere @pronounced_ing A post shared by Hello Sunshine (@hellosunshine) on Mar 2, 2018 at 10:11am PST Hello Sunshine\u2019s newest venture is a multiyear partnership with Audible, the world\u2019s largest producer of audiobooks, which will allow anyone to access the audio versions of Witherspoon\u2019s monthly book club picks. Don Katz, the founder of the company, now owned by Amazon, had lunch with Witherspoon in May 2017 (they were both speaking at the Milken Conference) and \u201cone thing led to another,\u201d he says. A separate but related deal, Audible Originals x Hello Sunshine, will enable Witherspoon\u2019s company to commission new audio-first or audio-exclusive works from authors, playwrights, and TV writers. \u201cReese is focused on talent\u2014actors and writers\u2014who [are] underemployed for various reasons,\u201d says Katz, \u201cand she\u2019s aware of an audience that is similarly underserved. All of those people come with her.\u201d Chernin says that Hello Sunshine\u2019s biggest challenge now is growing its daily engagement, and Harden and Witherspoon know that one key to this will be maintaining Hello Sunshine\u2019s positive, pro-women voice. Witherspoon has been remarkably savvy in the way she communicates with her audience. But as Lena Dunham, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Tony Robbins might attest, too much honesty can be perilous when you are running a personal brand. A single tone-deaf comment, awkwardly phrased joke, or attempt at \u201cmaking a little trouble\u201d as Nora Ephron suggests, could derail your entire business. But Witherspoon\u2019s wit and straightforwardness are what her fans love about her. If she plays it too safe, she risks losing them, too.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWitherspoon needs to walk off a sciatica flare-up, a recent development, so we stroll from the Santa Monica office to a nearby grocery and caf\u00e9. Witherspoon, who grew up in Nashville, talks about having two doctors as parents\u2014her father is a retired otolaryngologist and her mother has a PhD in pediatric nursing. \u201cMy dad, every day he read medical journals and historical novels. If you didn\u2019t have something interesting to say at the dinner table, it was because you weren\u2019t doing any research or you weren\u2019t a curious person,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s not a people person,\u201d she adds. \u201cI get that from my mom.\u201d Asked about her career role models, she thinks for a few moments. \u201cGoldie Hawn,\u201d she says finally. \u201cWhen she saw studios weren\u2019t making parts for her, she knew her audience and would create a film based on what she knew they wanted to see\u2014Private Benjamin, or Wildcats. Also Dolly Parton, who told me she did her best work partnering with women.\u201d The old trope of the competitive female coworker, will, in Witherspoon\u2019s opinion, disappear as jobs for them increase. \u201cThere\u2019s real power in partnership, and I don\u2019t think we have the ego thing as much.\u201d HBO\u2019s chairman and CEO, Richard Plepler, says that when Witherspoon learned that Nicole Kidman was also interested in optioning Big Little Lies, Witherspoon and Papandrea got in touch with Kidman and suggested that they join forces. \u201cI love that about Reese,\u201d says Plepler. \u201cThere\u2019s room for everyone at the table.\u201d For Witherspoon, partnering with Kidman has proved to be what she calls a \u201cone plus one equals five\u201d strategy: \u201cPeople see the show\u2019s success, that it makes a lot of money for the company, and that will create another show like that.\u201d It\u2019s playing out faster than she could have imagined. Casey Bloys, HBO\u2019s president of programming, admitted in April that the network\u2019s recent equal-pay push (e.g., Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood will earn as much as her male costars starting with season 3) was a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the Time\u2019s Up movement and encouragement he received from Witherspoon. Witherspoon and Kidman, meanwhile, will each take more than $500,000 per episode for season 2 of Big Little Lies. While crunching on avocado oil potato chips at the caf\u00e9, Witherspoon tells me about an exercise she does with her family, on the rare occasions when they watch TV together. A commercial will come on\u2014such as a recent Adidas ad featuring athletes, models, and DJs sitting around a table, talking about what\u2019s cool\u2014and when it\u2019s over, she\u2019ll press pause and ask, \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d In this instance, \u201cthey said they saw a mix of people who were interesting and creative. And I said, \u2018You know what I see? Three women and 13 men at the table. That\u2019s what I see.\u2019 \u201d Invariably, during these exercises, her family will ask her to roll the commercial back to check her math, and she\u2019s usually pretty close. \u201cNow my husband sees it all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just have to ask yourself, What am I not seeing?\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne of the projects in development at Hello Sunshine is a film version of Karin Tanabe\u2019s The Gilded Years, which will be released by TriStar/Sony Pictures next year. The 2016 novel reimagines the true story of the first black graduate of Vassar, in 1897, who was light-skinned enough to pass for white. Witherspoon fast-tracked a bidding war by preemptively casting the immensely popular former Disney star and pop singer Zendaya, who will also coproduce. For the adaptation, called A White Lie, she hired veteran TV screenwriter and producer Monica Beletsky (Fargo, Parenthood) because Beletsky had an idea for how to turn the period piece\u2014always a hard sell with studios and audiences\u2014into a thriller. Beletsky says she\u2019s never before experienced the level of support she received from Hello Sunshine. \u201cIt can\u2019t be overstated how rare it is to find producers who so quickly take a risk on an original idea, who are able to see the same film in their head that I see in mine,\u201d she says. In her experience, producers don\u2019t prep much before pitching movies to studios\u2014\u201dmaybe a phone call the day before,\u201d she says. But prior to her first meeting with potential buyers for A White Lie, Hello Sunshine had her workshop the pitch in front of different groups of employees. \u201cI kid them that I felt like I\u2019d been trained for the movie-storytelling Olympics.\u201d The pitches are multimedia productions: Beletsky described her script in front of images from the period; as she talked about a scene, the real places would appear behind her. She\u2019s half black and half Jewish, so she spent some time talking about identity; Zendaya spoke of \u201ccolorism\u201d and how she connected to the material. At the end of one meeting, a potential buyer said, \u201cWell, the good news is that we\u2019re living in a world where people are more open-minded,\u201d recalls Lauren Neustadter, Hello Sunshine\u2019s head of TV and film development. Witherspoon was dismayed by the comment, Neustadter says, and on the way back to the office Witherspoon asked her assistant to find current photos of the boards of various big corporations, as well as members of Congress.
