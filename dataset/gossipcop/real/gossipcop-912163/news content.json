AnnaLynne McCord spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about what she thinks caused her feud with her costar Shenae Grimes on the set of 90210.\n\nMcCord recently revealed on The Wendy Williams Show that they didn\u2019t get along while filming The CW reboot, and she told Us ego had a lot to do with it. \u201cThere was just discrepancies, ego, so much ego,\u201d she said at the premiere of her movie First We Take Brooklyn on Wednesday, February 7. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that young \u2014 Shenae was 18, I was 20 \u2014 we got this crazy show that had so much hype around it and our egos were out of this world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, you\u2019re kind of thrown into this limelight of Hollywood and early success, and all those things and you\u2019re dealing with your own demons, which she and I both were, secretly,\u201d she continued. \u201cOur hidden stories were very much a big part of what caused us to be the people that perhaps we were.\u201d\n\nMcCord, 30, revealed to Williams on Tuesday, February 6, that after five years of being \u201cat each other\u2019s throats,\u201d Grimes, 28, called her the day before the show wrapped in 2013. They have since put their differences aside and are friends now. McCord attended Grimes\u2019 wedding to model Josh Beech that same year, and the actresses even have dinner dates together.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019ve talked about it a million times now that we\u2019re friends. We hang out at the hot tub at her place,\u201d she told Us. \u201cLast time I was there, I cooked chicken parmigiana, we hung out in her hot tub till 3 a.m. Her neighbors were like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 So we\u2019re like this close now and we\u2019ve talked about so many things.\u201d\n\nThe Amerigeddon actress also revealed to Us that she was dealing with her own trauma, which is what caused her to have issues with her costar. \u201cI know for me I have severe anxiety, I was dealing with trauma that I had never coped with, never even faced, never even acknowledged, and all of that stuff comes out when you\u2019re working 18 to 20 hours a day and you\u2019re with these same people,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see them more than your family, more than your boyfriend. So they\u2019re the ones that you take everything out on, and I think Shanae and I have such strong personalities, the friction was there and it was an energy thing as well.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of trying to grow up a little bit, right? Growing up in front of people is hard.\u201d\n\nThe CW drama aired from 2008 to 2013.\n\nFirst We Take Brooklyn opens in theaters on Friday, February 9 and was directed by Danny A. Abeckaser.\n\nReporting by Nicki Gostin.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/annalynne-mccord.jpg?w=247", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/annalynne-mccord-talks-shenae-grimes-feud/", "title": "AnnaLynne McCord: There Was 'So Much Ego' in Shenae Grimes Feud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "AnnaLynne McCord exclusively spoke to Us Weekly about what caused her feud with her \u201990210\u2019 costar Shenae Grimes \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "AnnaLynne McCord: There Was 'So Much Ego' in Shenae Grimes Feud", "description": "AnnaLynne McCord exclusively spoke to Us Weekly about what caused her feud with her \u201990210\u2019 costar Shenae Grimes \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/annalynne-mccord-talks-shenae-grimes-feud/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-24T20:28:17+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-08T16:18:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-24T20:28:17+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "AnnaLynne McCord exclusively spoke to Us Weekly about what caused her feud with her \u201990210\u2019 costar Shenae Grimes \u2014 details", "title": "AnnaLynne McCord: There Was 'So Much Ego' in Shenae Grimes Feud", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shenae-grimes-and-annalynne-mccord-feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518106718.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
