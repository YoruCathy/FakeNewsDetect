Emily Blunt got nominated twice in the film categories, including for \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d and \u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d and John David Washington broke into the Best Actor field in a mostly white crowd for \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d\n\nBut Regina King, a true standout in Barry Jenkins\u2019 \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d and thus far a presumed front runner in the Oscar race, was snubbed from the Female Actress in a Supporting Role category, as was the movie at large. And the snub has many critics and fans scratching their heads.\n\n\u201cI believe in Regina King,\u201d actress Carrie Coon tweeted in support of the actress after King was left out of the SAG field.\n\nAlso Read: SAG Awards Nominees: The Complete List\n\n\u201cWe love you, Ethan Hawke and Regina King,\u201d screenwriter Phyllis Nagy said of King and another notable acting snub for Ethan Hawke\u2019s work in \u201cFirst Reformed.\u201d\n\nTheWrap\u2019s Steve Pond wrote in his analysis of the nominees that only two actors have ever won the Oscar despite also getting snubbed by the Screen Actors Guild, those being Marcia Gay Harden for \u201cPollock\u201d in 2000 and Christoph Waltz for \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d in 2012.\n\nKing missed out to the aforementioned Blunt, Margot Robbie in \u201cMary Queen of Scots,\u201d Amy Adams in \u201cVice\u201d and Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, both from \u201cThe Favourite.\u201d Some have pointed out the frustrating fact that Stone and Weisz opposite Olivia Colman (also nominated) could all plausibly be called lead actresses in \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d and yet still pushed out King in the supporting actress field.\n\nAlso Read: SAG Awards Nominations by the Numbers: Netflix Is Back on Top\n\n\u201ctbh f\u2014 category fraud,\u201d one fan tweeted. \u201cEmma Stone, Rachel Weisz, Timothee Chalamet, Mahershala Ali and Emily Blunt are the reasons why performers like Regina King, Elizabeth Debicki, Daniel Kaluuya, etc. miss out in the rightful supporting categories. I\u2019m sick of this s\u2014.\u201d\n\nSee some more reactions to the snub below:\n\nWe love you, Ethan Hawke and Regina King. \u2014 Phyllis Nagy (@PhyllisNagy) December 12, 2018\n\nIf only Regina King was in THE KOMINSKY METHOD \u2014 Richard Lawson (@rilaws) December 12, 2018\n\nu know on lemonade when Beyonc\u00e9 said \"so what are you gonna say at my funeral now that you've killed me\" she was talking about her cheating ass husband but she was also talking about the SAGs snubbing regina king! \u2014 hunter harris (@hunteryharris) December 12, 2018\n\nNot mad about the Emily Blunt A QUIET PLACE nod. Furious about the Regina King and BEALE STREET snubs. Want to ban movies forever over the BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY love. #SAGAwards \u2014 Kevin Fallon (@kpfallon) December 12, 2018\n\nOh, SAG. How'd you miss Regina King, you dopey goons? That wasn't a hard one. \u2014 Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) December 12, 2018\n\nAs today\u2019s Regina King snub begins to sink in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Aaa0uyYlzH \u2014 Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) December 12, 2018\n\nRegina King and Ethan Hawke were robbed by @SAGawards \u2013but @TheAcademy will come through. Mainstream crowdpleasers A Star Is Born, Black Panther, BlacKkKlansmen, Bohemian Rhapsody and Crazy Rich Asians will not all translate to higher-brow Oscars. \u2014 Anne Thompson (@akstanwyck) December 12, 2018\n\nAmy Adams (VICE, SHARP OBJECTS), Emma Stone (FAVOURITE, MANIAC) and Emily Blunt (MARY POPPINS, QUIET PLACE) were all nominated for multiple #SAG awards this morning.\n\nBiggest shocker: Where's Regina King?

Huge shock. Can she still win the Oscar? #SAGawards \u2014 Daniel Howat (@howatdk) December 12, 2018\n\nJust want to show Regina King (@ReginaKing) a picture of this woman. Her name is Marcia Gay Harden and she won the Oscar in 2000 for \"Pollock\" without that precious nomination from the #SAGAwards!
