Photo: Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNoted sculptor Brad Pitt is famously single \u2014 and apparently fighting off gangs of thirsty women everywhere he goes. So it should come as no surprise that sometimes the baggy-pants aficionado chooses to go incognito with the ladies by using a different name. Or should we say, his real name.\n\nAs Wikipedia confirms, Brad Pitt was actually born William Bradley Pitt. And wouldn\u2019t you know, according to \u201cPage Six,\u201d dear ol\u2019 Brad recently introduced himself as William when chatting with a lady at Coffee Commissary in Los Angeles.\n\nPitt reportedly showed up on his motorcycle, wearing \u201csunglasses, jeans and a leather jacket\u201d (how cool), and sparked up a conversation with a woman in line who \u201clooked a little like Kate Bosworth, but it wasn\u2019t her.\u201d Per \u201cPage Six\u201d:\n\nWhen the woman said, \u201cI\u2019m Lydia,\u201d Pitt \u201cput out his hand and said, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m William.\u2019 She replied, \u2018Oh, you look like a Bradley.\u2019 And he responded, \u2018Well, that\u2019s my middle name\u2019 and smiled and winked at her.\u201d\n\nAs Lydia exited she said, \u201c\u2018Nice to meet you, Bradley . . . I mean William.\u2019 He laughed to himself, then got on his bike.\u201d\n\nSounds a lot like another William we know.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/01/03/03-brad-pitt.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/01/03/03-brad-pitt.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/01/03/03-brad-pitt.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/brad-pitt-william-flirting-dating-page-six.html", "title": "Brad Pitt Calls Himself \u2018William\u2019 When Flirting: \u2018Page Six\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Brad Pitt Reportedly Uses a Different Name When Flirting", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/brad-pitt-william-flirting-dating-page-six.html", "description": "\u201cHi, I\u2019m William.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/01/03/03-brad-pitt.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Brad Pitt Reportedly Uses a Different Name When Flirting", "description": "\u201cHi, I\u2019m William.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/01/03/03-brad-pitt.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@lisarya", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-03T08:40:52.162-05:00", "tag": "brad pitt, william, culture, celebrity, dating, flirting", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "\u201cPage Six\u201d reports Brad Pitt recently flirted with a woman in Los Angeles and introduced himself as William, his given name.", "sailthru.tags": "brad pitt, william, culture, celebrity, dating, flirting", "author": "Lisa Ryan", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514986852.162, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
