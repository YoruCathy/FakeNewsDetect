Rhimes and Nowalk posted the same screen shot of a page from a crossover script featuring both Kerry Washington\u2019s Scandal character, Washington fixer Olivia Pope, and Viola Davis\u2019 How To Get Away with Murder character, law professor Annalise Keating. It appears to reveal the women\u2019s first meeting. \u201cPeople. It\u2019s happening,\u201d Rhimes captioned her post (you can see it below), with both using hashtags, #TGITCrossover and #HowtoGetAwaywithScandal.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Deadline, Nowalk shares as many details as he could without spoiling the stunt for the fans, including who will be part of the crossover and will Washington and Davis share scenes, something the script excerpt confirms. He also provides clues about the storyline\u2019s setting and the event\u2019s timing.\n\nRelated Story Charles Gregory Ross Dies Of COVID-19: Ava DuVernay, Tyler Perry, Lee Daniels, Viola Davis And More Pay Tribute To Legendary Hairstylist\n\nDEADLINE: How did the idea about a Scandal-How To Get Away With Murder crossover come about?\n\nNOWALK: At the beginning of the season, my writers and I were planning out Viola\u2019s entire arc and something in her story organically came up that was very appropriate for Scandal. When I went to Shonda, she heard it. I said, we don\u2019t have to do it, Viola\u2019s arc doesn\u2019t need this, but it\u2019s possible that their stories could cross really organically. She actually pulled up a clip of something from Scandal and their side of the story coalesced perfectly. So it was one of those serendipitous things where we both realized it was good for both characters, and it almost felt like we had been planning it since last season.\n\nAt that point, we just thought about it because we didn\u2019t want it to feel forced, and we just wanted it to happen really naturally. And then if anything bumps along the way, we just won\u2019t do it. We kept getting closer and closer, and it just made more and more sense. I will say, the Scandal read-through, I, as an audience member, just found it so refreshing and fun, and it really felt like Annalise fit in that episode really well. So now the pressure for us for Murder is just to match that level of excitement that they created.\n\nDEADLINE: I assume that the episodes will be tied together in a two-hour block on the same night, with the story starting on Scandal and finishing on How To Get Away With Murder?\n\nNOWALK: Yes.\n\nDEADLINE: Will we see both Olivia on How To Get Away With Murder and Annalise on Scandal as well as on their own shows?\n\nABC\n\nNOWALK: I\u2019ll say the whole two hours takes place in the same setting, and they have that arc over those two hours together.\n\nDEADLINE: One show is set in Philadelphia, the other one in Washington, DC. If the setting is the same throughout the crossover, is that setting Washington, DC, Philadelphia, or a third location?\n\nNOWALK: All I\u2019ll say is that the setting for each of them is consistent. The storyline for Olivia and Annalise takes place in one location.\n\nDEADLINE: Are the events in the two episodes continuous? Is there a gap between what happens on Scandal and Murder?\n\nNOWALK: There\u2019s not much of a gap, and in case someone watches one show on Netflix and not the other, the episodes make sense for each character on their own.\n\nDEADLINE: Will there be scenes with Kerry\u2019s Olivia and Viola\u2019s Annalise together?\n\nNOWALK: Yes, Annalise and Olivia will be in scenes together.\n\nDEADLINE: Will each of them also interact with other characters on the other show?\n\nNOWALK: There will be some of that.\n\nDEADLINE: Is it fair to say that Annalise and Olivia will team up to do something together?\n\nNOWALK: I don\u2019t think we want to give that away yet. If I were a viewer, the thing I would want to see is Kerry and Viola in a scene together, that was really the reason to do it. To have storyline together and really shed light on both of their characters in a new way. That, of course, means that Annalise is in Olivia\u2019s world during the Scandal episode, so she\u2019ll be meeting the Scandal characters, and Olivia is in the Murder world, and she\u2019ll be meeting some of the Murder characters. You\u2019ll see that crossover.\n\nDEADLINE: Will there be any other Scandal and Murder actors crossing over besides the two leads?\n\nNOWALK: Yes, but we are not ready to reveal which ones yet.\n\nDEADLINE: When will the crossover air? Is it going to be close to the series finale of Scandal?\n\nNOWALK: It will be airing a few episodes before the finale,\n\nDEADLINE: Will the crossover be self-contained? Will there be fallout from what happens in it for each of the shows going forward?\n\nNOWALK: Yes, I think why we both agreed to do it, Shonda and I, is it fit into our longer arc. So it\u2019s not like a procedural where it just stands alone and it has nothing to do with the rest of their arcs for the season. They\u2019re actually both very pivotal to each other\u2019s storylines.\n\nDEADLINE: How was it writing for the character of Olivia? You worked on Scandal before creating HTGAWM, right?\n\nNOWALK: I did work on Scandal right before Murder, I worked on it for half of a season, and it\u2019s really fun. You\u2019re getting me where I\u2019m in the middle of it with my writers, and the challenge of this, of course, is writing someone else\u2019s character, which I did for Shonda for years, but I still have that old, staff writer desire to want to make sure that Olivia sounds right and that she\u2019s in keeping with what Shonda has created for her. I kind of was kicking myself when I realized how stressful it would be, but I think it\u2019s really fun to write her, but it\u2019s also really fun to write her with Annalise. I think there\u2019s so much story to mine there between these two very different characters who are powerful in really different ways.\n\nDEADLINE: Who\u2019s writing and directing each of the two crossover episodes?\n\nNOWALK: For the Scandal episode, it\u2019s one of their key writers, Raamla Mohamed, writing and co-star Tony Goldwyn directing. Then we have two of our writers on staff here, Sarah Thompson and Morenike L. Balogun, they\u2019ve been taking lead and working on this for a really long time, because we had to obviously strategize and have all of our ducks in a row and plan really well to make this work. Zetna Fuentes is directing.\n\nDEADLINE: What was the reaction of Kerry and Viola, of the writers on the two shows to the news of a crossover?\n\nNOWALK: What\u2019s lovely about working with the writers on Scandal and vice versa is that we all know each other, and we all have worked together, and so, for me, it was really fun to get to see what their process is and get to just hang out with my old friends who we never get to see each other because we\u2019re all so busy.\n\nShutterstock\n\nFor the actors, I\u2019ve heard secondhand that Kerry was really excited when Shonda told her. Viola had an instant smile on her face, and I think they\u2019ve wanted to work together for a really long time outside of doing publicity. So I think it was really fun for both of them, even though I will say I have to give them both credit. They\u2019re working double stories in these episodes because they added a whole other episode to their schedule. So they\u2019re very tired right now, as they should be, but I think in the end, it will be something really memorable for Shondaland, and I\u2019m loving it. It feels like a boost of energy for us.\n\nDEADLINE: Currently, there is a big mystery on Scandal, a cliffhanger about Quinn. Will Annalise will be involved in the search for Quinn?\n\nNOWALK: I can\u2019t speak to anything about Scandal. You know Shonda. All I know is the episode that Annalise is in about Scandal. So, you know, I like to keep my job here, so I\u2019m not going to answer any Scandal questions.\n\nDEADLINE: Anything else you can tell me about the the making of the crossover, the level of security in how you\u2019ve been planning it?\n\nNOWALK: Well, we thought the security was really good, but you\u2019re also really good at your job, so you found out, but this is as secure as we get with this episode. Scripts are really under lock, and that really is just about maintaining the fun for the audience, because the thrill of these shows is the surprise a bunch of the time, and I think that\u2019s the really good surprise.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/scandal-4.jpg?w=359&h=240", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kerry-washingon-viola-davis-2.jpg?w=630", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_05161.jpg?w=359&h=240", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/shutterstnowalkdavis.jpg?w=281&h=281", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2Fscandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202234080&comment_count=2", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/peternowalk.jpg?w=204&h=319"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kerry-washingon-viola-davis-2.jpg?w=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/scandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080/", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019/\u2019How To Get Away With Murder\u2019 Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From \u2018HTGAWM\u2019 Creator \u2013 Q&A", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk confirm a crossover event this season.", "news_keywords": "How To Get Away With Murder, Kerry Washington, Scandal, Shonda Rhimes, Viola Davis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019/\u2019How To Get Away With Murder\u2019 Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From \u2018HTGAWM\u2019 Creator \u2013 Q&A", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/scandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080/", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: TGIT fans can rejoice \u2013 Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk just confirmed our scoop that the two Shondaland drama series\u00a0will be staging a\u2026", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kerry-washingon-viola-davis-2.jpg?w=630", "width": 630, "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-03T20:04:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-04T17:26:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Deadline", "text": {"title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019/\u2019How To Get Away With Murder\u2019 Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From \u2018HTGAWM\u2019 Creator \u2013 Q&A"}, "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kerry-washingon-viola-davis-2.jpg?w=630", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@DeadlineNellie", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019/\u2019How To Get Away With Murder\u2019 Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From \u2018HTGAWM\u2019 Creator \u2013 Q&A", "description": "Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk confirm a crossover event this season."}, "author": "Nellie Andreeva", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202234080, "title": "'Scandal'/'How To Get Away With Murder' Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From 'HTGAWM' Creator - Q&A", "published_at": "2018-01-03 12:04:06", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kerry-washingon-viola-davis-2.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1", "comment_count": 2, "tags": "Viola Davis", "topics": "TV", "body": "EXCLUSIVE: TGIT fans can rejoice \u2013 Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk just confirmed our scoop that the two Shondaland drama series\u00a0will be staging a crossover event this season.
