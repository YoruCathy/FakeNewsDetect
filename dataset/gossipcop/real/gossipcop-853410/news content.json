Murray gets really drunk, really fast.\n\n\u201cOnce again, hurricane Murray is passing through,\u201d Brandi says.\n\nHis \u201cstraight\u201d friend Giancarlo is there to dance with him and act anything but straight.\n\n\u201cGiancarlo swears that he\u2019s straight, but I don\u2019t know how many straight dude tells other guys they smell good,\u201d Elizabeth says.\n\nCory walks in while Murray is being too cozy with Giancarlo. Actually, he has shirt pulled up and his \u201cstraight\u201d friend is feeling his abs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s straight,\u201d Elizabeth tells Cory, as they watch together.\n\n\u201cYeah, and I believe in unicorns,\u201d Cory says.\n\n\u201cStraight my ass,\u201d Cory says.\n\n\u201cI feel like telling Cory, Spoiler Alert! Your boyfriend is a slut,\u201d Elizabeth says.\n\nCory and Murray have another argument in public.\n\nBut Murray\u2019s too drunk to have a conversation.\n\n\u201cCan you not throw a drink at me?\u201d Murray asks, kinda politely. It\u2019s hilarious.\n\nMarissa\u2019s mom Debbie is in town to visit and convince her daughter to move back to New York.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from an Italian family \u2013 moving out of the house is harder than quitting the mafia,\u201d Marissa says.\n\nFulfilling all Italian mother stereotypes, Debbie\u2019s worried Marissa isn\u2019t eating.\n\n\u201cThe same thing that you\u2019re doing here, you can do in New York,\u201d her mom says.\n\nMarissa says she\u2019s following her dream. Is it her dream to be a cocktail waitress?\n\nShe tells her mother that she\u2019s invited to The Abbey that night.\n\n\u201cRight, before we even go there, am I allowed to talk to people?\u201d mom asks.\n\nYes, she may, but only if the people approach her.\n\nShe also tells her mom about Kyle.\n\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re a little quick,\u201d her mom says.\n\nYes, Marissa, your mom did just imply that you\u2019re a slut.\n\nTurns out, Marissa left a man back in New York. And he still thinks they\u2019re a couple. #Oops\n\nWhen her mom gets to The Abbey, Marissa has Billy come take a pic with mom because mom loves Nick-the-Gardner.\n\nBut Mom Debbie doesn\u2019t seem excited when she first meets Kyle.\n\n\u201cOMG my mom is totally icing Kyle right now,\u201d Marissa says.\n\nThe whole thing is so uncomfortable, I don\u2019t even want to watch. #Awkward\n\nBut then she warms up. She does like getting her hands on the younger men.\n\n\u201cClearly, Kyle passed the mom test. A little too well,\u201d Marissa says.\n\nHeidi Montage and her entourage hit The Abbey for drinks, and owner David Cooley greets them.\n\nHeidi is a regular.\n\nMarissa\u2019s mom is bird-dogging Heidi Montag from across the bar.\n\nThen she goes for it.\n\n\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m such a big fan,\u201d Debbie squeals.\n\nThen she proceeds to tell Heidi her daughter\u2019s whole story.\n\n\u201cMarissa, come take a picture of me. Isn\u2019t she cute?\u201d she asks Heidi.\n\n\u201cI told her all about you, Marissa,\u201d Debbie says.\n\nHeidi is actually pretty gracious about the whole thing.\n\n\u201cHeidi Montag is literally everything,\u201d Marissa says.\n\nOh, jeez.\n\nGirl has some really inspirational role models. Bahaha!\n\nAt the end of the trip, her mom cries all the way to the airport.\n\n\u201cMarissa, I love you, and you can always come home anytime,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter she drops off Debbie at LAX, Marissa goes over the Kyle\u2019s house to show him some headshots.\n\nAnd Marissa mentions that the laptop was a gift from her boyfriend back home.\n\n\u201cTechnically, I have a boyfriend back home,\u201d Marissa\u2019s a little sleazy. Poor guy back in New York is going to be humiliated when the show airs.\n\nKyle\u2019s turned off. Don\u2019t blame him.\n\nLawrence and Brandi go to see a fertility doc about having a baby together, and everything looks good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let the family in on the plan,\u201d Lawrence says.\n\nLawrence and Brandi invite Lawrence\u2019s dad to lunch at The Abbey to tell him they\u2019re going to have a baby.\n\nDad\u2019s concerned about what happens if they want to take their lives different directions.\n\n\u201cKid comes first,\u201d Lawrence says.\n\n\u201cWe call this the house,\u201d Lawrence gives his father a picture of Brandi\u2019s uterus.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done anything more to honor me as your father,\u201d he says.\n\nI want to laugh really hard, but I think the guy is sincere.\n\nGlad it went smoothly for Lawrence and Brandi.\n\nIt\u2019s not going smoothly for besties Kim and Elizabeth the day after the big party where they hooked up, with an audience, in their boss\u2019s swimming pool.\n\n\u201cMe and Elizabeth had our special moment,\u201d Kim says.\n\n\u201cThis is classic straight girl oops,\u201d Elizabeth says. Her feelings are hurt.\n\n\u201cA few harmless kisses in a pool and she\u2019s already renting a U-Haul for us,\u201d Kim says.\n\n\u201cI made out with you because I was drunk and having a good time,\u201d Kim says.\n\n\u201cIf I was straight you would not have done what you did,\u201d Elizabeth says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m officially liking Kim romantically,\u201d Elizabeth says in interview\n\nAshlee invites Daniel over to her house to make truffles. He thinks \u201ctruffles\u201d are a code word for sex.\n\nTurns out Ashlee is a Beverly Hills trust fund baby. But she\u2019s trying to start her own truffle business to prove she can make it on her own.\n\nDaniel thinks her truffles \u201ctaste like dirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt first, I thought Daniel might be little bit nervous. But then I realize that Daniel is dumb as a brick,\u201d Ashlee says.\n\nDaniel thinks he\u2019s got it all going on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be a little intimidated by me too,\u201d Daniel says. What? ROFL\n\n\u201cYou were a lot nicer at the pool,\u201d Daniel says.\n\nAshlee says it\u2019s more like doing charity work than having a date.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie Ashlee. I think you struck out with me. But we can still be friends,\u201d Daniel doesn\u2019t take social clues very well as he\u2019s ushered out the door as quickly as possible.\n\nNext week it appears they\u2019re doing naked yoga. And now I don\u2019t really ever want to see naked yoga.\n\nThings we\u2019re left wondering\n\nWhy is Daniel\u2019s ego so big? What am I missing here? I\u2019m so not impressed by him.\n\nWill Elizabeth and Kim be able to stay friends after the hookup?\n\nWill Kyle totally give up on Marissa after her boyfriend revelation? Or is she cute enough to survive that?\n\nWhat Happens at The Abbey airs Sundays at 10/9c on E!", "images": ["https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ashlee-and-daniel.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/giancarlo.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cropped-cropped-mc-logo-stroke-1-1.png", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/utility-pro/images/facebook.png", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kyle.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/utility-pro/images/email.png", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/utility-pro/images/twitter.png", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/baby.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kim.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/heidi.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cory-and-elizabeth.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dad.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/giancarlo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sandy Malone"], "canonical_link": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/what-happens-at-the-abbey-recap-the-murrays-a-slut-and-marissas-a-cheater-edition/", "title": "What Happens at The Abbey recap: The Murray\u2019s a slut and Marissa\u2019s a cheater edition", "meta_data": {"description": "What Happens at The Abbey recap: Murray is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Ho, and Marissa has somebody at home that she forgot to mention to Kyle", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What Happens at The Abbey recap: The Murray's a slut and Marissa's a cheater edition", "description": "What Happens at The Abbey recap: Murray is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Ho, and Marissa has somebody at home that she forgot to mention to Kyle", "url": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/what-happens-at-the-abbey-recap-the-murrays-a-slut-and-marissas-a-cheater-edition/", "site_name": "Monsters and Critics", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/giancarlo.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/giancarlo.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 443}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/monsterscritics", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/SandyMaloneWIV/", "tag": "What Happens At The Abbey", "section": "Smallscreen", "published_time": "2017-05-22T03:00:27+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 220249472958}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "What Happens at The Abbey recap: Murray is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Ho, and Marissa has somebody at home that she forgot to mention to Kyle", "title": "What Happens at The Abbey recap: The Murray's a slut and Marissa's a cheater edition", "site": "@monstersandcrit", "image": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/giancarlo.jpg", "creator": "@SandyMalone_"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "9abcc0658f1dd4ad8d86a2c33eba0388"}, "google-site-verification": "W0V7_Td7mscUYxsJwzRBhIxHF4JB2PnzdGVKDImP54o", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cropped-monsters-critics-favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495422027.0, "source": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com", "summary": ""}
