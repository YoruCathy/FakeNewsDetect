A joint British and American production, it is a spin-off of and prequel to the Harry Potter film series. It was produced and written by J. K. Rowling in her screenwriting debut, inspired by her 2001 \"guide book\" of the same name. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Carmen Ejogo, and Colin Farrell. It is the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts film series, and ninth overall in the Wizarding World franchise that began with the Harry Potter films.\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them premiered in New York City on 10 November 2016 and opened in cinemas worldwide on 18 November 2016 in 3D, IMAX 3D 4K Laser and other large-format cinemas. It received generally positive reviews from critics and emerged a commercial success after grossing $814 million worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2016.\n\nThe film was nominated for five BAFTAs, including Best British Film, and won for Best Production Design. It was nominated for two Academy Awards and won for Best Costume Design, becoming the first Wizarding World film to win an Academy Award.[9] The first sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released on 16 November 2018.[10] Filming for a second sequel, as yet unnamed, will begin in spring 2020, with a projected release date in November 2021.[11]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIn 1926, British wizard and \"magizoologist\" Newt Scamander arrives in New York, en route to Arizona. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (\"No-Maj\" or \"Muggle\") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speaking about witches and wizards being real and dangerous, a Niffler escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted Auror (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.\n\nAfter Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained Obscurus, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died: Those afflicted rarely live past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After they re-capture two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing Senator Henry Shaw, Jr.. The Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death in secret, but they escape, aided by Queenie and Jacob, who also retrieve Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old goblin informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the escaped creatures.\n\nMeanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus that he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, who he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic as he had previously promised. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.\n\nNewt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence (she lost her job trying to protect him from Mary Lou) arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle back into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society. However, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits his plan to unleash the Obscurus, expose the magical community to the No-Majs and frame Newt for it. He angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks and begins to defeat all of them. Newt manages to subdue him with one of his beasts, and uses a revealing spell to expose Graves as Grindelwald in disguise; he is taken into custody.\n\nMACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion as rainfall over the city, erasing all New Yorkers' recent memories while MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories.\n\nJacob and the rest of the No-Majs are obliviated with the help of the Thunderbird, and Newt returns to England. Jacob opens a bakery: Some of his products look like the beasts he met. Queenie enters, and Jacob smiles at her.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them panel at the 2016 panel at the 2016 San Diego Comic Con International (left to right): director Yates; actors Redmayne, Waterston, Sudol, Fogler, Farrell, Miller.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is mentioned several times as a school textbook in the Harry Potter book series, although Scamander himself does not appear in any of the books.

The school itself is mentioned in the film.[62]\n\nA \"story pack\" based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was released for the video game Lego Dimensions by WB Games and TT Games. The pack includes a constructible model of MACUSA, figures of Newt Scamander and a Niffler, and a six-level game campaign that adapts the film's events.

It debuted with \u00a315.33 million ($19.15 million) from 666 cinemas, the biggest debut of any film in 2016, ahead of the previous record holder, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (\u00a314.62 million).[47][68] The film vied with Bridget Jones' Baby and briefly won first place, only to be surpassed during the last days of 2016 by Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.[69]\n\nUnited States and Canada [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, estimates predicted that the film would gross $68\u201385 million\u2014or more\u2014in its opening weekend.

In total, the opening weekend was worth $7 million from 276 screens, which is the second-highest ever in the Wizarding World, behind Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2. In 33 territories, it opened at number one. Moreover, it's also the third-highest-grossing November international IMAX opening ever, and the No. 1 start for IMAX in November in 19 countries including Japan ($1.1 million), the UK, Russia, Germany, and the Netherlands.[47] In China, it had the biggest IMAX opening among the franchise with $5.1 million from 347 IMAX screens.[48] Overall, the film has earned a global cumulative total of $19.1 million from the format.[48]\n\nIt has become the highest-grossing film in Rowling's cinematic universe in Russia ($16.7 million) and the second-highest in South Korea ($24.6 million).

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them draws on Harry Potter's rich mythology to deliver a spin-off that dazzles with franchise-building magic all its own.\"[87] Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, gives the film a score 66 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 90% positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[7][89]\n\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five out of five stars, hailing it as \"a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment\" and a \"terrifically good-natured, unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film\".[90] NME's Larry Bartleet also gave it five out of five, calling it \"more enchanting to your inner kid than the Potter films ever were\".[91] IndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ saying that it \"delivers the most satisfying period fantasy since Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street \", and that its layers of sophistication made it one of the best Hollywood blockbusters of the year.[92]\n\nMike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, writing \"Newt Scamander is nothing like Harry, but it has to be this way. It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us\".[93] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is \"likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them\".[94] However, New York Magazine's David Edelstein deemed the film a \"distinctly unmagical slog\", remarking that the beasts \"aren\u2019t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating\".[95] In a mixed review, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the film \"patchy but occasionally charming.\"[96]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nNotes\n\nSequels [ edit ]\n\nInitially, in October 2014, the studio announced the film would be the start of a trilogy.
