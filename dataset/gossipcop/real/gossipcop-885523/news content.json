The tactics and tenor of her defense of Mr. Weinstein have varied, and there were often substantial differences in her public and private statements. The emails, viewed by The New York Times, reveal that at least two board members did not approve of her approach.\n\nAs the board convened an emergency phone meeting on Thursday evening to address the allegations, published in an investigation by The Times, Ms. Bloom sent an email to board members attacking the article. She outlined a plan that involved \u201cmore and different reporting,\u201d including \u201cphotos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Twohey", "Johanna Barr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html", "title": "Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-10-07T17:55:21.000Z", "modified": "2017-10-07T23:16:05.000Z", "section": "Business", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/megan-twohey", "tag": "Boards of Directors", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005484418, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/65fbe6be-5def-5c8d-ba77-bd8044a67773", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/e277cf74e31747b5ac9a8d3e3ac67fb8", "description": "Ms. Bloom had been counseling the Hollywood mogul, who faces sexual harassment allegations, but was rebuked by at least two board members, including his brother, Bob Weinstein.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Megan Twohey and Johanna Barr", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Sexual harassment,Movies,Lisa Bloom,Board of directors", "pdate": 20171007, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html", "type": "article", "title": "Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Lisa Bloom resigned on Saturday as an adviser to Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer who has been accused of sexual harassment."}, "description": "Ms. Bloom had been counseling the Hollywood mogul, who faces sexual harassment allegations, but was rebuked by at least two board members, including his brother, Bob Weinstein."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html", "title": "Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members", "description": "Ms. Bloom had been counseling the Hollywood mogul, who faces sexual harassment allegations, but was rebuked by at least two board members, including his brother, Bob Weinstein.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/business/08xp-bloom-SUB/07xp-bloom-alpha-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Lisa Bloom resigned on Saturday as an adviser to Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer who has been accused of sexual harassment."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/65fbe6be-5def-5c8d-ba77-bd8044a67773"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "business", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/65fbe6be-5def-5c8d-ba77-bd8044a67773", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/business/lisa-bloom-weinstein-attorney.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507305600.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
