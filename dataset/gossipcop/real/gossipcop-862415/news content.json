The deal values the company at up to $1 billion: $700 million in cash upfront and up to $300 million more if it hits sales targets over the next decade.\n\n\u201cIf you asked us four years ago if we had a billion-dollar company, I don\u2019t think we would have said yes,\u201d Mr. Clooney said in a statement. \u201cThis reflects Diageo\u2019s belief in our company and our belief in Diageo.\u201d\n\nThe transaction makes Mr. Clooney one of the most successful celebrity investors around.\n\nHollywood stars over the years have often played venture capitalists on the side, taking stakes in an array of start-ups. Among them are Kevin Spacey and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have poured money into Casper, the mattress maker, and Justin Bieber, who has invested in Spotify. Ashton Kutcher may now be better known for his investments than for his IMDB entries, having taken stakes in what Crunchbase reckons are 61 start-ups, like Airbnb and Change.org.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/22/business/22db-clooney2/22db-clooney2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/22/business/22db-clooney3/22db-clooney3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/22/business/22db-clooney2/22db-clooney2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/22/business/22db-clooney2/22db-clooney2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael J.
