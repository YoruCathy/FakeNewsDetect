Images of me being whipped, hung, beaten and it really affected me.\u201d\n\nWatch the full story on \"Nightline\" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET\n\nKordei said she was accused of being disrespectful, and when she apologized for the inadvertent offense, the online hatred only worsened.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing about social media, there\u2019s no repercussions,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like then I became more reserved and closed off person, and afraid of letting people in.\u201d\n\nThe abuse became so bad that Kordei said she took a hiatus from all social media for two months, which was difficult for her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of who we are and how we communicate, so I just felt with me stepping away from social media for two whole months, my core fans, I felt I was neglecting them in a way.\u201d\n\nKordei first rose to fame as a participant on the \u201cThe X Factor\u201d in 2012. She then became one of the teen girls molded by famed music producer Simon Cowell to be a part of the all-female group Fifth Harmony. \u201cWorth It\u201d was their first big hit.\n\nMost recently, Kordei has been a participant on \u201cDWTS.\" It was her dance partner Val Chmerkovskiy who encouraged her to share her story, she said.\n\n\u201cThe beauty is it [social media] gave a voice to everybody,\u201d Chmerkovskiy said. \u201cBut the downside is it also gave a voice to everybody. And a lot of people don\u2019t have the best intentions, for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nKordei was raised in New Orleans and says she has dealt with bullies since she was young.\n\n\u201cI went to a predominantly white school and I stuck out because I was the black girl, but I would get teased for the color of my skin and wonder why,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember we were playing outside and the first thing this little girl would tell me was, \u2018Leave me alone you burnt biscuit.\u2019 \u2026 I mean, where do you get that from, especially being so young?\u201d\n\nAfter coming back on social media, Kordei said she continues to deal with hate from anonymous internet users every day.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned in how to deal with it is it has absolutely nothing to do about me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely an insecurity that other people have in themselves. or something that they lack that you may have that they want\u2026 That\u2019s why I can\u2019t carry hate in my heart.\u201d\n\nShe hopes her dancing every Monday night on \u201cDWTS\u201d will inspire others not to be afraid to be proud of who they are.\n\n\u201cI think that at the end of the day as humans we just need to be more sympathetic to each other,\u201d she said.\n\nABC's Nick Watt contributed to this report", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/ABC-normani-kordei-02-jef-170515_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/ABC-normani-kordei-02-jef-170515_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Stefan Doyno", "Lauren Effron", "May", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dwts-normani-kordei-harmony-dealing-horrific-cyberbullying-carry/story?id=47427362", "title": "DWTS' Normani Kordei of Fifth Harmony on dealing with horrific cyberbullying: 'I can't carry hate in my heart'", "meta_data": {"description": "Normani Kordei of Fifth Harmony made a profound statement last week on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d when she danced to the song \u201cFreedom\u201d and opened up about being bullied.", "keywords": "dancing with the stars, Normani Kordei, fifth harmony,", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
