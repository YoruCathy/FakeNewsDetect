It\u2019s important to look good.\u2019 I was like, \u2018OK, Nan.\u2019\u201d\n\nKerr, 34, and Spiegel, 26, became engaged last July and tied the knot in late May in a warm, family-centred ceremony in the garden of their $16 million Brentwood mansion.\n\nIt was an intimate twilight affair, and featured no other bridal party except Kerr\u2019s son, six-year-old son Flynn (who\u2019s dad is Orlando Bloom), who was a ring-bearer.\n\nTMZ recorded footage while outside their home, which has audio of Kerr singing You\u2019re Still The One, a hit recorded by Shania Twain.\n\nWith a personal combined value of more than $6.7 billion, Kerr and Spiegel met in 2014 at a New York dinner party and started dating a year later.", "images":
