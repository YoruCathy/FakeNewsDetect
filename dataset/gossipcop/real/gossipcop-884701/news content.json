I feel the ache that we all feel,\" she shared. \"As the names are coming out and you get to see who they are by name, I speak their names out loud in thoughtful prayer.\"\n\nIn light of the shooting rampage that left 59 people dead and more than 500 injured, the 60 Minutes special contributor believes people should \"appreciate the ordinary.\"\n\n\"I still think about, not just on the anniversary of 9/11, I still think about \u2014 sometimes at the oddest times \u2014 when I\u2019m putting on my shoes, when I\u2019m taking a shower, when I\u2019m going to pick up a robe,\" Winfrey explained. \"I think all those people that morning did the same thing, and it was such an ordinary day.\n\n\"I think about everybody who went to that concert the other night,\" she continued. \"It was just an ordinary day and how excited everybody was to be out in the open air and be at that concert. Then they didn\u2019t come home. So, it helps us to \u2014 this is a reminder to all of us \u2014 to appreciate the ordinariness of our days because that\u2019s what makes life extraordinary.\"\n\nWinfrey also praised DeGeneres for her way of lifting viewers' spirits.\n\n\"This is the best I've felt in the past couple of days,\" Winfrey shared, \"being able to spend time with you and come to this show because the one thing that you do \u2014 we all have ways of teaching and healing, and I did it for 25 years on the air \u2014 and I say this with just the deepest love for you, you make everybody feel better.\"\n\nDeGeneres attempted to do just that on Tuesday's Ellen, which was taped Monday.\n\n\"I am hoping we can fill this room with love, and prayers and hope,\" she said at the time to applause. \"My heart is broken for everyone affected by what happened (in Las Vegas). We were just in Las Vegas a few weeks ago and when you think of Las Vegas, it\u2019s a place to escape and have fun and you never imagine anything like this could ever happen.\"\n\nMore:Las Vegas shooter bought 33 guns in last 12 months\n\nMore:Las Vegas shooting: Marilou Danley's relatives speak out\n\nMore:Late night reacts to Las Vegas shooting: Cyrus, Sandler offer duet; Kimmel tears up", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f494050f9a70b57c6d868202f70db525c2b1185e/c=263-331-1341-940/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427038354398035-Rozman-20171003-15022-1655r.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f494050f9a70b57c6d868202f70db525c2b1185e/c=263-331-1341-940/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427038354398035-Rozman-20171003-15022-1655r.jpg?width=1078&height=609&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5596277199001_5596277094001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f494050f9a70b57c6d868202f70db525c2b1185e/c=263-331-1341-940/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427038354398035-Rozman-20171003-15022-1655r.jpg?width=1078&height=609&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/10/04/oprah-calls-las-vegas-shooting-reminder-to-appreciate-ordinariness-our-days/730673001/", "title": "Oprah calls Las Vegas shooting a reminder 'to appreciate the ordinariness of our days'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Oprah calls Las Vegas shooting a reminder 'to appreciate the ordinariness of our days'", "description": "As a guest on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show,' Oprah Winfrey reflects on Sunday's shooting in Las Vegas.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/10/04/oprah-calls-las-vegas-shooting-reminder-to-appreciate-ordinariness-our-days/730673001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f494050f9a70b57c6d868202f70db525c2b1185e/c=263-331-1341-940/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427038354398035-Rozman-20171003-15022-1655r.jpg?width=1078&height=609&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1078, "height": 609}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "As a guest on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show,' Oprah Winfrey reflects on Sunday's shooting in Las Vegas.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f494050f9a70b57c6d868202f70db525c2b1185e/c=263-331-1341-940/local/-/media/2017/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636427038354398035-Rozman-20171003-15022-1655r.jpg?width=1078&height=539&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Oprah calls Las Vegas shooting a reminder 'to appreciate the ordinariness of our days'", "description": "As a guest on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show,' Oprah Winfrey reflects on Sunday's shooting in Las Vegas."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507046400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
