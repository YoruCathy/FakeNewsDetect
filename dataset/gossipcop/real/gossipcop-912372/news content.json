The highly anticipated special issue has become a platform that stretches far beyond celebrating women\u2019s bodies.\n\nModels Paulina Porizkova, 52, Sailor Brinkley Cook, 19, and Robyn Lawley, 28, are proving just that, taking part in a powerful new project called \u201cIn Her Own Words.\u201d Each woman poses completely nude in the issue \u2014 along with more models, which will be revealed when the SI Swim issue drops next week \u2014 with meaningful words like truth, artist, mother, natural and more written across their bodies.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018In Her Own Words\u2019 project is the evolution of the messaging of the SI Swimsuit issue that we have been consistently promoting in the issue for years,\u201d SI Swim editor MJ Daly told PEOPLE. \u201cThe idea of allowing women to celebrate and evolve and harness their own power in a creative environment and allow them a platform to speak to who they truly are and who they want to be.\u201d\n\nDay added: \u201cIt\u2019s so simple, yet so difficult for many in this industry to find control over how their identity is portrayed or interpreted or judged. We want to give this control directly to the women to own their story and image throughout the whole creative process. The results are inspiring.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Paulina Porzikova poses nude for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit\u2019s new \u201cIn Her Own Words\u201d project.\n\nPorzikova, who has been very open about sexual harassment in the modeling industry, landed her first SI Swimsuit cover at the age of 18 in 1984 and covered the issue again the year after, and the model isn\u2019t letting age hold her back from loving her body.\n\nLooking for more style content?

We all have our own truths. We all want to live according to our own truths,\u201d Porzikova told SI. \u201cWe want to be true to ourselves so truth is what matters more than anything.\u201dIn a way, it\u2019s more than being naked.\u201d\n\nRELATED: In Her Own Words: SI Swimsuit Models Celebrate More Than Just Their Bodies in Candid Project\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Christie Brinkley\u2019s Daughter Sailor on Following in Her Mother\u2019s Footsteps\n\nDay knew Porizkova\u2019s legendary status and outspoken personality would make her an amazing powerful addition to the project. \u201cHer non-conformity made me immediately want to approach her about participating in \u2018In Her Own Words,\u201d Day shared. \u201cI knew that if she agreed to do it, just her presence alone would be incredibly important and powerful, and the decision to use her word [\u201cTruth\u201d] punctuated the meaning of the project perfectly.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Sailor Brinkley Cook poses nude for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit\u2019s new \u201cIn Her Own Words\u201d project.\n\nFor Brinkley Cook, who made her SI Swim debut in 2017 alongside her model mom Christie Brinkley and sister Alexa Ray Joel, the experience of writing words and affirmations on her body was a way to combat her own insecurity.\n\n\u201cIt was really special to be a part of this and get to express myself in a very raw, uncensored way,\u201d the model said of taking part in the project. \u201cHaving these words written all over your naked body and having that next level of exposure \u2014 I felt sexy obviously but I felt more emotional and it helped me accept myself.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Robyn Lawley poses nude for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit\u2019s new \u201cIn Her Own Words\u201d project. Taylor Ballantyne/SPORTS ILLUSTRATED\n\nSports Illustrated Swimsuit is bringing female empowerment to the forefront of its Swimsuit Issue this year, and along with the new section of \u201cIn Her Own Words,\u201d the magazine is including more first-person essays from models and highlighting causes that are important to them, like Paige Spiranac\u2019s work with anti-cyberbullying.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: UPDATED!

There is room at the table for everyone and redefining sexy is a great place to start.\u201d\n\nIt was also important for SI Swimsuit\u2019s female editorial team to recruit a female photographer, Taylor Ballantyne, to conceptualize the shoot and \u201cIn Her Own Words Project,\u201d all of which will be detailed in an upcoming TV special which will be airing on Sports Illustrated TV.\n\n\u201cOne of the most common misconceptions about the issue is that it is just for men. Fourteen million women read it,\u201d Day said. \u201cWhen you are doing something as sensitive as nudes like we were this year, having a Taylor shoot it immediately added to the comfort level of the project.\u201d\n\nLawley, who\u2019s spoken about publicly about raising her 2-year-old daughter Ripley in a gender-neutral environment, posed nude for this shoot as an effort to teach her about feeling comfortable in her own skin. \u201cMy daughter is growing up in this world right now and I want her to love who she is because it is so important. If she ever came to me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable in my body, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I would do,\u201d the model admitted to SI.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019d die on the inside. We are women and we are human. We have stretch marks. We have rolls. We have cellulite. That\u2019s all part of our bodies. We become so obsessed with our exterior message; we give no thoughts to what\u2019s in our heads. I just want all those girls out there to know they are so beautiful and so special.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fpaulina-porizkova-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1920&h=1005&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fpaulina-porizkova-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Frobyn-lawley-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fsailor-brinkley-cook-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1920&h=1005&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fpaulina-porizkova-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey", "Brittany Talarico"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/paulina-porizkova-sailor-brinkley-cook-pose-nude-sports-illustrated-swim/", "title": "Paulina Porizkova, Sailor Brinkley Cook Pose Nude for New Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Franchise", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Models,News,Paulina Porizkova,Robyn Lawley,Sailor Brinkley-Cook,SI Swim,Sports Illustrated,Style,Style News", "news_keywords": "Models,News,Paulina Porizkova,Robyn Lawley,Sailor Brinkley-Cook,SI Swim,Sports Illustrated,Style,Style News", "description": "Sports Illustrated is celebrating more than just women's bodies in this year's Swimsuit Issue", "og": {"title": "Paulina Porizkova Poses Nude for SI Swim at 52: 'You Shouldn\u2019t Be Ashamed of Your Body, No Matter What Age You Are'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/paulina-porizkova-sailor-brinkley-cook-pose-nude-sports-illustrated-swim/", "description": "In the wake of the #metoo movement, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models are using this year\u2019s issue as a way to speak out about issues that&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1920&h=1005&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fpaulina-porizkova-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated.jpg", "width": 1920, "height": 1005}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/paulina-porizkova-sailor-brinkley-cook-pose-nude-sports-illustrated-swim/", "description": "Sports Illustrated is celebrating more than just women's bodies in this year's Swimsuit Issue", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fpaulina-porizkova-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/paulina-porizkova-sailor-brinkley-cook-pose-nude-sports-illustrated-swim/", "title": "Paulina Porizkova Poses Nude for SI Swim at 52: 'You Shouldn\u2019t Be Ashamed of Your Body, No Matter What Age You Are'", "description": "Sports Illustrated is celebrating more than just women's bodies in this year's Swimsuit Issue", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1920&h=1005&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fpaulina-porizkova-credit-taylor-ballantyne_sports-illustrated.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
