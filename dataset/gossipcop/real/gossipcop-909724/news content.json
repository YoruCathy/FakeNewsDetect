Find out why Lorde\u2019s getting called OUT on social media. This is why you ALWAYS gotta be reaction-ready for the camera at an awards show. Pink gave a powerful and impassioned performance of her hit song, \u201cWild Hearts Can\u2019t Be Broken\u201d at this year\u2019s Grammy awards, and just in case you missed here, here\u2019s a little taste: Yeah, that\u2019s what you call GIVING IT YOUR ALL, PEOPLE! While Pink was given a huge round of applause for her breathtaking rendition of the song, one member of the crowd who seemed to be less than impressed by Pink was Lorde. The \u201cGreen Light\u201d singer was caught giving barely a golf clap after Pink ended her performance, and that is NOT an exaggeration. Lorde was immediately CALLED OUT by fans on Twitter, with one posting QUOTE, \u201c@lorde \u2018s expression after @Pink performance??? WTH?? Baby claps?? Is there some sort of beef here I don\u2019t know about?? #grammys\u201d and another writing QUOTE, \u201cLorde has no time for Pink #GRAMMYs\u201d. Many others took to the app to question what the deal with Lorde\u2019s reaction to Pink was, and it doesn\u2019t seem like anybody has a logical explanation. One fan called out the incident as QUOTE, \u201cwhite on white crime\u201d and frankly I\u2019m gonna have to agree with them. Lorde what is your deal woman?! Maybe Lorde wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic about Pink killing it because she was still bummed about not getting a solo Grammy performance, herself. It was reported that Lorde refused to perform at the Grammys after she wasn't offered a solo performance, unlike her fellow male nominees. Of course, that\u2019s still no excuse for that miniature golf clap so WHAT GIVES, LORDE?! How about you guys what do you make of Lorde shading Pink with that limp-as-all-hell clap?
