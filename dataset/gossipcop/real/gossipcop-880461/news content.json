He\u2019s eating more \u201creal\u201d food. He avoids junk food. All good, he says.\n\n\u201cBut what often happens with these fad diets is, a little bit of good is wrapped in a blanket of pseudoscience, and the whole package is sold even though there\u2019s no data to support it.\u201d\n\nBrady appears to subscribe to an alkaline diet popularized by Robert O. Young, author of \u201cThe pH Miracle\u201d book series. Young is an American naturopath now facing three years and eight months in a California jail for practising medicine without a licence. According to the BBC, he bought his PhD from a diploma mill.\n\nThe alkaline view is based on the (scientifically discredited) theory people need to consume a diet high in alkaline foods in order to maintain the pH of the blood. If blood becomes too acidic, the hypothesis holds, the body starts leaching calcium and other minerals from the bones, muscles and major organs, and bad things start to happen.\n\nDr. Rena Mendelson begs to differ. Our bodies naturally control our pH levels, says Mendelson, a professor in the school of nutrition at Ryerson University in Toronto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we even need to be conscious of, because our normal homeostatic mechanisms allow us to adapt to a range of different foods or fluids or whatever it is we consume,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHow would the rest of us be walking around and performing well in our day-to-day life if we had to pay attention to the acidity or alkalinity of the foods we consume?\u201d\n\nIf I had Tom Brady\u2019s personal chef I would eat healthy, too\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a diet that\u2019s high in vegetables and whole grain. Eliminating any one food also isn\u2019t a problem, Mendelson says. Strawberries aren\u2019t essential to the diet. Neither are tomatoes.\n\nBut tossing out an entire food group \u2014 nightshades, for example \u2014 can be problematic. Nightshades are high in nutrients, high in the proven Mediterranean diet and are actually anti-inflammatory, says Calgary University registered dietician and epidemiologist Tanis Fenton.\n\nWe don\u2019t need pure sugar. But neither do we need to cut out fruit because it has sugar, she says.\n\nLast year, Fenton published a systematic review of the association between diet acidic load, and cancer. Her conclusion: \u201cAlmost no actual research\u201d exists to prove or disprove these diets for cancer prevention or treatment.\n\nBrady is a phenomenal athlete, Fenton says. \u201cAnd he very modestly is suggesting his diet is the reason, but, no. That\u2019s not good evidence, because it\u2019s a case study \u2013 it\u2019s one individual, and an individual endowed with a wonderful genetic predisposition to be an athlete, obviously. Because diet alone doesn\u2019t make us phenomenal athletes like him.\u201d\n\nStill, Caulfield\u2019s research has shown people subscribe to celebrities over any other source of authority. Celebrity trumps everything.\n\nBrady isn\u2019t alone: Think of swimmer Michael Phelps\u2019 embrace of \u201ccupping\u201d at the Rio games, and super-cold cryotherapy devotee LeBron James. There\u2019s a sociological phenomenon that suggests we can\u2019t help, consciously or not, be influenced by celebrities, Caulfield says. \u201cWe\u2019re all comparison machines \u2014 we can\u2019t help but compare ourselves to others. For most of human history that was a pretty small cohort. Now it\u2019s people like Tom Brady.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have such huge cultural footprint \u2014 they own social media, they own popular culture. We can\u2019t help but hear the things they talk about.\u201d\n\nBut he worries the pseudoscience noise complicates the story about how to live a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIt makes it sound like eating healthy is hard and expensive. People will go, \u201cif I had Tom Brady\u2019s personal chef I would eat healthy, too.\u2019 And that\u2019s a terrible message,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEating healthy doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\u201d", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0",
