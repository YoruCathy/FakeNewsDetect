A segment on a Dutch game show called Neem Je Zwemspullen Mee (Bring Your Bathing Suit) asks male contestants to guess whether women are fat or pregnant, and the internet is none too pleased about the misogynistic premise.\n\nThe shocking episode aired in the Netherlands on Sunday, April 9, and, already, many are petitioning to have the show taken off the air for good. This isn\u2019t the first time the series has stirred up controversy. Last year, Bring Your Bathing Suit made headlines when contestants were asked to guess whether a person was Japanese or Chinese, and if a woman\u2019s breasts were real.\n\n\u201cFor everyone thinking The Netherlands is great. We reached a new low yesterday night. National TV game show: \u2018is she pregnant or just fat?'\u201d one angry viewer wrote on Twitter, while another fumed: \u201cWelcome to the Netherlands, where we apparently have a tv show where men guess if a woman\u2019s fat or pregnant. I f\u2013king can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn response to the backlash, the series has done away with the insensitive segment, according to DutchNews.nl. \u201cThe section Fat or Pregnant? was meant to show appearances can deceive. In this round we feature lots of prejudices based on what people look like,\u201d show director Yvonne de Haan said in a statement. \u201cIs he a criminal or a business man?, or is he Dutch or German? Putting things in a satirical setting is a way of laughing at prejudice. But we did it in a way that hurt people. That was never the intention and we regret it.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fat-or-pregnant-zoom-09b64d3b-e92d-446b-8b79-2fa0fe0a76cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C838px%2C440px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fat-or-pregnant-zoom-09b64d3b-e92d-446b-8b79-2fa0fe0a76cf.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C836px%2C470px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fat-or-pregnant-zoom-09b64d3b-e92d-446b-8b79-2fa0fe0a76cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C838px%2C440px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/dutch-game-show-has-men-guess-if-women-are-fat-or-pregnant-w476902/", "title": "Dutch Game Show Has Men Guess If Women Are Fat or Pregnant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "A segment on a Dutch game show called \u2018Neem Je Zwemspullen Mee (Bring Your Bathing Suit)\u2019 asks male contestants to guess whether women are fat or pregnant, and the internet is none too pleased about the episode\u2019s misogynistic premise \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dutch Game Show Has Men Guess If Women Are Fat or Pregnant", "description": "A segment on a Dutch game show called \u2018Neem Je Zwemspullen Mee (Bring Your Bathing Suit)\u2019 asks male contestants to guess whether women are fat or pregnant, and the internet is none too pleased about the episode\u2019s misogynistic premise \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/dutch-game-show-has-men-guess-if-women-are-fat-or-pregnant-w476902/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:15:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fat-or-pregnant-zoom-09b64d3b-e92d-446b-8b79-2fa0fe0a76cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C838px%2C440px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fat-or-pregnant-zoom-09b64d3b-e92d-446b-8b79-2fa0fe0a76cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C838px%2C440px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-14T18:03:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:15:43+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A segment on a Dutch game show called \u2018Neem Je Zwemspullen Mee (Bring Your Bathing Suit)\u2019 asks male contestants to guess whether women are fat or pregnant, and the internet is none too pleased about the episode\u2019s misogynistic premise \u2014 read more", "title": "Dutch Game Show Has Men Guess If Women Are Fat or Pregnant", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fat-or-pregnant-zoom-09b64d3b-e92d-446b-8b79-2fa0fe0a76cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C838px%2C440px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492192980.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
