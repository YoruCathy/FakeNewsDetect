The actress opened up about it in a recent interview\u2014and her sentiments will ring true for many women out there.\n\nMore and more women are in similar positions to Kirsten: They're working hard and focused on their careers, and they don't necessarily feel the need to experience motherhood in their twenties or early thirties. But Kirsten, who is 35, developed a case of \"baby fever,\" and feels ready to become a mom herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at a stage in my life where I\u2019m like, I\u2019ve been working since I was three. It\u2019s time to have babies and chill,\u201d the actress told Marie Claire U.K. \u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those \u2018I need a baby!\u2019 people until my goddaughter was born. I love her so much...That love is just like\u2026 you can\u2019t experience that unless you have a kid.\"\n\nThere are plenty of people out there who will tell ya: That baby fever can strike at any time (or any age\u2014it's 2017, we can have kids whenever we feel ready for it!), and once it does, it can be pretty intense...even if you were never someone who dreamed of nursery decor or brainstormed baby names.\n\nKirsten is engaged to partner Jesse Plemons\u2014and who knows? Maybe the two have both a child and a wedding in their future plans.\n\nCan you relate to what Kirsten has to say about wanting children? Was there one specific thing (or person!) that brought on a case of baby fever for you?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://images.meredith.com/fpg/images/Marketing/Registration/OnsiteDefaults/300x150_12420_NW_FPGNW.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://images.fitpregnancy.mdpcdn.com/sites/fitpregnancy.com/files/styles/width_360/public/shutterstock_567433645.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://images.meredith.com/fpg/images/Marketing/Registration/OnsiteDefaults/200x100_12420_NW_FPGNW.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://images.fitpregnancy.mdpcdn.com/sites/fitpregnancy.com/files/styles/scale_1500_1500/public/shutterstock_567433645.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://images.fitpregnancy.mdpcdn.com/sites/fitpregnancy.com/files/styles/scale_1500_1500/public/shutterstock_567433645.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zara Husaini Hanawalt"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736/https://www.fitpregnancy.com/parenting/celebrity/kirsten-dunst-has-baby-fever-its-time-to-have-babies-and-chill", "title": "Kirsten Dunst Has Baby Fever: 'It's Time to Have Babies and Chill'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "FacebookShareMessage": "Kirsten Dunst gets real about baby fever...and you just might be able to relate to what she's feeling.", "mdp": {"contentType": "story"}, "description": "Kirsten Dunst opened up about wanting to become a mother after a lifetime of not being \"one of those 'I need a baby!' people.\"", "fb": {"admins": 1561750258, "app_id": 196109807392227}, "og": {"site_name": "Fit Pregnancy and Baby", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736/https://www.fitpregnancy.com/parenting/celebrity/kirsten-dunst-has-baby-fever-its-time-to-have-babies-and-chill", "title": "Kirsten Dunst Has Baby Fever: 'It's Time to Have Babies and Chill'", "description": "Kirsten Dunst opened up about wanting to become a mother after a lifetime of not being \"one of those 'I need a baby!' people.\"", "updated_time": "2017-06-01T16:52:10-0400", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170602010736im_/https://images.fitpregnancy.mdpcdn.com/sites/fitpregnancy.com/files/styles/scale_1500_1500/public/shutterstock_567433645.jpg"}, "article": {"section": "Parenting", "tag": "Getting Pregnant", "published_time": "2017-06-01T16:26:47-0400", "modified_time": "2017-06-01T16:52:10-0400"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496348807.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
