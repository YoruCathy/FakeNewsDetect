His acknowledgment came as a film distributor canceled the release of his forthcoming comedy and as media companies cut ties with him in response to a New York Times report in which the women detailed his behavior toward them.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Louis C.K. said, \u201cI want to address the stories told to The New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThese stories are true.\u201d\n\n[Read the statement from Louis C.K.]\n\nIn the Times report, the comedians Dana Min Goodman, Julia Wolov and Rebecca Corry, the writer Abby Schachner, and a fifth woman who spoke on condition of anonymity described upsetting interactions with Louis C.K. in which he undressed and masturbated in front of them, asked if he could masturbate in front of them, or could be heard masturbating during a telephone call.\n\nLouis C.K. said in his statement that he told himself \u201cwhat I did was O.K.\u201d because he asked the women first. But, he continued, he learned \u201ctoo late\u201d that \u201cwhen you have power over another person,\u201d such a request \u201cisn\u2019t a question.
