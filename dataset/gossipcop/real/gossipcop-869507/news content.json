In August 2018 he shared on social media that a plant based diet helped him shed 51 more pounds after he suffered a heart attack earlier in the year.

Hide Caption 4 of 24\n\nPhotos: Celebrity transformations Jonah Hill fans immediately noticed the actor's new summer bod for 2017 and applauded his fit overhaul as inspiring.

Perhaps that's because the \"Bridget Jones\" star has spent less time in the public eye recently; her last film credit was in 2010. That should change soon: Zellweger's next film, \"The Whole Truth,\" is due in 2015. Hide Caption 20 of 24\n\nPhotos: Celebrity transformations Hip-hop artist Missy Elliott proved she can still work it as she flaunted a slimmed-down figure in October 2014 at the launch of designer Alexander Wang's line for H&M.

Hide Caption 21 of 24\n\nPhotos: Celebrity transformations Tom Arnold has lost about 90 pounds since his first child was born in 2013, and he was looking quite thin at the 2014 South by Southwest festival.

After his son was born, he knew he needed to make a lasting change. \"I saw that little baby, and I thought, 'I gotta stay alive for as long as possible,' \" Arnold said. \"That's a lifelong commitment.\" Hide Caption 22 of 24\n\nPhotos: Celebrity transformations Jessica Simpson showed off a supersvelte look in a Weight Watchers ad released in February 2014. \"I was so insecure -- I couldn't even believe what I weighed,\" Simpson told \"Good Morning America.\" The singer/fashion mogul says she is feeling better than ever since giving birth to her second child.
