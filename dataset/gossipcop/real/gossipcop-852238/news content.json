Because out of everyone the \"Hollywood Medium\" has turned back time for, it's you he's got his heart set on reading!\n\nTODAY sat down with the 20-year-old star of reality TV show \"Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry\" to get the inside scoop on his psychic readings ahead of his book launch for \"Between Two Worlds.\"\n\nHenry has conducted readings for a number of celebrities \u2014 Ross Matthews, Jodie Sweetin and Margaret Cho, just to name a few. But it's Cher and Lana Del Ray who are among the list of stars he would do anything to read.\n\nAnd he may be young, but don't let his age fool you. Henry discovered his gift nearly 10 years ago when he had a premonition of his grandmother's passing, and he's been refining his craft ever since.\n\nRELATED: Matt Lauer's emotional sit-down with Tyler Henry: 'My hands were shaking'\n\n\"I had gone into the room to tell my mom she was going to die and before we got the chance to actually walk out the door, my mom\u2019s phone rang and it was my dad on the other end saying my grandmother had just passed,\" Henry told TODAY.\n\nCourtesy of Tyler Henry\n\nWhile he initially had plans to work in the medical field, Henry ended up finding a way to combine both his passion for helping people and his desire to deliver messages from beyond.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

The medium is constantly leaning on all five senses to gather information.\n\n\"In a reading, I might hear a voice, see an image or even get a physical sensation that corresponds with how someone passed,\" he said.\n\nThat can be hugely draining, especially when the sensation is that of a heart attack or stroke.\n\n\"Doing readings is so gratifying that it makes any physical intensity worth it for me,\" he said.\n\nReadings can last anywhere from one to four hours, Henry says, but there are other signs people can look out for when a lost loved one is trying to communicate.\n\n\"Dreams, I would say, are probably the most prevalent way a loved one will try to deliver a message,\" he said. \"Oftentimes reoccurring dreams are ways a loved one is trying to come through and deliver a message.\"\n\nBut there's very little warning when a dream will pop up. And similarly, Henry never really knows what information he'll receive during a reading.\n\nRELATED: Have you seen a ghost? There may be a medical reason\n\n\"I\u2019m not really in control of the messages that come through,\" he said. \"A mailman isn\u2019t responsible for what mail he gives.\"\n\nThat is one of the many things Henry has learned on the job. But at the end of the day, his goal is simply to connect a person with their lost loved one.\n\nWhile it's been a whirlwind journey to becoming the \"Hollywood Medium,\" the experience has also proved to be incredibly rewarding.\n\n\"I would just say take it one day at a time,\" said Henry. \"It's so easy to get wrapped up in life and I think that for me, just being in the present has been such an important part of getting through all of this, and it\u2019s been amazing.\"", "images":
