A little over a decade ago, listeners became acquainted with the singer through the video for \"Our Song,\" which was released in 2006; in it, she wears a frilly lilac prom dress for its entirety.\n\nSwift mostly stayed along that stylistic straight-and-narrow throughout the 11 years since: light colors, poofy skirts, lots of sparkle, and nothing at all risqu\u00e9. She was partial to the work of KaufmanFranco and J.Mendel, both award show favorites. She made it a point to not wear high-end designers in her early music videos, so that her audience could relate. Eventually, though, as her music matured, so did her wardrobe, and she began calling in Valentino and Dior. Though, in a Glamour cover story from 2014, she did say she still wasn't inclined to wear fur, animal print, spiked clothing, or boxy shoulders.\n\nTaylor Swift wearing a purple prom dress in the \"Our Song\" music video. Big Machine Records\n\nEveryone's styles evolve as they grow older. Swift's is no exception. (And she's talked about it.) The difference is that her entire musical career has been built on wearing her heart on her sleeve and, well, caring. Her relatability reached audiences through her vulnerable lyrics and outfits that, while certainly expensive, weren't exclusively couture. (Her side-business enterprises included, among other things, an affordable sundress line with Walmart.) Over the years, this approach has attracted criticism of appearing too \"calculated,\"a word she hates according to her GQ cover story from 2015. But she's admitted to using her outfits as a way to maintain that squeaky-clean image she put forth through her music: She once told the Guardian that being perceived as sexy was \"not really on [her] radar.\"\n\nIn her music videos, her costumes reinforced themes in her music, such as in the climactic moment in \u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d when Swift's nerdy protagonist shows up to the prom in a beautiful white dress to win over the subject of her affection; or in \u201cTeardrops On My Guitar,\u201d when she lounges at home in a blue evening gown while musing about unjust heartbreak; or in \u201cLove Story,\u201d when she literally wore a medieval ball gown while playing the Juliet to an actor's Romeo. Across the truly wide spectrum of situations the singer found herself depicted in these videos, Swift illustrated her music's concepts (and portrayed herself) in demure but dreamy dresses as her star began to rise.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f3986a8c6db22bfab3de41/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-outfit-shot-1.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33d37f67f7204bb561a6f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-our-song-dress.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33ddbad714a335821fcda/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/o-BAD-BLOOD-facebook.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33d945b645f2e900dd93d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-10-25%252520at%2525204.30.13%252520PM.png", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33d66ad714a335821fcd8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-you-belong-with-me-dress.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33ccc5b645f2e900dd93b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/13-taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-screenshot-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33db8f67f7204bb561a71/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/rehost-2016-9-13-78ce6871-4ba2-46e3-a49f-43416088e61f.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33dffd60b30611849af5d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/07-taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-screenshot-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f397d85b645f2e900dd966/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-lede-image.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f398b55b645f2e900dd968/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/two-taylors-ready-for-it.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33cf7ad714a335821fcd6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/06-taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-screenshot-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1506636472/glamour_14-facts-about-cardi-b.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f397ecd945514f9f01d824/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-social.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33c695b645f2e900dd939/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Reputation-Taylor-Swift.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33ca5558b186fd1bcdc75/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-music-video-01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f397ecd945514f9f01d824/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Halie Lesavage", "Halie Lesavag"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-fashion-reputation-music-videos", "title": "How Taylor Swift is Counting on Fashion to Change Her 'Reputation'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Halie LeSavage", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Taylor Swift has adopted a distinct look with each phase in her career.
