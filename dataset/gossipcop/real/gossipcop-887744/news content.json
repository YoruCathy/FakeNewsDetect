At the event, women spoke about sexual abuse they\u2019ve faced in their lives.\n\nDern\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d co-star Reese Witherspoon revealed she was sexually assaulted by a director when she was just 16; Jennifer Lawrence recalled being made to stand in a \u201cdegrading\u201d nude lineup for an audition.\n\n\u201cIt was an extraordinary experience, perhaps more than ever, to have this shared space and a tribe of women and artists talking about this industry, and ultimately therefore talking about sexual harassment in the workplace,\u201d Dern said.\n\nThe actress told DeGeneres she had a revelation Tuesday morning, realizing she, too, had been \u201cjustifying behavior\u201d that was not OK.\n\nStefanie Keenan via Getty Images\n\n\u201c ... I talked about how I was one of the lucky ones because I was raised by actors who told me their stories and told me what to look out for, and I realized that I was I still justifying behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was my mom who said, \u2018No, no, no, Laura, that was sexual assault. That was harassment. That was assault. No, you were 14 then.\u2019 And you realize how in our culture we have justified, and therefore even condoned, behavior as though it\u2019s the norm. I felt very moved by people being honest and direct.\u201d\n\nDern said that for her the \u201cmost exciting\u201d part is moving forward through action, including the possible formation of a commission where woman can report \u2015 even anonymously \u2015 abuses of power.\n\nKathleen Kennedy wants to create a Hollywood commission with a zero-tolerance policy about sexual abuse.
