Helping them with their journey are Dr. Michelle R. Callahan (The Tyra Banks Show) and Yoanna House (America's Next Top Model). In the end, the girl with the most dramatic change wins a $25,000 cash prize.\n\nAt the end of each week, the girls' progress is recorded on a Progress Report for all to see. Each girl is tracked with gold stars, each star being earned as positive reinforcement. The girl with the least progress at the end of the week is put on notice and threatened with expulsion. If a girl fails to change at all, she is sent home.\n\nIn the house, there are two special rooms: the \"Secret Room\" and the Conference Room. The Conference Room is a special room used for weekly group therapy session and one-on-one sessions with Dr. Michelle.
