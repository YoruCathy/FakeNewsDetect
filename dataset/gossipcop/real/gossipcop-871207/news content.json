Right. Such is the case with new peanut butter and jelly Oreos, the long-awaited flavor mash-up that somehow slipped through the cracks when gag-worthy iterations like candy corn, banana split, and cotton candy rolled out first.\n\nNews of the cookies broke when notorious junk food leaker @JunkBanter posted a shot of the presumed packaging to Instagram on Wednesday.\n\nThough the product has yet to be officially confirmed by Nabisco, it appears that the limited edition flavor will be exclusive to Kroger (which isn\u2019t too far-fetched, considering last year\u2019s Swedish Fish atrocity was also exclusive to the Southern grocery store chain.)\n\nNeedless to say, we haven\u2019t been this excited about a new Oreo type since the Pop Rock-heavy Firework variety that debuted this summer. We\u2019re just concerned about the choice in jelly, seeing as there is a huge difference between grape and strawberry (the latter being the best option, obviously).\n\nTaking a page out of Lay\u2019s \u201cDo Us a Flavor\u201d competition, Oreo has also debuted the #MyOreoCreation contest which encourages fans from around the country to submit ideas for new Oreo flavors. Consumers can submit ideas by simply using the hashtag #MyOreoCreation on Instagram or Twitter, with the winner receiving $500,000 and the title of Oreo VIP (aka our dream job). From cannoli and avocado to nacho cheese and tutti frutti, clearly no idea is too out of the ordinary. In fact, a savory Oreo doesn\u2019t sound like the worst idea. It\u2019s all just a matter of texture (which already has us thinking of Combos, for some reason).\n\nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing, Oreo. But by keep doing what you\u2019re doing, what we really mean is stick to the classics and don\u2019t get too creative. We\u2019ll take peanut butter anything over some obnoxiously-flavored fad candy any day.\n\nRelated Video: Next-Level Grilled Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwiches", "images": ["https://chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/thumbnail/80/0/chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/blog-media/2017/08/peanut-butter-jelly-oreos-chowhound-670x478.png?q=10", "https://chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/s/ch-finger.png", "https://chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/thumbnail/80/0/chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/blog-media/2017/08/oreo-chowhound-670x408.jpg?q=10", "https://chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/thumbnail/1200/0/chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/blog-media/2017/08/peanut-butter-jelly-oreos-chowhound-1.png"], "top_img": "https://chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/thumbnail/1200/0/chowhound1.cbsistatic.com/blog-media/2017/08/peanut-butter-jelly-oreos-chowhound-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.chowhound.com/food-news/186598/peanut-butter-and-jelly-oreos/", "title": "Peanut Butter and Jelly Oreos Exist and Here\u2019s How You Can Get Them", "meta_data": {"description": "It only makes sense for America's favorite sandwich cookie to imitate America's favorite sandwich, right?
