Watts wore all black in support of the Time\u2019s Up movement, while Crudup went tie-less in a white shirt and grey suit. The pair's interlocked fingers were hard to miss as they left the bash.\n\nBackgrid\n\nWatts split from her ex-husband, Liev Schreiber, in September 2016. The couple had been together for 11 years and share two children, Samuel and Alexander.\n\nCrudup has a 14-year-old son, William, from a previous relationship with actress Mary Louise Parker, and has also dated Claire Danes.\n\nSee more on the 2018 BAFTAs below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Naomi Watts Talks Incredible Friendship With Nicole Kidman: 'We've Been Through Stuff Together'\n\nNEWS: Naomi Watts Reportedly Dating 'Gypsy' Co-Star Billy Crudup\n\nNEWS: Mary-Louise Parker Finally Opens Up About Billy Crudup Leaving Her for Claire Danes\n\nKate Middleton, Jennifer Lawrence and More Stars Wow on the Red Carpet During 2018 BAFTAs This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
