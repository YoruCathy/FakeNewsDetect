Since then, we\u2019ve grown to be a culture-centric, lifestyle brand that provides craveable, affordable Mexican-inspired food with bold flavors. Not only do we provide breakthrough value, we offer quality ingredients and are the first QSR restaurant to offer American Vegetarian Association (AVA)-certified menu items.\n\nTaco Bell and our more than 350 franchise organizations operate over 7,000 restaurants that serve more than 40 million customers each week in the U.S. Internationally, the brand is growing with nearly 500 restaurants across almost 30 countries across the globe.\n\nWe provide educational opportunities and serve the community through our nonprofit organization, the Taco Bell Foundation, and support fans and team members with their passions through programs such as the Live M\u00e1s Scholarship. We provide access to sports, gaming and new music through our Feed The Beat program.\n\nOutside of our restaurants, fans can access Taco Bell through our mobile app, desktop on Ta.co and delivery through our partnership with Grubhub. Taco Bell became the first QSR to launch a mobile app in U.S. restaurants for both drive-thru and dining orders. In 2016, we were named as one of Fast Company\u2019s Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in the World.\n\nTo learn more about Taco Bell, please visit www.tacobell.com.", "images": ["https://www.tacobell.com/wps/wcm/connect/yumbrands/37ba42de-a439-4593-a1fe-89930df10aca/investors-menu.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_2Q82H202O02550QCJUO2J60000-37ba42de-a439-4593-a1fe-89930df10aca-mCn7meW", "https://www.tacobell.com/wps/contenthandler/yumbrands/!ut/p/digest!RpbGIMAgQ4_o7xtWiMpRaw/dav/fs-type1/themes/yumdotcomtheme2019/images/favicon.ico", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.tacobell.com/wps/wcm/connect/yumbrands/4ee982b2-d2e5-40e4-b9e4-6f001f17779e/menu-careers-c.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_2Q82H202O02550QCJUO2J60000-4ee982b2-d2e5-40e4-b9e4-6f001f17779e-mCtlsqT", "https://www.tacobell.com/wps/wcm/connect/yumbrands/a161009a-ed61-429e-9e11-6aa52cd96888/menu-citizenship.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_2Q82H202O02550QCJUO2J60000-a161009a-ed61-429e-9e11-6aa52cd96888-mt-.EMg", "https://www.tacobell.com/wps/wcm/connect/yumbrands/fa5b26bd-8d2c-43df-81e4-f43c18ec1ee8/menu-company.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_2Q82H202O02550QCJUO2J60000-fa5b26bd-8d2c-43df-81e4-f43c18ec1ee8-mt-.jnE", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1171706&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2235435516583288&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.tacobell.com/wps/wcm/connect/yumbrands/9c6f619b-8840-4a59-8fdf-b7d87d0c1539/menu-news.jpg?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_2Q82H202O02550QCJUO2J60000-9c6f619b-8840-4a59-8fdf-b7d87d0c1539-mt-.Qr7"], "top_img": "https://www.tacobell.com/wps/contenthandler/yumbrands/!ut/p/digest!RpbGIMAgQ4_o7xtWiMpRaw/dav/fs-type1/themes/yumdotcomtheme2019/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Taco Bell", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#39bdb5", "msapplication-TileImage": "mstile-144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.tacobell.com", "summary": ""}
