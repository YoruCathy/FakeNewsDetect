So much of it is not from dialogue or anything we wrote. It's just the two of them in a small space, standing near each other, and us just watching that and feeling the heat of it,\" Benioff said.\n\n\n\nTalking about Daenerys, co-creator D.B. Weiss added, \"She's in a position where if she doesn't step up soon and come up with a big win for her side, she's going to lose this fight before it even begins.\u201d\n\n\"I think she really feels the pressure of her situation more than she ever has before. It's the fight she's been waiting for her whole life,\" he continued.", "images": ["https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/logo/nie_logo_600X390.jpg", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/Android_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/YT_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/8/w600X300/kit_harrington_emilia_clarke_game_of_thrones.jpg", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-article/mail.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-article/twitter.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/twitter_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/logo/nie_logo_600X300.jpg", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/new_logo.jpg", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-article/fb.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/rss_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/8/w600X390/kit_harrington_emilia_clarke_game_of_thrones.jpg", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/gallery-icon.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=16833363&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/Insta_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/Fb_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-article/flip.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com//images/FrontEnd/images/social-icon-set/Apple_new.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/loader-Nie.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/images/FrontEnd/images/search-mob.png", "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/play-circle.png"], "top_img": "https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/8/w600X390/kit_harrington_emilia_clarke_game_of_thrones.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/english/2017/aug/08/game-of-thrones-boss-david-benioff-discusses-jon-snow-daenerys-complicated-attraction-1640106.html", "title": "Game of Thrones boss David Benioff discusses Jon Snow, Daenerys' complicated attraction- The New Indian Express", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Game of Thrones boss David Benioff discusses Jon Snow, Daenerys' complicated\u00a0attraction", "description": "Talking about Daenerys, co-creator D.B.
