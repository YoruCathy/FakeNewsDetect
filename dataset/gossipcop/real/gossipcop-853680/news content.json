Then Mom Gomez knocks on the door, and Daughter Gomez pretends to be asleep on the bed. When she\u2019s alone again, she takes a Polaroid out, caressing it lovingly. The picture is of another Selena character \u2014 but you\u2019ll have to watch to find out which one.\n\nAdding to the mystery is a title card at the very end that says \u201cCOMING SOON / FETISH\u201d \u2014 a sun-kissed Gomez mouths the latter directly to the camera \u2014 hinting that a new single or album might be on its way.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fselena-gomez-bad-liar-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fselena-gomez-bad-liar-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Heching"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2017/06/14/selena-gomez-music-video-bad-liar/", "title": "Selena Gomez travels to the '70s in new 'Bad Liar' video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Selena Gomez", "news_keywords": "Selena Gomez", "description": "Selena Gomez dropped the music video for her new single 'Bad Liar' on Wednesday, in which she plays four separate roles.
