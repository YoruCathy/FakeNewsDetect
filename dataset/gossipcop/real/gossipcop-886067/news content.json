All four of her grandparents are from Jalisco, Mexico, while her parents and most of her family were born in the US.[8] Gomez has two brothers, and a younger sister.[9] In December 2017, she revealed she has a half-sister who was eighteen years old.[10] Gomez grew up in Moreno Valley, and at the age of nine her family lost their home and moved into the converted garage of her grandparents' house due to financial problems.[1] Gomez began working part-time jobs to help support her family, doing commercials and voice over work.[1] She had what she described as a \"mid-life crisis\" when she was nine years old, and decided she wanted to pursue a music career.[1] She was quoted as stating \"That was literally my mid-life crisis when I was nine years old. That's when I felt like, 'OK, I gotta get my life together. What am I gonna do?' I pushed that on myself at a younger age than the average kid because at the time my family had lost our home. I've always been more mature for my age, so I was already understanding what they were going through. And I just thought, 'How can I help them?'\"[11] She initially attended public school, though had to undergo home schooling due to issues with bullying.[11] She claimed that at one point she was jumped by multiple girls while in the restroom, and was a frequent target due to her jobs in the entertainment industry.[12]\n\nGomez appeared in the short film El Tux (2008) as Claudia G\u00f3mez and as Nina in the Discovery Channel television film La estaci\u00f3n de la Calle Olvera (2008).[13][14] She became a member of a girl group named G.L.A.M. in 2009,[15][16] and later joined B.C.G., another girl group.[17] She filmed a music video as part of G.L.A.M. for a song titled \"JellyBean\" in 2009.

I was 100 percent in. She has so much personality and her voice just pops out of the speakers. Then I met her and discovered she could also sing and play the guitar and I thought, 'This is even better.' Then I found out she could write and it was like, 'What else are you going to tell me, that you\u2019re also Van Gogh?' Her potential is limitless.\"[12] Shortly after signing with the label, Gomez began work on her debut album.[1]\n\n2012\u20132015: Commercial success with music and acting [ edit ]\n\nIn August, while working on her debut album, Gomez released her first song, \"Problem\", featuring will.i.am, which was subsequently remixed into \"Problem (The Monster Remix)\" in September, for the Sony Pictures Animation film Hotel Transylvania; the song served as a promotional single and also appeared in the movie in the end credits.[18] Gomez and will.i.am filmed a music video for the song; it features both artists in a hotel while scenes from the movie also appear.[1] She is featured on Cody Simpson's song \"Wish U Were Here\" (2012), serviced as the second single from his debut studio album on August 7.[19] She worked with Cher Lloyd on the song \"Oath\", released on October 2 as the fourth single from her debut album.[20] The single had some commercial success, becoming Gomez's first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[21] The track was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of 500,000 copies in the country.[22] She also worked with Michel Tel\u00f3 on a remix of his song \"Ai Se Eu Te Pego\" on his UK EP on October 14.
