News reports. At one point, Kutcher put his arm around his wife's waist and whispered something in her ear that made her giggle.\n\nKimberly White / Getty Images\n\nThe lovebirds met as co-stars on \"That '70s Show\" back in 1998, but didn't fall for each other until more than a decade later.\n\nIn fact, in July 2016, Kunis revealed to late-night host James Corden that she always thought of Kutcher as just a pal who once helped her with her chemistry homework on set \u2014 until she caught a glimpse of him from behind at an awards ceremony years later.\n\n\"At first I was like, 'Wow, that guy's really tall.' That's what I thought. Then he turned around and I went, 'Huh!'\" Kunis recalled.\n\n\"That moment you hear or see in movies where your heart skips a beat \u2014 and it happened with Ashton,\" she explained. \"I was, like, 'Stop it!' ... It was the weirdest thing. I was, like, 'This isn't really happening.'\"\n\nWell, it did happen. And we're so glad!", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_pop_mila_171011.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301369/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-today-171204-tease_1198f0700d38c72fd27b3680fd197479.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301369/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-today-171204-tease_1198f0700d38c72fd27b3680fd197479.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/mila-ashton-walk-first-red-carpet-together-70s-show-t119615", "title": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher walk 1st red carpet together since 'That '70s Show'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/mila-ashton-walk-first-red-carpet-together-70s-show-t119615", "title": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher walk 1st red carpet together since 'That '70s Show'", "description": "The pair, who married in 2015 and have two kids, hit the red carpet for the very first time as a couple.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301369/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-today-171204-tease_1198f0700d38c72fd27b3680fd197479.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301369/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-today-171204-tease_1198f0700d38c72fd27b3680fd197479.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301369/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-today-171204-tease_1198f0700d38c72fd27b3680fd197479.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher walk 1st red carpet together since 'That '70s Show'", "description": "The pair, who married in 2015 and have two kids, hit the red carpet for the very first time as a couple.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The pair, who married in 2015 and have two kids, hit the red carpet for the very first time as a couple.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1301369/mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher-today-171204-tease_1198f0700d38c72fd27b3680fd197479.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512421380.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
