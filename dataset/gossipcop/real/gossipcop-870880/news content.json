Demi Lovato appeared on iHeartRadio\u2019s \u201cLabel Defiers\u201d podcast with Elvis Duran on Tuesday, August 1, to discuss how she feels about labels she often receives.\n\nThe pop star, 24, revealed that there\u2019s one designation in particular that bothers her. \u201cI think when people refer to me as being bipolar, it\u2019s something that\u2019s true \u2014 I am bipolar \u2014 but I don\u2019t like people to use it as a label,\u201d Lovato said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I have. It\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBody Say\u201d singer added that there are some labels she wouldn\u2019t mind. \u201cI think Demi Lovato, activist, is something I\u2019d really be proud of,\u201d she said.\n\nLovato has been outspoken about living with mental illness. In 2011, she sought treatment for an eating disorder, depression and self-harm, and she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\nNow, the former Disney star is doing well. \u201cI\u2019m in a really, really good space,\u201d she told Duran. \u201cI\u2019m in a place in my life where I feel like I\u2019ve learned so much and I\u2019m going to continue to learn. I feel like I\u2019m just smack dab in the middle of my journey.\u201d\n\nThe singer has been using her platform to help raise awareness for mental health issues. \u201cIt\u2019s important to speak up about the things you believe in, because your voice will be heard no matter what position you\u2019re in,\u201d she shared. \u201cI just happen to be in a position where more people would hear my voice than they would have 10-15 years ago, so I use my voice to do more than just sing.\u201d\n\nLovato has previously been open about living with bipolar disorder. She told 20/20 in 2011 that she had \u201cno idea\u201d she was bipolar until she received treatment for other issues. \u201cI was actually manic a lot of the times that I would take on workloads, and I would say, \u2018Yes, I can do this, I can do this, I can do this,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was conquering the world, but then I would come crashing down, and I would be more depressed than ever.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-d9e9795c-4e2e-4d12-93e4-1bb376720c3f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1012px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-d9e9795c-4e2e-4d12-93e4-1bb376720c3f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-d9e9795c-4e2e-4d12-93e4-1bb376720c3f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/demi-lovato-doesnt-want-to-be-labeled-as-bipolar-w495638/", "title": "Demi Lovato Doesn\u2019t Want to Be Labeled as Bipolar", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Demi Lovato revealed that she doesn\u2019t like when people label her as being bipolar \u2014 see what she said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Demi Lovato Doesn\u2019t Want to Be Labeled as Bipolar", "description": "Demi Lovato revealed that she doesn\u2019t like when people label her as being bipolar \u2014 see what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/demi-lovato-doesnt-want-to-be-labeled-as-bipolar-w495638/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:45:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-d9e9795c-4e2e-4d12-93e4-1bb376720c3f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-d9e9795c-4e2e-4d12-93e4-1bb376720c3f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-02T20:41:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:45:30+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Demi Lovato revealed that she doesn\u2019t like when people label her as being bipolar \u2014 see what she said", "title": "Demi Lovato Doesn\u2019t Want to Be Labeled as Bipolar", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demi-lovato-d9e9795c-4e2e-4d12-93e4-1bb376720c3f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501706460.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
