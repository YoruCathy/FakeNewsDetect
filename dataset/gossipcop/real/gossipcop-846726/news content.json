And while Jennifer has built an impressive acting career \u2014 Selena and The Wedding Planner are classics \u2014 she also deserves a moment of appreciation for her ~fierce~ red-carpet contributions.\n\nAs seen last night.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe 47-year-old wore a dress from Welsh designer Julien Macdonald's fall 2017 ready-to-wear collection \u2014 if you could even call it a dress.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHow does it stay up? How does it stay put? What is this garment made of? Is it itchy? Did assistants glue each stripe of fabric to her before she stepped out of the car? Did she even take a car, or was she simply whisked to the event by strapping, hunky angels?\n\nThese are not hypothetical questions.\n\nGetty Images\n\nShe completed the look with earrings by Lynn Ban, peep-toe heels by Jimmy Choo, and a slicked-back ponytail by stylist Chris Appleton, according to People.\n\n\n\nIn case her first dress didn't adequately unhinge your jaw, Jennifer changed into a second Julien Macdonald outfit later in the night. It, too, left little to the imagination.\n\nGetty Images\n\nYou could spend time lamenting the fact that you don't get to be J.Lo or that no other human looks like this \u2014 or you could just be grateful for her existence. The world seems a little more OK with this woman in it.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.899xw:0.897xh;0.0449xw,0.103xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.899xw:0.897xh;0.0449xw,0.103xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlin Menza", "Kaitlin Menza Is A Freelance Features Writer."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a9575887/jennifer-lopez-latin-billboards/", "title": "We Are Living for Jennifer Lopez's Latest Outfit", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "We Are Living for Jennifer Lopez's Latest Outfit", "description": "\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a9575887/jennifer-lopez-latin-billboards/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.899xw:0.897xh;0.0449xw,0.103xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2017-10-04 06:41:08", "published_time": "2017-04-28 04:06:00", "section": "Style", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.899xw:0.897xh;0.0449xw,0.103xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Outfit at Billboard Latin Music Awards", "description": "\ud83d\udd25\u00a0\ud83d\udd25\u00a0\ud83d\udd25", "keywords": "Jennifer Lopez", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.504xw:1.00xh;0.249xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Beauty & Style,style-beauty,fashion,Jennifer Lopez", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-28T16:06:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.899xw:0.897xh;0.0449xw,0.103xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lopez-billboard-1493388088.jpg?crop=0.504xw:1.00xh;0.249xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "We Are Living for Jennifer Lopez's Latest Outfit", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493323560.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
