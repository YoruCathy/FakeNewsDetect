Do you feel it in your toes?\n\nAs you may or may not have noticed, Christmas is all around us. \u2018Tis the season for novelty pop singles, for children\u2019s nativity plays, for office holiday parties, for happy reunions at airports, for Mariah Carey \u2014 in short, for Love Actually.\n\nRichard Curtis\u2019 \u201cultimate romantic comedy\u201d has been charming viewers every holiday season (and a lot of other seasons, too, if we\u2019re being honest) since it first hit theaters in 2003. In the layered collection of loosely-connected love stories taking place over the weeks leading up to one Christmas in London, everybody has their own favorite Love Actually moment \u2014 from a politician\u2019s personal dance party to a controversial cue-card confession to \u201cAre you from England?\u201d But which of the film\u2019s nine narrative threads reigns supreme?\n\nWe\u2019ve put them all in order from worst to best, just because it\u2019s Christmas (and at Christmas you tell the truth). Check out our ranking, actually, below!\n\n9. Juliet, Peter, and Mark\n\nIt\u2019s cool that Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all went on to be insanely famous and beloved. You know what\u2019s not cool? Every single thing about their storyline, especially those unforgivably creepy cue cards. The whole thing leaves a worse taste in my mouth than Juliet\u2019s \u201cterrible taste in pie.\u201d How can Juliet and Mark never tell Peter about their weird little moment? How did Mark even fall in love with Juliet if he never deigned to have a conversation with her\u2026 because he was already in love with her?! All the love that exists between this trio is built on secrets and lies. How do we all stand for it every Christmas? To me, this is not perfect.\n\n8. Harry and Karen (and Mia, I guess)\n\nHarry and Karen\u2019s love gone wrong has got to be the most crushing story in the movie because while there\u2019s still hope for Sarah\u2019s heart to mend, Karen knows that \u201clife will always be a little bit worse\u201d following the discovery of her husband\u2019s confirmed infidelity (and their subdued airport reunion at the end reinforces that realization). And if the image of Emma Thompson crying while listening to Joni Mitchell doesn\u2019t absolutely shatter your heart, I honestly have no idea what will.\n\n7. Sarah, Karl, and Michael\n\nThe attraction between Sarah and Karl is very underdeveloped, but I guess the gist is that Laura Linney\u2019s radiant goodness and Rodrigo Santoro\u2019s unreasonable handsomeness just inexorably drew them to each other until Karl finally asked Sarah to dance. Alas, while Sarah has probably the biggest heart of anyone in this whole movie filled with great big stupid hearts, there just isn\u2019t enough room in it for her to be both devoted to her brother Michael and to begin a relationship with beautiful, beautiful Karl. Don\u2019t worry, Sarah! Patrick Dempsey will be yours in 14 short years.\n\n6. Colin and the American girls\n\nWhen we first hear self-proclaimed \u201cGod of Sex\u201d Colin tell his friend Tony that he plans to cross the Atlantic to find a girlfriend \u2014 based on the infallible logic that no American girl will be able to resist his British accent \u2014 we accept it as a dumb clich\u00e9 and brace ourselves for Colin\u2019s inevitable humiliation at the hands of all the smart American girls who will reject him. But no! It\u2019s got to be Love Actually\u2019s cleverest joke (if one of its rather shallower love stories) that Colin was absolutely right. Good thing that suitcase was chock-a-block full of condoms!\n\n5. John and Judy\n\nThe simplest, and one of the sweetest, love stories in Love Actually is that of John and \u201cJust Judy,\u201d who feel no awkwardness whatsoever as they nakedly simulate sex in their work together as body doubles, but blush and giggle and stutter their way through their shy flirtations. When Judy finally admits, \u201call I want for Christmas\u2026 is you!\u201d it lacks the flash of some of the other romantic climaxes, but is no less filled with feeling.\n\n4. Jamie and Aur\u00e9lia\n\nYes, their (sort of) bilingual proposal scene is adorable, but it\u2019s also pretty schmaltzy, capitalizing on that cheapest of rom-com setups, the declaration of love before an audience of strangers. (Really, was it necessary for Jamie to attract a whole parade of Aur\u00e9lia\u2019s neighbors on his way to propose to her?) But it\u2019s hard to resist Colin Firth\u2019s broken Portuguese \u2014 or that soaring Love Actually score, played to greatest effect here.\n\n3. David and Natalie\n\nPrime Minister David and his household staffer Natalie first bond, in a quiet unspoken British way, over her tendency to curse and his taste for chocolate biscuits. His door-to-door search of her in \u201cthe dodgy end\u201d of Wandsworth is very charming, of course, but his greatest moment as a romantic hero is when he stands up to Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s sleazy American president (we get it, Love Actually, Americans have no class) at a press conference. Yes, he was talking about politics, but there\u2019s no way he would have spoken with such passion if he hadn\u2019t come to really hate POTUS for harassing Natalie.\n\n2. Billy Mack and Joe\n\nLove Actually knew that not all love stories had to be romantic a solid decade before Frozen hit us over the head with it! When rock & roll sellout Billy Mack figures out that his decades-old friendship with \u201cmy fat manager\u201d Joe means more to him than anything else, he delivers perhaps the movie\u2019s greatest confession of love: \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible mistake, Chubs, but you turned out to be the f\u2014ing love of my life.\u201d\n\n1. Daniel, Sam, and Joanna\n\nThe Christmas concert! The airport sprint! Love Actually\u2019s two greatest set pieces both belong to little Sam and his crush Joanna, and the movie\u2019s youngest heroes would probably earn the top spot on the merit of those scenes alone. But what makes their sweet love story really soar above the rest is how it\u2019s colored by the loss of Sam\u2019s mother at the beginning of the film, and how much Sam\u2019s pursuit of Joanna, assisted by his also-grieving stepfather Daniel, is about embracing and overcoming the \u201ctotal agony\u201d of love of all kinds. Finally, as additional confirmation that this storyline has been sprinkled with magic Christmas dust, Claudia Schiffer shows up at the end to date Daniel! Love actually is all around.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F13%2Fbetter-call-saul-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2Frhbh-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2F115093_46282_b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F09%2FHomeland_810_4979_R.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2F115093_48676b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2FNUP_189932_0195.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2FListen-to-Your-Heart.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2F116494_0767b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F12%2Flove-actualy-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fthe-voice-rec.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Frhony.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2064'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2Fdee-rogan-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F12%2Fsnl.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F03%2Fgreys-anatomy-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Fevan-rachel-wood-aaron-paul-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fthe-challenge-b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Foutlander-sea5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F12%2Flove-actualy-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2F116400_1225b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2FRVD417d_0162b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F12%2Flove-actualy-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Sollosi", "Seija Rankin", "Jodi Walker", "Maureen Lee Lenker", "Andy Hoglund", "Dalton Ross", "Chancellor Agard", "Samantha Highfill", "Sydney Bucksbaum", "James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/20/love-actually-story-ranking/", "title": "A definitive ranking of all the love stories in Love Actually", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "From worst to best, actually", "og": {"title": "A definitive ranking of all the love stories in \u2018Love Actually\u2019", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/20/love-actually-story-ranking/", "description": "Do you feel it in your fingers?
