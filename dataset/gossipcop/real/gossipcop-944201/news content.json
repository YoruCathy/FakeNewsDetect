She did not identify her surgeon, or reveal where the operation took place, but claimed that the day after the operation her left breast had swelled to twice the size of her right breast, and the nipple was turning purple.\n\n\u201cI went back to her [doctor] and she said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you come back Friday, I\u2019ve got surgery all day but if you get to the hospital early enough I\u2019ll take a look to see what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth Dubrow and Nassif surmised that Jessica was experiencing a hematoma, which they said requires immediate medical attention.\n\n\u201cThere are a few absolutes in medicine and surgery, and one of the most significant is when you get a pool of blood in a pocket of the body, you go right to the operating room and you remove it,\u201d Dubrow said in the clip.\n\nMOM WARNS ON VENOMOUS CATERPILLARS AFTER SON'S HARROWING MEDICAL SCARE\n\nJessica said that her nipple turned black and was crusting over, and that she could smell the infection. She claims her surgeon told her that the wound would absorb itself and gave her no further instructions. Jessica alleges that she then went to her family physician, who was horrified at the sight of her incisions and immediately identified the infection as MRSA.\n\nMRSA is a bacterial infection that's resistant to many different antibiotics and can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from skin infections to sepsis and pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nJessica said that the only solution was to remove both implants, and that she was stitched vertically, which left her with no breasts.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to a surgeon, you went to an assassin,\u201d Dubrow said.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/botched_patient.jpg?ve=1&tl=1",
