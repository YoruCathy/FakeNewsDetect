Eagle-eyed Swift fans, who all seem to have detailed reference timelines memorised for emergencies just like this one, appear to think that the ex in question is British actor Tom Hiddleston.\n\nSwift dated Hiddleston briefly but seriously (apparently) in 2016, and they broke up in September, which would put them together on the timeline at the right point for Hall to be referencing the relationship.\n\nWhile some speculated that the three-month romance was a publicity stunt (mostly because of that weird \u201cI <3 T.S.\u201d singlet Hiddles was spotted wearing), it seems like it was real enough to effect some changes in Swift \u2013 not positive ones.\n\nHall told hosts of the Morning Show:\n\nThere was a time last year\u2014I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to say anything\u2014she was dating someone. I\u2019d actually never met this person, but I could I could just tell every time I would talk to her, she would hunch over. I sent her this picture of her as Quasimodo that I edited. Because I was like, \u2018You cannot turn into Quasimodo for this guy. Every time you say his name, you hunch over.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a good friend who can call you on your relationship bullshit when they see it, especially because it can be so hard to see it yourself.\n\nAs for T-Swift\u2019s new beau, Joe Aldwyn, about whom many of the songs on Reputation are about? She\u2019s bloody loving him sick. Hall said \u201cshe\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen her\u201c.\n\nAww.
