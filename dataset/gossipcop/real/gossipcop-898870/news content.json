According to those reports, in fact, the Queen enjoyed the series though clucked her tongue, predictably at some of the \u201cheavily dramatized\u201d historical liberties. The Crown star Claire Foy didn\u2019t trust the rumors, telling Vanity Fair: \u201cI will believe it when I see it is all I\u2019ll say.\u201d Well perhaps after this year\u2019s Christmas speech in which the Queen appears to have included a cute little nod to Season 2, Foy will believe she has a royal fan.\n\nIn the fifth episode of the most recent season of The Crown, Foy\u2019s version of The Queen gives a disastrous and stiff speech to workers at a car factory. At the time and as depicted in the episode, royal critic Lord Altrincham suggested one solution to the Queen\u2019s communication difficulties was to televise her annual Christmas message\u2014which she has done ever since. In this year\u2019s speech, many suspect, the Queen paid direct homage to that Season 2 plot.\n\nThe Queen opened by saying: \u201cSixty years ago today, a young woman spoke about the speed of technological change as she presented the first television broadcast of its kind. She described the moment as a landmark. Six decades on, the presenter has \u2018evolved\u2019 somewhat, as has the technology she described.\u201d Don\u2019t let the third person fool you, the Queen is talking of herself here, and of a moment Foy embodied beautifully for Netflix.\n\nNow it\u2019s entirely possible that someone else\u2014savvy to the show\u2014slipped that reference in on the Queen\u2019s behalf. But whether authored by Elizabeth herself or someone close to her, the acknowledgment of The Crown was a hit with audiences.\n\nLord Altrincham himself couldn\u2019t have come up with a better way to humanize the Queen than to out her as a fellow binge watcher. Before Season 1 aired, Claire Foy admitted she was in denial that the Queen might ever watch her performance. \u201cShe\u2019s got other things to do with her time,\u201d Foy said and then, contemplating royal disapproval, added: \u201cWe\u2019ll get put in The Tower for treason.\u201d\n\nBut Foy has since adopted a less fearful attitude, telling Vanity Fair: \u201cI would be very interested to see what she thinks about historical elements of it. . .the personal level of it, and seeing someone else act out your life, and act out your most painful moments of grief, or happiness, or fear, or triumph, or whatever, I don\u2019t think would be a very enjoyable thing, which is why I doubt very much that she\u2019s watched it.\u201d\n\nBut whether or not the Queen is a fan of Foy or her performance, Foy is an unabashed fan of the Queen. Thanking her directly during a SAG acceptance speech earlier this year, Foy said: \u201cShe\u2019s been at the center of the world. I think the world could do with a few more women at the center of it.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2c40d0cbb3bf329792340b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Adolf-Hitler-Duke-and-Duchess-of-Windsor.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a14c7dc821fe67c49623a77/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-70th-SS01.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a14c7dc99135b2b9a688407/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-70th-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1c4461724b4c6e320e9432/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-Vanessa-Kirby-1217-Vanities.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2f53ca577ffb294a25322e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/the-crown-season-3.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a14c7dcaba4653ae2347b46/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-70th-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-12-26%2520at%252012.20.59%2520PM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-12-26%252520at%25252012.20.59%252520PM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26ff63cbb3bf3297923353/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Princess-Margaret-Lord-Snowdown-Relationship-SS16.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-12-26%2520at%252012.20.59%2520PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso", "Julie Mille", "Katey Ric", "Krista Smit"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/does-queen-elizabeth-watch-the-crown-christmas-speech-season-2", "title": "Did the Real Queen Elizabeth Just Prove She Watches The Crown?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.", "id": "5a42ac2df504972c1f3e6a8e", "keywords": "royals,real queen elizabeth,claire foy,the crown,season,christmas speech", "news_keywords": "royals,real queen elizabeth,claire foy,the crown,season,christmas speech", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a42ac2df504972c1f3e6a8e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-12-26%2520at%252012.20.59%2520PM.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Did the Real Queen Elizabeth Just Prove She Watches The Crown?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/does-queen-elizabeth-watch-the-crown-christmas-speech-season-2"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-12-26%2520at%252012.20.59%2520PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Did the Real Queen Elizabeth Just Prove She Watches The Crown?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVWGYmrXjH0?ecver=2"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
