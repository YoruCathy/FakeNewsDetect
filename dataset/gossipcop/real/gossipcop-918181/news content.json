But when Tiffany Haddish said she wanted to get her money's worth out of the Alexander McQueen dress she bought for the premiere of Girl's Trip back when she hosted the show in November 2017, she really wasn\u2019t kidding. Not only did she wear it to deliver her SNL monologue, but she brought it out again to present at the 2018 Oscars.\n\nAs Haddish explained on SNL (where she made history as the first black female comedian to ever host the show, by the way), the $4,000 gown, which she wore to the Girl's Trip red carpet in July 2017, cost more than her mortgage\u2014it\u2019s only right that she re-wear it for special occasions.\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- Episode 1730 -- Pictured: Host Tiffany Haddish during the Opening Monologue in Studio 8H on Saturday, November 11, 2017 -- (Photo by: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) NBC\n\nSo, she donned the Alexander McQueen number to appear on SNL. But if you thought that would be the last time you saw the dress, you'd be wrong: Haddish chose to wear the halter-top dress once again to hand out the Oscar for Best Animated/Live Action Short with Maya Rudolph at the 2018 Academy Awards.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 13: Actress Tiffany Haddish attends the premiere of \"Girls Trip\" at Regal LA Live Stadium 14 on July 13, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.

As Haddish said on SNL: \u201cI feel like I should be able to wear what I want, when I want, however many times I want, as long as I Febreze it.\u201d Preach.\n\nHOLLYWOOD, CA - MARCH 04: Actors Tiffany Haddish (L) and Maya Rudolph speak onstage during the 90th Annual Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center on March 4, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

A good night indeed.\n\nRelated: Tiffany Haddish Explains How to Take a Selfie With Beyonc\u00e9", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc79577c6a92acd888717/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-817020296.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccd3d19724717d28d5996/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927300596.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc8a6c0cda831d24f4442/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-873080598.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc57099ea9a2ba3431b82/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927298310.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Minton", "Melissa Minto"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/tiffany-haddish-alexander-mcqueen-dress-2018-oscars", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Wore Her Favorite Alexander McQueen Dress to Present at the 2018 Oscars", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Melissa Minton", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "While presenting at the 2018 Oscars with Maya Rudolph, Tiffany Haddish wore the same white Alexander McQueen dress she wore on Saturday Night Live.", "id": "5a9cc57105fbc32abc7901b3", "keywords": "snd,tiffany haddish,oscars,oscars 2018", "news_keywords": "snd,tiffany haddish,oscars,oscars 2018", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a9cc57105fbc32abc7901b3", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"While presenting at the 2018 Oscars with Maya Rudolph, Tiffany Haddish wore the same white Alexander McQueen dress she wore on Saturday Night Live.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc6321722d622f2de1b05/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-817020296.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc6321722d622f2de1b05/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-817020296.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She brought the gown out (again) to present at the 2018 Oscars.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Is Keeping Her Promise to Rewear That $4,000 Alexander McQueen Dress", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/tiffany-haddish-alexander-mcqueen-dress-2018-oscars"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "She brought the gown out (again) to present at the 2018 Oscars.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Is Keeping Her Promise to Rewear That $4,000 Alexander McQueen Dress"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
