I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me ... We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.\u201d\n\nAsked how he felt about Kevin Spacey and Dustin Hoffman, actors who have been accused of multiple counts of sexual misconduct, Neeson said he was \u201con the fence\u201d about allegations against Hoffman, saying that what he had been accused of was \u201cchildhood stuff\u201d.\n\nDiscussing the allegations against Hoffman, Neeson said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re doing a play and you\u2019re with your family \u2013 other actors, technicians \u2013 you do silly things ... and it becomes kind of superstitious, if you don\u2019t do it every night you think it\u2019s going to jinx the show\u201d.\n\nDustin Hoffman has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women, of exposing himself to a minor and of sexual harassment.\n\nNeeson was quick to distance himself from Hoffman\u2019s alleged behaviour, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve done similar things to what he\u2019s done.\u201d", "images":
