Nearly everyone had a strong take on the show Lena Dunham created. Below is Part 2 of Variety\u2019s TV critics\u2019 reflections on the show\u2019s legacy and impact \u2014 and why they\u2019re both happy and sad that the story of Hannah Horvath and her friends is wrapping up. (Part 1, from before the finale aired, is here, and a post-finale talk with executive producers Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham is here.)\n\nSonia Saraiya: Well, that was pretty perfect. I mean, it wasn\u2019t, but in its insular, domestic sphere, harsh reality, \u201cLatching\u201d is where this whole season was trending, and such a fitting counterpoint to a similarly insular but much more self-aggrandizing premiere episode of \u201cGirls.\u201d I appreciate that instead of being about transformation, for any of the characters, the finale emphasizes resilience \u2014 that problems arise, and our predictable anxieties will flare up, but you can get better at bouncing back.\n\nFurthermore \u2014 I have never felt fully onboard with Hannah\u2019s pregnancy as a plot point, and I appreciated learning that she wasn\u2019t fully onboard with it, either. That narrative about being a new mother sounds like it may have come from Jenni Konner, who co-wrote and directed this episode, who talks about childrearing in interviews (including in a post-finale Q&A with Variety). Glimpsing a bit of \u201cGirls\u201d famously raw and unflinching lens directed at child-rearing is pretty satisfying.\n\nBut really, what got me is that Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d was stitched \u2014 thematically and melodically \u2014 through the episode. It\u2019s almost not fair, because that song is wrenching enough to do a lot of emotional heavy lifting on its own. But its circularity about running away, growing up, finding home, and being someone must feel especially relevant when you\u2019re a single mom in a house in the woods, just one car trip away from running away. In the premiere of \u201cGirls,\u201d Hannah asks her own parents for money; in the finale, she has to assume the mantle of grown-up, even though she\u2019s scared s\u2013itless, mostly because someone has to do it, and she can\u2019t quit now. But is this what she wanted? Is she happy? Or is her settled contentment at the end, once Grover has finally started breastfeeding, about as good as it gets in this life? \u201cFast Car\u201d doesn\u2019t have easy answers, and I liked that \u201cLatching\u201d doesn\u2019t either.\n\nMaureen Ryan: Oh \u201cGirls,\u201d you did the most \u201cGirls\u201d thing possible: After loving most of the lyrical and emotionally acute final season, I spent a good chunk of the finale wanting to scream and fending off a migraine. For me, the combative self-absorption of the characters just felt overly familiar and the setting a little too claustrophobic, and for the first two-thirds of the episode, a lot of the post-birth story played out in ways that I found frustrating rather than illuminating. I see where you\u2019re coming from, and the last few minutes were sweet and memorable, but in the main, I found this particular variety of \u201cGirls\u201d episode \u2014 argumentative and somewhat predictable \u2014 more off-putting than most. So here we are, having one more critical argument about \u201cGirls\u201d \u2014 yay?\n\nThe thing is, many different TV shows have hauled out the difficulties of parenting a newborn to manufacture drama or conflict, so the topics on display and the treatments of them just felt overly familiar to me. And perhaps Marnie\u2019s oblivious self-absorption was meant to be funny, but we\u2019ve seen that so many times before, and given the stakes \u2014 i.e., the life and health of a baby \u2014 her condescending selfishness really grated on me throughout much of the final half-hour. This being \u201cGirls,\u201d perhaps her behavior was meant to annoy, but that\u2019s a flavor that can get old fast.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the great Becky Ann Baker showed up to school everybody that I could actually begin to find a few shreds of enjoyment in the finale. The upside is, all the yelling and crying and immaturity made me more than OK than with the fact that this show \u2014 which I have often loved, especially this season \u2014 is ending. Good luck, little Grover. (She really named her kid Grover? Hannah. You did not have to do that. Sigh.)\n\nSaraiya: How funny that you are positive about the show, but not about the finale, while I am almost vice-versa. I liked \u201cLatching,\u201d though I admit that I have no idea what to make of the fact that Hannah\u2019s son is a brown baby \u2014 and will grow up to be a man of color. With this show\u2019s relationship to racial dynamics, something about this feels strangely superficial. Of course, at this point, \u201cGirls\u201d is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn\u2019t \u2014 but isn\u2019t it a bit odd that It\u2019s never discussed or dealt with, it\u2019s just, oh yeah, Hannah\u2019s having a brown baby? The show\u2019s deep-seated discomfort with engaging with race never disappeared, despite six seasons of us talking about it.\n\nIn Part 1, you wrote that you always found \u201cGirls\u201d to be sincere. That struck me while watching the finale and pondering this baby, because I was so often frustrated that the show wasn\u2019t sincere with its setups \u2014 there was this surreality or fantasy-level to the characters\u2019 lives that made them more ciphers than characters. Even in this final season, which has been one of the most grounded, I read this long piece about how Hannah\u2019s salaried-with-benefits teaching job at a cushy lib arts school upstate is essentially impossible. Maybe what you were saying is that the show always meant well \u2014 but even that, I\u2019m not always so sure about. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m ascribing evil motives to the show either. But like, I think sometimes the show was going for the best joke, or the most interesting denouement, not the one it felt the most strongly about.\n\nIn its defense, though, I think \u201cGirls\u201d was as much about Dunham and co. making characters out of the idiosyncrasies and silliness that they themselves were experiencing in the high creative echelons of contemporary hipsterdom. Hannah the writer, Ray the failed artist, Adam the actor, Marnie the \u201cmusician,\u201d Shosh the publicist, Jessa from rehab \u2014 and on, and on. That person you know who moved upstate to have a kid on her own. That girl who got engaged two weeks after meeting someone and seems very happy. The one whose marriage fell apart and is now having some obscure experience of personal growth in another state. We don\u2019t have tell-all novels, a la Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis, about the New York arty media scene anymore: now we have shows like \u201cGirls\u201d to deliver second- or thirdhand gossip.\n\nThis cements one of my long-held feelings about the show, which is that more than being aimed at millennials, it was a show about millennials for millennials\u2019 parents. Not you, Mo, you proud Gen X-er, but those homeowning HBO subscribers who want to ask what their kids are doing but maybe don\u2019t feel so comfortable asking about \u201ccrack-cidents\u201d on the phone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insignificant that this series has been as much about Becky Ann Baker\u2019s transformation, as Hannah\u2019s mom, as it has been about Hannah herself. (She was just fantastic in the finale.)\n\nRyan: I think you\u2019re onto something there. I once wrote a long piece about the similarities between Liz Phair and Lena Dunham (who both went to Oberlin, and who both were lionized and torn apart in equal measure for their creative exploits \u2014 20 years apart). We touched on this briefly in Part 1 of our dialogue, this idea of voyeurism: I would bet most HBO subscribers have never lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but they want a window into that world, just like they want to know, on Sunday nights, what\u2019s up in the realm of dragons and Lannisters. You\u2019re so right about this being the Jay McInerney or Tama Janowitz novel of its time. Who has the time to read the hot new novelist\u2019s take on what the cool people are doing in NYC? But we can watch this show and feel at least partially informed about what the Youngs are up to.\n\nI recall that somewhat early in the show\u2019s run, a bunch of stories were published on the topic of how a goodly number of middle-aged male HBO subscribers watched \u201cGirls.\u201d Well, why wouldn\u2019t they? Not only would it make all those tuition-paying dads feel like they knew what was up in their kids\u2019 lives, \u201cGirls\u201d contended with the issues surrounding masculinity and intimacy that a lot of other prestige shows explore, but with a lot fewer murders and brothels.\n\nHannah grappled with a lot of things \u2014 her narcissism, her difficulty in sustaining jobs and relationships, her parents\u2019 breakup, and now, this season, an unexpected pregnancy. But I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about that the fact that a huge throughline of the show has concerned the reality that the men in Hannah\u2019s life were often both more and less than she could handle, and she was never quite sure what to do about that. (As Hannah herself notes, Grover was just the latest in a long list of males with whom she had difficulties, though he was probably also the cutest. And not to sidestep the race thing, but it\u2019s really strange to me that Hannah wouldn\u2019t address the fact that she is parenting a non-white boy. You\u2019d think that would be the exact sort of thing she\u2019d monologue about, and I can definitely see why you felt that aspect of the story felt tacked-on.)\n\nBut speaking of men in general, I think a lot of women watching could relate to the issues that Hannah and all the other women contended with when it came to the guys in their lives. Weirdly enough, there were a lot of moments in which the men felt as though they were more dimensionalized than the women \u2014 in a show called \u201cGirls.\u201d It was one more conundrum to contend with, I suppose.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t feel all that cheated about who grew most or least, given that, as you say, for most of the characters on the show, they didn\u2019t grow a ton. As was the case with Don Draper, I think they got better at recognizing and accepting their flaws, and seeing past their own pain and self-absorption and at least attempting altruism on a regular basis (the presence of a helpless baby in your life will often force that kind of accelerated growth on a person). Over time, though they were still spectacularly myopic at times, the show undeniably got better at depicting them sometimes stepping past the landmines that they, in the past, would have embraced in a fairly unthinking way.\n\nSaraiya: This is interesting, because I wouldn\u2019t have come to this conclusion. I never felt the show was interrogating its men. Adam is a great character, and has really grown on me, but I don\u2019t think the show has ever really investigated what was behind his pent-up rage and desire to humiliate his sexual partners in the first season \u2014 the negging, almost, that characterized his affection for Hannah. I mean, he ended up with Jessa, who two episodes ago admitted she was a sociopath. Ray is a curmudgeon, and the show kind of embraces that; but along the way he\u2019s used Shoshana pretty abominably. Laird is out here still hitting on Hannah. And while Elijah is, again, played very well by Andrew Rannells, I\u2019m not so sure that he\u2019s learned or grown or anything. If \u201cGirls\u201d is anything, it\u2019s the show of barely perceptible character development.\n\nOn the other hand, though, it\u2019s probably significant that Hannah has not a girl baby but a boy \u2014 Grover, the name for the cutest boy muppet. And throughout the finale, Hannah makes these funny comments like \u201cMen are disgusting!\u201d for no real reason. Maybe for Dunham, \u201cGirls\u201d was partly an effort to redeem men. It seems she may have succeeded.\n\nRyan: You may be right \u2014 along with the show, I may not have investigated the motivations and actions of the male characters as much as I could have. I think that might be partly for a defensible reason \u2014 damn, this cast was so good. It was hard not to be forgiving (possibly too forgiving) when the characters were this unpredictable and often hilarious in their oddity and messy, fascinating humanity. Alex Karpovsky, Adam Driver, Andrew Rannells and Peter Scolari were just so fun to watch, no matter how weak or selfish or weird their characters were, and Chris O\u2019Dowd saying \u201cThat was my Humie\u201d in his epic final fight with Jessa ranks in my Top 5 \u201cGirls\u201d lines ever. Elijah was often the comic relief, but Rannells could turn on a dime and almost make me cry, even when he was just running lines in a department store.\n\nWould you agree that the members of the cast \u2014 particularly the core four women \u2014 have become better actors, in some cases shockingly so, since the show began? It\u2019s not that I think anyone was bad back in 2012, but there were moments when I wondered about the range and versatility of some of the performers. The assurance that they have now, and the wide array of emotions that they can lock into, I find, is truly remarkable. Dunham in particular has been able to work in small gestures and very subtle emotional shades this season. She\u2019s really been exceptional. And it didn\u2019t surprise me that Allison Williams was so good in \u201cGet Out\u201d because she\u2019s grown tremendously on \u201cGirls\u201d in the last few years. Am I wrong about that?\n\nSaraiya: Oh, absolutely. Dunham in particular has become a much stronger actress. Her scene with Jemima Kirke in the penultimate episode, \u201cGoodbye Tour,\u201d is striking for just how emotive both are after spending so many seasons playing robotic caricatures. I\u2019m inclined to think that Williams\u2019 performance has stayed the same, but the writers\u2019 sense of irony towards her has heightened (and in \u201cGet Out,\u201d she is entirely manufactured, which of course makes perfect sense). The show has also been characterized by performers that were already great, right from the start: Becky Ann Baker, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet, and Alex Karpovsky (who in some episodes stole the show from Dunham).\n\nRyan: Agreed. To wrap things up, here\u2019s the greatest compliment I can pay any show, and I think \u201cGirls\u201d certainly merits it: I know I\u2019ll spend time thinking about what all these men and women are up to, even though I won\u2019t get to check in on their lives and loves and aspirations any time soon. How will they get on? Will they find ways to support each other, even as they stumble over the bigger obstacles and frustrations life is likely to throw at them in the next couple of decades? If there is a reunion movie several years from now, I\u2019d eagerly watch that (and of course it\u2019s no sure thing that this great cast, all of whom deserve to go on to bigger and better things, will not too busy to be reassembled). What\u2019s great is that I honestly can\u2019t fully picture the trajectory of each character, though I like to imagine a future in which Ray is the mayor of New York, or at least the crankiest dad in Brooklyn.\n\nThese characters frustrated me, they entertained me, they shook up what was possible on television. They made me re-examine my assumptions and they prompted some of the best conversations I\u2019ve ever had about this medium that we love. Hannah Horvath, you forced me to think harder and to dig deeper, and I don\u2019t know if I fully got what \u201cGirls\u201d was going for all the time, but I\u2019m truly grateful for the provocations and the laughs and the unpredictable ride.\n\nI can easily picture Grover reminiscing about his mom 20 years from now, when he\u2019s sitting on the lawn of some well-regarded liberal arts college.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a lot,\u201d he\u2019ll probably say, \u201cbut it was an adventure every day.\u201d", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/hbo-girls-ep-610-hannah-marnie-8789-schafer-mark-2.jpg?w=1024", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fcolumns%2Fhbo-girls-show-ending-lena-dunham-legacy-2-1202030312%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202030312&comment_count=4", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/hbo-girls-ep-610-hannah-marnie-8789-schafer-mark-2.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sonia Saraiya Maureen Ryan", "Sonia Saraiya", "Maureen Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/columns/hbo-girls-show-ending-lena-dunham-legacy-2-1202030312/", "title": "Variety TV Critics Discuss the Legacy and Impact of \u2018Girls\u2019 (Part 2)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Maureen Ryan and Sonia Saraiya discuss the legacy of Lena Dunham's \"Girls\" (Part 2 of 2).", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202030312, "author": "Sonia Saraiya,Maureen Ryan", "pmc-category": "Columns", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-04-16T20:30:38"}, "pmc-tag": "Girls,HBO,Lena Dunham", "title": "Variety TV Critics Discuss the Legacy and Impact of \u2018Girls\u2019 (Part 2)", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "Columns", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Variety TV Critics Discuss the Legacy and Impact of \u2018Girls\u2019 (Part 2)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/columns/hbo-girls-show-ending-lena-dunham-legacy-2-1202030312/", "description": "When \u201cGirls\u201d premiered in April 2012, it was almost all that the TV aficionado community could talk about, and it made a giant splash in pop culture, too.

Maybe what you were saying is that the show always meant well \u2014 but even that, I\u2019m not always so sure about. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m ascribing evil motives to the show either. But like, I think sometimes the show was going for the best joke, or the most interesting denouement, not the one it felt the most strongly about.\r\n\r\nIn its defense, though, I think \u201cGirls\u201d was as much about Dunham and co. making characters out of the idiosyncrasies and silliness that they themselves were experiencing in the high creative echelons of contemporary hipsterdom. Hannah the writer, Ray the failed artist, Adam the actor, Marnie the \u201cmusician,\u201d Shosh the publicist, Jessa from rehab \u2014 and on, and on. That person you know who moved upstate to have a kid on her own. That girl who got engaged two weeks after meeting someone and seems very happy. The one whose marriage fell apart and is now having some obscure experience of personal growth in another state. We don\u2019t have tell-all novels, a la Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis, about the New York arty media scene anymore: now we have shows like \u201cGirls\u201d to deliver second- or thirdhand gossip.\r\n\r\nThis cements one of my long-held feelings about the show, which is that more than being aimed at millennials, it was a show about millennials for millennials\u2019 parents. Not you, Mo, you proud Gen X-er, but those homeowning HBO subscribers who want to ask what their kids are doing but maybe don\u2019t feel so comfortable asking about \u201ccrack-cidents\u201d on the phone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insignificant that this series has been as much about Becky Ann Baker\u2019s transformation, as Hannah\u2019s mom, as it has been about Hannah herself. (She was just fantastic in the finale.)\r\n\r\nRyan: I think you\u2019re onto something there. I once wrote a long piece about the similarities between Liz Phair and Lena Dunham (who both went to Oberlin, and who both were lionized and torn apart in equal measure for their creative exploits -- 20 years apart). We touched on this briefly in Part 1 of our dialogue, this idea of voyeurism: I would bet most HBO subscribers have never lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but they want a window into that world, just like they want to know, on Sunday nights, what\u2019s up in the realm of dragons and Lannisters. You\u2019re so right about this being the Jay McInerney or Tama Janowitz novel of its time. Who has the time to read the hot new novelist\u2019s take on what the cool people are doing in NYC? But we can watch this show and feel at least partially informed about what the Youngs are up to. \r\n\r\nI recall that somewhat early in the show\u2019s run, a bunch of stories were published on the topic of how a goodly number of middle-aged male HBO subscribers watched \u201cGirls.\u201d Well, why wouldn\u2019t they? Not only would it make all those tuition-paying dads feel like they knew what was up in their kids\u2019 lives, \u201cGirls\u201d contended with the issues surrounding masculinity and intimacy that a lot of other prestige shows explore, but with a lot fewer murders and brothels.\r\n\r\nHannah grappled with a lot of things -- her narcissism, her difficulty in sustaining jobs and relationships, her parents\u2019 breakup, and now, this season, an unexpected pregnancy. But I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about that the fact that a huge throughline of the show has concerned the reality that the men in Hannah\u2019s life were often both more and less than she could handle, and she was never quite sure what to do about that. (As Hannah\u00a0herself notes, Grover was just the latest in a long list of males with whom she had difficulties, though he was probably also the cutest. And not to sidestep the race thing, but it\u2019s really strange to me that Hannah wouldn\u2019t address the fact that she is parenting a non-white boy. You\u2019d think that would be the exact sort of thing she\u2019d monologue about, and I can definitely see why you felt that aspect of the story felt tacked-on.)\r\n\r\nBut speaking of men in general, I think a lot of women watching could relate to the issues that Hannah and all the other women contended with when it came to the guys in their lives. Weirdly enough, there were a lot of moments in which the men felt as though they were more dimensionalized than the women \u2014 in a show called \u201cGirls.\u201d It was one more conundrum to contend with, I suppose. \r\n\r\nThat said, I don\u2019t feel all that cheated about who grew most or least, given that, as you say, for most of the characters on the show, they didn\u2019t grow a ton. As was the case with Don Draper, I think they got better at recognizing and accepting their flaws, and seeing past their own pain and self-absorption and at least attempting altruism on a regular basis (the presence of a helpless baby in your life will often force that kind of accelerated growth on a person). Over time, though they were still spectacularly myopic at times, the show undeniably got better at depicting them sometimes stepping past the landmines that they, in the past, would have embraced in a fairly unthinking way.\r\n\r\nSaraiya: This is interesting, because I wouldn\u2019t have come to this conclusion. I never felt the show was interrogating its men. Adam is a great character, and has really grown on me, but I don\u2019t think the show has ever really investigated what was behind his pent-up rage and desire to humiliate his sexual partners in the first season \u2014 the negging, almost, that characterized his affection for Hannah. I mean, he ended up with Jessa, who two episodes ago admitted she was a sociopath. Ray is a curmudgeon, and the show kind of embraces that; but along the way he\u2019s used Shoshana pretty abominably. Laird is out here still hitting on Hannah. And while Elijah is, again, played very well by Andrew Rannells, I\u2019m not so sure that he\u2019s learned or grown or anything. If \u201cGirls\u201d is anything, it\u2019s the show of barely perceptible character development.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, though, it\u2019s probably significant that Hannah has not a girl baby but a boy \u2014 Grover, the name for the cutest boy muppet. And throughout the finale, Hannah makes these funny comments like \u201cMen are disgusting!\u201d for no real reason. Maybe for Dunham, \u201cGirls\u201d was partly an effort to redeem men. It seems she may have succeeded.\r\n\r\nRyan: You may be right -- along with the show, I may not have investigated the motivations and actions of the male characters as much as I could have. I think that might be partly for a defensible reason -- damn, this cast was so good. It was hard not to be forgiving (possibly too forgiving) when the characters were this unpredictable and often hilarious in their oddity and messy, fascinating humanity. Alex Karpovsky, Adam Driver, Andrew Rannells and Peter Scolari were just so fun to watch, no matter how weak or selfish or weird their characters were, and Chris O\u2019Dowd saying \u201cThat was my Humie\u201d in his epic final fight with Jessa ranks in my Top 5 \u201cGirls\u201d lines ever. Elijah was often the comic relief, but Rannells could turn on a dime and almost make me cry, even when he was just running lines in a department store. \r\n\r\nWould you agree that the members of the cast -- particularly the core four women -- have become better actors, in some cases shockingly so, since the show began? It\u2019s not that I think anyone was bad back in 2012, but there were moments when I wondered about the range and versatility of some of the performers. The assurance that they have now, and the wide array of emotions that they can lock into, I find, is truly remarkable. Dunham in particular has been able to work in small gestures and very subtle emotional shades this season. She\u2019s really been exceptional. And it didn\u2019t surprise me that Allison Williams was so good in \u201cGet Out\u201d because she\u2019s grown tremendously on \u201cGirls\u201d in the last few years. Am I wrong about that?\r\n\r\nSaraiya: Oh, absolutely. Dunham in particular has become a much stronger actress. Her scene with Jemima Kirke\u00a0in the penultimate episode, \u201cGoodbye Tour,\u201d is striking for just how emotive both are after spending so many seasons playing robotic caricatures. I\u2019m inclined to think that Williams\u2019 performance has stayed the same, but the writers\u2019 sense of irony towards her has heightened (and in \u201cGet Out,\u201d she is entirely manufactured, which of course makes perfect sense). The show has also been characterized by performers that were already great, right from the start: Becky Ann Baker, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, Zosia Mamet, and Alex Karpovsky (who in some episodes stole the show from Dunham).\r\n\r\nRyan: Agreed.\u00a0To wrap things up, here's the greatest compliment I can pay any show, and I think \"Girls\" certainly merits it: I know I'll spend time thinking about what all these men and women are up to, even though I won't get to check in on their lives and loves and aspirations any time soon. How will they get on? Will they find ways to support each other, even as they stumble over the bigger obstacles and frustrations life is likely to throw at them in the next couple of decades? If there is a\u00a0reunion movie several years from now, I'd eagerly watch that (and of course it's no sure thing that this great cast, all of whom deserve to go on to bigger and better things, will\u00a0not too busy to be reassembled). What's great is that I honestly can't fully picture the trajectory of each character, though I like to imagine a future in which Ray is the mayor of New York, or at least the crankiest dad in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nThese characters frustrated me, they entertained me, they shook up what was possible on television. They made me re-examine my assumptions\u00a0and they prompted some of the best conversations I've ever had about this medium that we love. Hannah Horvath, you forced me to think harder and to dig deeper, and I don't know if I fully got what \"Girls\" was going for all the time, but I'm truly grateful for the provocations and the laughs and the unpredictable ride.\r\n\r\nI can easily picture Grover reminiscing about his mom 20 years from now, when he's sitting on the lawn of some well-regarded liberal arts college.\r\n\r\n\"She's a lot,\" he'll probably say, \"but it\u00a0was an adventure every day.\"", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492399838.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
