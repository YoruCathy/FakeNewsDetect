However, it\u2019s the shade from the KUWTK star that has fans buzzing. Kim took the time to share what she hates most about each of her siblings \u2014 and she did not hold back.\n\nIn her defense, she does start off by listing the traits she loves about her family, including Rob Kardashian\u2018s sense of humor, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2018s \u201cI-don\u2019tgive-a-f\u2013k attitude,\u201d and Kendall Jenner\u2018s sweetness. Then things quickly go left.\n\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 Kourtney [Kardashian]\u2019s stubbornness. And Khlo\u00e9\u2019s getting too sensitive,\u201d she told the magazine of her siblings\u2019 flaws. \u201cI would take away Kendall\u2019s anxiety, Kylie\u2019s \u2018I don\u2019t care, I know what I\u2019m doing\u2019 thing and probably my brother\u2019s moodiness.\u201d The only family member exempt from Kim\u2019s critique was momager Kris Jenner, who the reality star deemed \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nPettiness aside, this is the seventh time Kim has graced a Vogue cover and she revealed she hoped to return to the Asian country with cameras. \u201cThe saris, the jewelry, the clothes \u2014 everything was so beautiful,\u201d she added. \u201cI told my show that we have to figure out how to get to India.\u201d This does not mean everyone was happy to see Kim on the cover. She did receive some backlash after fans called out the magazine for not featuring an Indian beauty.\n\nLast year, her sister Kendall faced similar criticism and Vogue India defended it\u2019s decision to feature the model. \u201cIn the last 10 years, Vogue India has had only 12 international covers, including Kendall Jenner in 2017,\u201d the magazine said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, statistically, 90% of our covers are Indian! And we are proud of that. India has given the world so many beautiful faces to admire. After all, we are Vogue, an international brand, and we want to give the love back by featuring some of the best international celebrities on our covers. Occasionally!\u201d\n\nIn more important news, Kim also just shared the first photo of Chicago West on her Instagram page \u2014 and fans were freaking out. \u201cWow! She is your twin,\u201d one fan wrote before another added, \u201cTwo beauties\u2026 baby Chicago is her mommy\u2019s twin.\u201d Kim just keeps winning.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scott-Kourtney-Coparents.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-vogue-india.png?resize=505%2C290", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lauren-burnham-kylie-jenner.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Khloe-Kardashians-Daughter-True-Thompson-Really-Lights-Up-When-Aunt-Kylie-Jenner-Comes-Over.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scott-Disick-and-Sofia-Richie.jpg?crop=0px%2C62px%2C2280px%2C1294px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/True-Thompson-Dream-Kardashian-Cute-Photos-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C125px%2C1080px%2C613px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Skincare-Routine-Should-You-Try-It-Out-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kardashian-family-teaser-3.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-vogue-india.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Selfie.jpg?crop=199px%2C0px%2C810px%2C810px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Thompson-Already-Loves-Picking-Out-Her-Own-Clothes.jpg?crop=71px%2C393px%2C939px%2C531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kylie-stormi-snapchat.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10491194ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C179px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-fat-jewish-emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-marriage-exclusive-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Admits-She-Will-\u2018Never-Come-in-Between\u2019-Tristan-and-Daughter-True-After-Scandal-pp.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-vogue-india.png?resize=505%2C290", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Quintana"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kim-kardashian-vogue-india-154796/", "title": "Kim Kardashian in Vogue India \u2014 Spills What She Hates About Sisters!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Keep the tea coming!
