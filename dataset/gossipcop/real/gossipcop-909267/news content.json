For those who are out of the loop, there is a reason why Captain Marvel is in this costume.\n\nWhile it looks weird for some, it is actually not a deviation from the comics. Savvy comic book readers will recognize that the color scheme matches the old costume by the original Captain Marvel, aka Mar-Vell, before he switched it out for a red and blue one. According to reports, Carol Danvers herself donned a similar suit before she upgraded it to the most recognizable gear.", "images": ["https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/72529/brie-larson.png?w=760&h=431", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/79005/coronavirus.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78997/coronavirus.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/77657/marriage.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/72529/brie-larson.png", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/79003/rev-earl-w-buddy-duggins.png?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://christiantoday-29b4.kxcdn.com/assets/img/logo-footer.png", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/69052/breathless-man-in-the-morning-sky-sunrise.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/78768/greg-laurie.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=47&r=24", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.christiantoday_com,DomainId.120718", "https://go.ezoic.net/utilcave_com/img/ezoic.png", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/78849/alone.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=56", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/78980/rebekah-and-debbie.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=78&t=48", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/69052/breathless-man-in-the-morning-sky-sunrise.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-29b4.kxcdn.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/78108/mao-zedong.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=56&r=37", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/79008/premature-twins.png?w=82&h=59&l=67&r=49", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/79010/john-houghton.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=54&r=34", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/77217/sky.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/54605/tim-keller.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/79008/premature-twins.png?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20015427&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/79013/coronavirus.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=45&r=60"], "top_img": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/72529/brie-larson.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://christiantoday.com/article/captain-marvel-spoilers-brie-larsons-costume-debuts-online-but-isnt-what-fans-expected/124752.htm", "title": "'Captain Marvel' spoilers: Brie Larson's costume debuts online but isn't what fans expected", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "captain marvel,Captain Marvel set photos,Captain Marvel spoilers,Captain Marvel news,Captain Marvel cast,Captain Marvel Brie Larson", "description": "Larson was photographed in her superhero costume recently, but it is not her iconic red, blue, and gold suit.
