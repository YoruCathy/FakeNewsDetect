{"url": "https://www.advocate.com/television/2018/9/06/33-must-see-tv-shows-lgbtq-viewers-fall-2018", "text": "Super-producer Greg Berlanti and the CW continue to provide some of the most forward-thinking queer representation in television with the ever-growing list of LGBTQ characters on the superhero-themed shows. Season 2 of Supergirl saw Supergirl Kara Danvers\u2019s sister Alex (Chyler Leigh) come out and fall in love with a woman. This season, the series introduces TV's first transgender superhero with Nia Nal, or Dreamer (played by trans actress Nicole Maines).\n\nLast season, the CW\u2019s outstanding Black Lightning introduced a lesbian superhero of color in Anissa Pierce (Nafessa Williams), whose superhero name is Thunder. But even before Supergirl and Black Lightning, Berlanti\u2019s shows with masked and/or caped characters already featured plenty of LGBTQ characters including Legends of Tomorrow\u2019s Sarah Lance (Caity Lotz), who began her stint on Arrow, which now features a married gay superhero with Mister Terrific (Echo Kellum). The Flash\u2019s queer characters include Wentworth Miller\u2019s Citizen Cold, who appeared on Legends for a time but will return to Star City for a few episodes this season, where he won\u2019t be the only out character, considering Police Captain David Singh (Patrick Sabongui) is gay and married.\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, it was announced at Comic-Con that The Flash is getting another queer character this season, but just who that will be is top secret so far.\n\nThe Flash premieres October 9 at 8 p.m., Supergirl premieres October 14 at 8 p.m., Arrow premieres October 15 at 9 p.m,, and Legends of Tomorrow premieres October 22 at 8 p.m. on the CW. All times are Eastern/Pacific.", "images": ["https://www.advocate.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/facebook-share-button.jpg",
