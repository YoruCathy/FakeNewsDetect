Appearing alongside actors Mandy Moore, Sterling K. Brown, and Justin Hartley, Metz plays Kate Pearson, a 30-something struggling with her body image. Since the series' debut in 2016, the character has been a fan-favorite that many viewers have found incredibly relatable. \"You don't realize that somebody who's average or even very fit could relate to someone who's overweight,\" Metz told People in February 2017, \"but it's not about our size \u2014 it's how we look at ourselves and how we feel about ourselves.\"\n\nDespite Metz's on-screen success, we'd wager that most TV fans don't know about the details of the actress' tragic real-life story. From family troubles and heartbreaking issues related to her weight to a failed marriage and financial strain, Metz has gone through a lot over the years. She's overcome a childhood littered with insecurities to emerge into the self-assured woman she is today, but it hasn't been easy for the former American Horror Story star.\n\nKeep reading to learn all about the toughest moments of Metz's personal life. Be warned though \u2014 like This Is Us, Metz's story is a tearjerker.", "images": ["https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/chrissy-metzs-tragic-real-life-story/intro-1521666029.jpg", "https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/chrissy-metzs-tragic-real-life-story/her-father-reportedly-skipped-out-1521666029.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/chrissy-metzs-tragic-real-life-story/intro-1521666029.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/chrissy-metzs-tragic-real-life-story/intro-1521666029.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Surpless"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/114528/chrissy-metzs-tragic-real-life-story/", "title": "Chrissy Metz's tragic real-life story", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/chrissy-metzs-tragic-real-life-story/intro-1521666029.jpg", "title": "Chrissy Metz's tragic real-life story", "description": "Chrissy Metz has gained worldwide fame since starring in This Is Us, in which she plays Kate Pearson, a woman struggling with her body image.
