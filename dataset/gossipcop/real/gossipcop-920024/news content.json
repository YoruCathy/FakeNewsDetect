Paco was a kind, wise, gentle, loving soul,\u201d Wilde captioned a series of black-and-white photos of herself and Paco.\n\nThe shaggy, white dog made frequent appearances on Wilde\u2019s social media accounts, often posing with Elvis, the rescue dog Wilde and husband Jason Sudeikis adopted in July 2017.\n\n\u201cMy heart feels broken right now. All I can ask is that you consider adopting a pup, and loving them with all you\u2019ve got. Here\u2019s to all the incredible friends of Paco who\u2019ve been so kind to him over the years. I am forever grateful,\u201d the mom of two wrote at the end of her goodbye post.\n\nSadly, Paco is one of several celebrity pets to die in 2018. Taylor Lautner, Chelsea Handler, Khloe Kardashian and more have had to say goodbye to their fur babies as well.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Folivia-wilde7.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Folivia-wilde7.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelli Bender"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/pets/olivia-wilde-dog-dies-paco-birthday/", "title": "Olivia Wilde's Dog and 'Best Friend' Paco Dies on Her Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celeb Pets,Dogs,Jason Sudeikis,Olivia Wilde,Pet Deaths", "news_keywords": "Celeb Pets,Dogs,Jason Sudeikis,Olivia Wilde,Pet Deaths", "description": "Wilde wrote in her goodbye to Paco on Instagram that she hopes others make the choice to adopt their next pet", "og": {"title": "Olivia Wilde's Dog and 'Best Friend' Paco Dies on Her Birthday", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/pets/olivia-wilde-dog-dies-paco-birthday/", "description": "Like Chrissy Teigen, Olivia Wilde is going through a pet owner\u2019s most difficult days.
