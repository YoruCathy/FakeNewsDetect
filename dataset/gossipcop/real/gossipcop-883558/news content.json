Why? Oh, \u2019cos she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nInstead she is hurriedly describing her morning at her Malibu estate, Rainbow Land. \u201cI\u2019ve got seven dogs they\u2019re going a little bit berserk per usual,\u201d she says. It\u2019s 10am, but Miley\u2019s been up for hours. \u201cI wake up with the wheels turning so everyone can expect a 7am, 8am call from me every day.\u201d\n\nThis might come as a surprise to the casual admirer of Miley Cyrus as we know her: a weed-smoking hellraiser who denounced gender, twerked with a foam finger and was mostly naked for the best part of three years. It was a path that reached its artful conclusion with 2015\u2019s Milky Milky Milk tour, during which she suckled a male dancer and wore a strap-on dildo for the duration of the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this year, Miley went\u2026 mild. \u2018Malibu\u2019, the first single from new album \u2018Younger Now\u2019, sees her singing the virtues of her California home. Beneath the surface, Miley is still preaching the same liberties \u2013 but in a package that wouldn\u2019t shock a vicar. And that might just be the point\u2026\n\nAfter everything you\u2019ve done recently, putting out something a bit more \u2018normal\u2019 is just about the most subversive thing you could do. Is that the intention?\n\n\u201cYes, actually. I wanted to be more straightforward\u2026 [I\u2019m] saying, \u2018I want to sell records so this is how I\u2019m going to be\u2019. I feel like I have nothing to prove. I think little parts of everyone that I\u2019ve been in my life are starting to come through in this one kind of era of the music that I\u2019m doing, because I really can embrace what I\u2019ve been before rather than trying to distance myself from it.\u201d\n\nYou did recently say of the \u2018Wrecking Ball\u2019 video, \u201cI\u2019m never living that down\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cYou know, I should f**king be grateful every f**king day for that song, and I am. I think people look at things that they\u2019ve done and there is this sense of shame, or \u2018I wish I wouldn\u2019t have done that\u2019 \u2013 not because I\u2019m naked, by the way; it\u2019s because I feel like I\u2019m in a deeper songwriting place\u2026 Lyrically I\u2019m less impressed with that song for me right now. I feel like it doesn\u2019t reflect who I am now, but that\u2019s fine because it\u2019s not supposed to\u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll say the same thing about this record at some point.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this new album reflect about who you are now?\n\n\u201c[Singles] \u2018Malibu\u2019 and \u2018Younger Now\u2019 are obviously two f**king very different visuals in a way, but what binds them together is that they are both me. For \u2018Bangerz\u2019 I was so one way, I was so \u2018This is who I am, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s gonna change it\u2019, and you know, I did that on \u2018[Miley Cyrus & Her] Dead Petz\u2019 too. Now, I think I have more of an open mind where I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, I can be a bunch of different things every day\u2019, I don\u2019t have to be so locked into myself because then I\u2019m putting those walls and borders around myself that I tell everyone else not to give in to.\u201d\n\nYou mentioned \u2018\u2026Dead Petz\u2019. Those shows, the dildo\u2026 Did you see yourself as an art provocateur, or were you just having a laugh?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more that it\u2019s funny, and I think that it\u2019s also normalising. [I wore] the unicorn dildo to normalise women with penises because there are women with penises and [normalising that is] a part of [my charity] Happy Hippie. And that\u2019s a part of allowing people to be sexually free and not having to hide from their sexuality, whether it\u2019s the way that they were born [or] the way that they transitioned. So that was, in a way, political rather than provocative.\u201d\n\nHave we seen the last of the tongue-out, topless Miley, or has she just gone away for a bit?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to answer that. Because I\u2019ve always had a tongue and I\u2019ve always had tits.\u201d\n\nDid it become a bit of a burden, always having to be outrageous?\n\n\u201cYeah, I still feel pressure from myself in a way. I still really want to be an entertainer and show up in my own way and I don\u2019t want to look like anybody else. With the short hair thing, it was an androgynous, sexy feeling, which is what I want people to feel like. I don\u2019t wanna be over-feminised, but I\u2019m not masculine either \u2013 I\u2019m just myself. [What] people don\u2019t really understand [about] gender fluidity is by feeling nothing, I feel everything. So I feel like this record is expressing that more than ever. I really can wake up one day and feel like \u2018Malibu\u2019, but then I can also feel like I want to be Roy Orbison.\u201d\n\nYou really opened up the gender fluidity conversation, to the point where you can dress in \u2018male\u2019 clothes in the \u2018Younger Now\u2019 video and no one even comments. Is that success?\n\n\u201cI got to normalise it a little bit more. I did it in a less aggressive way where it was subliminally allowing all audiences to be a part of it and enjoy it. From the outside, like you said, \u2018\u2026Dead Petz\u2019 wasn\u2019t a record for everyone\u2026 I think it ended up shutting some doors in the way of people making themselves less mentally available to listen. They think, \u2018I\u2019m already pissed off so I\u2019m not listening to that, she\u2019s crazy\u2019. In a way, \u2018Younger Now\u2019 is really about ageism and sexism too because I feel like as women get older it\u2019s so hard, and I\u2019m watching Madonna do it with such grace and such style and people still attack her\u2026 People just want to talk about how she shouldn\u2019t do a f**king cartwheel at the Super Bowl and it\u2019s like, why? Why can\u2019t you still wear a grill, why can\u2019t you still be a part of pop culture?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of iconic women, your godmother, Dolly Parton, is on the album. She mentions Dollywood, which got me thinking: Rainbow Land theme park\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually a genius idea. I like to think that I already live at the Rainbow Land theme park. My house is completely rainbow.\u201d\n\nAnd \u2018Rainbowland\u2019 is also the name of the song you wrote together\u2026\n\n\u201cYep, and it\u2019s also very political. One line is such a Dolly lyric \u2013 it says, \u2018We are rainbows, me and you / Every colour, every hue\u2019. And it\u2019s about all these different races and genders and religions, if we all did come together to create and said, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re different, that\u2019s awesome, let\u2019s not change to be the same, let\u2019s stay different but let\u2019s come together anyway.\u2019 Because a rainbow\u2019s not a rainbow without all the different colours.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned politics a few times, and you were a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders and, later, Hillary Clinton. Where\u2019s the global politics on the album?\n\n\u201cWell, \u2018Inspired\u2019, I wrote that for Hillary Clinton [but] I\u2019m not fighting fire with fire, hate with hate. I\u2019m fighting hate with love. I\u2019m doing this concert this week in Vegas and for \u2018Party In The USA\u2019 the screens will say \u2018education\u2019 and \u2018healthcare\u2019 and \u2018equality\u2019, \u2018justice\u2019, \u2018freedom\u2019, \u2018liberation\u2019, \u2018expression\u2019. These things are what make up our country. It\u2019s not a party in the USA if it\u2019s filled with hate, discrimination, walls, violence, all these things.\u201d\n\nDo you regret saying that you would leave the USA if Trump won?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t leave the country.\u201d\n\nExactly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not f**king leaving the country, that\u2019s some ignorant s**t, that\u2019s dumb. Because that\u2019s me abandoning my country when I think I\u2019ve got a good thing to say to my country. And trust me, I hear every day on my Instagram, \u2018Just leave already! When are you going to leave?\u2019 Well, that\u2019s not going to be any good. Does it really matter where I am? Because wherever I am, my f**king voice is gonna be heard, and I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d\n\nDid you know there\u2019s a university course you can do called \u2018The Sociology of Miley Cyrus\u2019?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard about that.\u201d\n\nApparently it examines identity, entertainment, media and fame using you as a lens. What advice would you give to the students?\n\n\u201cI would say that for what I do there isn\u2019t a divide between fame, music, socials, being who you are, identity. The part of that I think is the most important would be identity and allowing your identity to inspire and to have your music and to have everything that you put out visually to coincide with your identity. And not have, for example, a Hannah Montana life\u2026 Not have the real you and the famous you. Because I think there are people living that\u2026 There are Hannah Montanas in this f**king industry. People are fans of someone who isn\u2019t the person that they are on the inside. And the person that I am on the inside is the person that I project to people on the outside. Does that make sense?\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 plays with her multiple identities. What did you make of that?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know much about it\u2026 I haven\u2019t really heard it.\u201d\n\nI read you\u2019ve never heard an Ed Sheeran song. Is that right?\n\n\u201cI have now, and you know who is the biggest fan? My dad is the biggest f**king Ed Sheeran fan. Every time we see him at a show my dad is freaking out on how talented he is. So now everyone knows my dad is fangirl for Ed Sheeran.\u201d\n\nYour spend a lot of time with your dad, \u2018Achy Breaky Heart\u2019 singer Billy Ray Cyrus, on his farm in Tennessee. Can you milk a cow?\n\n\u201cI could but it\u2019s not on my everyday list that I do.\u201d\n\nNeither is smoking weed any more. Are you still on the wagon?\n\n\u201cOh yeah, but I still think it\u2019s an amazing, medicinal, awesome thing that needs to be legal everywhere.\u201d\n\nDo you find you have more free time than you used to?\n\n\u201cRight now, I just can\u2019t turn my f**king brain off, I\u2019m just creating all the time. That\u2019s the only hard part. I just never get to that state where I\u2019m just going to watch TV.\u201d\n\nShe might not know what happened in the season six cliffhanger of Game Of Thrones, then, but that creative seam has delivered Miley an album that\u2019s pretty clever once you think about it: a sugared pill in which her righteous ideology hides in pop-country ditties. She came in like a wrecking ball. Now she\u2019s line dancing on the rubble.", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus2_press_290917.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus1_Press_290917.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus_Press_280917.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus1_Press_290917-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus1_Press_290917.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Stubbs"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/features/miley-cyrus-younger-now-interview-2145135", "title": "Miley Cyrus: \"Wherever I am, my f**king voice is gonna be heard\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Ahead of new album 'Younger Now', Miley Cyrus talks the burden of being outrageous and writing with godmother Dolly Parton.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus: \"Wherever I am, my f**king voice is gonna be heard\"", "description": "Ahead of new album 'Younger Now', Miley Cyrus talks the burden of being outrageous and writing with godmother Dolly Parton.", "url": "https://www.nme.com/features/miley-cyrus-younger-now-interview-2145135", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus1_Press_290917.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus1_Press_290917.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "tag": "story of the day", "section": "Features", "published_time": "2017-09-29T06:00:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ahead of new album 'Younger Now', Miley Cyrus talks the burden of being outrageous and writing with godmother Dolly Parton.", "title": "Miley Cyrus: \"Wherever I am, my f**king voice is gonna be heard\"", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017_MileyCyrus1_Press_290917.jpg", "creator": "@ztubbz"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/8j9zMok6two?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIdwrnp0g1k?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/My2FRPA3Gf8?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1506664842.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
