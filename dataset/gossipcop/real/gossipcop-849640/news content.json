Kim Kardashian opens up about her eight-hour testimony against the thieves who robbed her at gunpoint in Paris last year in a preview for the Sunday, May 14, episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. See what she had to say in the clip above.\n\nAfter traveling to New York City to testify, the reality TV queen, 36, calls her momager, Kris Jenner, to go over the details. \u201cIt was just a really long thing because you have to explain it to a translator and then the translator has to explain it to the judge,\u201d Kardashian tells Jenner, 60. \u201cThen, she writes it with the clerk and then they have to read what you wrote. You have to do it sentence by sentence.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, assailants violently robbed the Selfish author inside her H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s apartment in the early hours of October 3, 2016, and stole an estimated $10 million in jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring.\n\n\u201cGoing in there, I was so worked up wanting to explain it so quickly and you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Kardashian says in a confessional of her court experience. \u201cYou just have to, like, be really slow and walk through the entire night, like, second by second and that was just really hard.\u201d\n\nThe E! personality also reveals that she was able to see photos of the suspects for the first time since the terrifying incident. \u201cI think it was really interesting to see the faces of everyone,\u201d she continues. \u201cJust by their height and weight, I could tell who from this lineup was in the room with me. I was able to see who confessed. One of them was the guy that was in the room with me and it was very interesting to hear his story and it was pretty similar to my story.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cOf course, there was like a few things they\u2019re not saying to get lesser charges, but they were pretty honest and did tell most of the story exactly like how it happened.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kardashian, she learned that the men tried to rob her during a previous trip to Paris, but decided not to since her husband, Kanye West, was with her at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see what their side of the story is and to hear the background information about how they had been following me and how they attempted to rob me the last time I was in Paris,\u201d the mom of two \u2014 who shares daughter North, 3, and son Saint, 17 months, with West, 39 \u2014 explains in the clip. \u201cBut my husband was with me.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-zoom-aba4550e-3ec8-47b2-ab63-20bf54adcf4b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-zoom-ae417548-c5c1-4130-8298-16150cbbbf80.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-zoom-aba4550e-3ec8-47b2-ab63-20bf54adcf4b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kim-kardashian-opens-up-about-her-eight-hour-testimony-against-paris-robbers-w481890/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Opens Up About Her Eight-Hour Testimony Against Paris Robbers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim Kardashian details her eight-hour testimony against the thieves who robbed her at gunpoint in Paris last October in a preview for the Sunday, May 14, episode of \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 \u2014 watch the clip here", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim K.
