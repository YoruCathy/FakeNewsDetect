{"url": "https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/david-letterman-broke-latenight-tv-1201499877/", "text": "With his off-kilter sensibility (Stupid Pet Tricks?) and his penchant for the oddball (what other host runs across the stage in silhouette before starting a show, or strikes up a telephone relationship with a woman who works in an office across the street?), David Letterman has left everyone who enjoys latenight television in stitches. Now, he\u2019s about to leave them in splinters.\n\nWhen Letterman signs off CBS\u2019 \u201cLate Show\u201dfor the last time early Thursday morning, he will deprive TV of its last direct link to Johnny Carson and an era when just one, then two, hosts could dominate the period. The arrivals of Jimmy Kimmel at ABC, then Jimmy Fallon at NBC, and, soon, Stephen Colbert at CBS have given rise to talk of a third generation of late-night talent (if Carson, not Jack Paar or Steve Allen, is to be seen as the root of this particular tree). A fourth and a fifth are already starting to grow.\n\nCarson was the undisputed king of latenight, and Leno and Letterman merely viceroys over large populaces. These days, the land has no ruler. Simply put, by jumping to CBS from NBC after being passed over for the Carson job on \u201cTonight\u201d \u2013 and tweaking the antics from \u201cLate Night\u201d for a broader audience at 11:30 p.m. \u2013 Letterman signaled the TV business that anyone could make a go of it around midnight.\n\nAnyone has. Thanks to Letterman, the post-local news slot is no longer the main beachhead at evening\u2019s end. He (along with Tom Snyder) proved a younger crowd would tune in for non-traditional antics in the early hours of the morning. And so we have not only Seth Meyers hanging out in Letterman\u2019s old roost, but James Corden stirring things up with a new \u201cLate Late Show\u201d on CBS that has the vibe of a raucous house party. Meantime, ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline\u201d has tried transforming itself into a \u201cyou-are-there\u201d magazine program with decent results.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Since Letterman proved that one could make a viable grab for less than the whole audience and still make a go of it, dozens of others have tried and continue to do so. Time Warner has backed Conan O\u2019Brien since he separated from NBC over the direction of \u201cTonight.\u201d Comedy Central has fared extremely well by launching \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and \u201c@midnight,\u201d though its success will continue to be tested by transition and Jon Stewart\u2019s departure in weeks to come. And all of that doesn\u2019t take into account the many hopefuls who have wrestled their own large or small piece of the end-of-day crowd over the years: Chelsea Handler; Joan Rivers; Pat Sajak; Chevy Chase; Arsenio Hall; Joan Rivers; Phil Cowan and Paul Robin of Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Wilton-North Report\u201d; Craig Kilborn; Craig Ferguson; Pete Holmes; and George Lopez.\n\nThe field will only widen, and ratings will dwindle as audiences disperse. Consider the fact that 42 million people tuned in to see Carson\u2019s final turn on \u201cTonight\u201d in 1992 and just 14.6 million watched Jay Leno\u2019s second adieu to the program in 2014.\n\nThere is still a lot to be said about late-night tradition, which is why CBS is placing so much importance on Stephen Colbert\u2019s debut in September. Many TV networks clearly see opportunity in programs that speak to interesting niches. National Geographic Channel has already lined up astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for a second season of a weekly run of his \u201cStar Talk\u201d podcast and radio show, which examines the ways in which science mixes with popular culture. CMT is readying a June 11th launch for \u201cThe Josh Wolf Show,\u201d which will examine country-music celebrities from Wednesday to Saturday. MTV is preparing two late-night concepts: \u201cGirl Code Live,\u201d which features three female comediennes mixing sketch comedy and celebrity chatter, and \u201cMiddle of the Night Show,\u201d which will force an unsuspecting celebrity to host a late-night program on the spot from his or her home.\n\nWith all of these bespoke efforts in the pipeline, it\u2019s tempting to think the big, broad mainstays of the past are falling out of fashion. Not so.\n\nFallon and Kimmel have revitalized the format by trotting out clever stunts tailor-made for a younger audience that would rather stream the best bits at their leisure (what that dynamic says about the future of candid moments with celebrities is uncertain, though it was heartening recently to see Nicole Kidman confess to a crush on Jimmy Fallon at an earlier time and Fallon acknowledge he had missed her signals during a failed date). Conan O\u2019Brien is also pushing into new frontiers, readying a series of road trips that will feature him mixing it up with interesting people in sundry locales, much as he did during a recent sojourn to Cuba. Chelsea Handler\u2019s coming format experiment on Netflix, which she has said will play like a hipper, faster version of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d will likely draw interest, just like the investigative humor John Oliver has burnished on HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d And Time Warner\u2019s TBS could get into the game in a big way when it launches a new program featuring former \u201cDaily Show\u201d contributor Samantha Bee.\n\nNone of it would be possible without David Letterman, who bravely left a sure thing \u2013 at one moment his \u201cLate Night\u201d was the coolest thing on TV \u2013 for an uncertain one, and pulled it off. Leno won more viewers, but Letterman proved the distinction was in some ways negligible. Now, as TV viewing continues to fragment, advertisers say they are placing more emphasis on audiences that demonstrate true passion, not necessarily the shows that always draw the biggest crowds.\n\nLetterman might have thrived if he continued (particularly if he proved able to maintain the new energy he has mustered in his current program\u2019s last weeks). He has won notice for the most candid chatter in the time slot and is seen by many as the leading voice in bringing the nation back from tragedy after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nIn today\u2019s TV-viewing environment, there is no more King of Late Night \u2013 at least not in the way Johnny Carson was. \u201cI think Johnny Carson was the last King of Late Night,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel told Advertising Age in 2013 just before moving his program to 11:35 p.m. on ABC. \u201cI hope to have a narrow edge on everyone else. That\u2019s really all you can hope for.\u201d\n\nOn May 20th, David Letterman won\u2019t have to bring the house down. He did that in 1993 when he started up with CBS.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/david-letterman.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2015%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fdavid-letterman-broke-latenight-tv-1201499877%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1201499877&comment_count=12", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/david-letterman.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Steinberg"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/david-letterman-broke-latenight-tv-1201499877/", "title": "How David Letterman Broke Latenight TV", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "David Letterman's final \"Late Show\" episode airs May 20.
