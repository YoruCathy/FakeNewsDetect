Nearly a year after being arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct, the 31-year-old actor opened up about learning from his mistakes.\n\n\u201cWhat went on in Georgia was mortifying,\u201d LaBeouf recalled in his cover story for Esquire\u2019s April 2018 issue. \u201cWhite privilege and desperation and disaster \u2026 It came from a place of self-centered delusion \u2026 It was me trying to absolve myself of guilt for getting arrested. I f\u2013ked up.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the Emmy winner was taken into police custody in July 2017 after resisting arrest and going on a racist, profanity-laced tirade. Footage of the incident was later released online, showing him calling the police officers \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cwhore,\u201d in addition to bragging about his \u201cmillionaire lawyers.\u201d Later that month, he apologized in a statement posted on social media and was sent to a court-ordered rehab for 10 weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a buffoon,\u201d LaBeouf told Esquire. \u201cMy public outbursts are failures. They\u2019re not strategic. They\u2019re a struggling motherf\u2013ker showing his ass in front of the world.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got to look at my failures in the face for a while. I need to take ownership of my s\u2013t and clean up my side of the street a bit before I can go out there and work again, so I\u2019m trying to stay creative and learn from my mistakes. I\u2019ve been falling forward for a long time. Most of my life. The truth is, in my desperation, I lost the plot.\u201d\n\nPrior to the incident in Georgia, the Transformers actor was arrested on similar charges in June 2014 after he disrupted a performance of the Broadway revival of Cabaret. He was taken into custody again in January 2017 for allegedly attacking a man outside a New York City protest against President Donald Trump.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shia-labeouf.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/labouf-cover-split-1520875072.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shia-labeouf.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shia-labeouf.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-breaks-silence-2017-arrest/", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Breaks His Silence on 2017 Arrest: \u2018I F\u2013ked Up\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Shia LaBeouf opened up in a new interview about his July 2017 public drunkenness and disorderly conduct arrest in Savannah, Georgia \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Breaks His Silence on 2017 Arrest: \u2018I F--ked Up\u2019", "description": "Shia LaBeouf opened up in a new interview about his July 2017 public drunkenness and disorderly conduct arrest in Savannah, Georgia \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shia-labeouf-breaks-silence-2017-arrest/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-13T15:18:57+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shia-labeouf.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shia-labeouf.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-13T15:20:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-13T15:18:57+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Shia LaBeouf opened up in a new interview about his July 2017 public drunkenness and disorderly conduct arrest in Savannah, Georgia \u2014 read more", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Breaks His Silence on 2017 Arrest: \u2018I F--ked Up\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shia-labeouf.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520954421.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
