It looks like Lamar Odom has learned that the hard way after making some recent shady comments about ex-wife Khloe Kardashian.\n\nLamar expressed his well wishes for Khloe as she prepares to welcome her first child into the world during an appearance on the new series Mancave, which premiered on BET this week. However, the retired NBA player also seemed to take some jabs at his ex. \u201cI still got my shawty\u2019s name still on me, her initials still on me,\u201d the former Los Angeles Lakers star said on Mancave via Us Weekly. \u201cBut for no reason. You know what I\u2019m saying? I understand when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. When she was with her second or third NBA ball player, I could see that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the couple separated in 2013, Khloe would go on to date the Houston Rockets' James Harden, and she is currently expecting her first child with the Cleveland Cavaliers' Tristan Thompson. Khloe and Lamar finalized their divorce in 2016.\n\nWell, Khloe's older sister Kim Kardashian was having none of Lamar's comments. Kim responded to a tweet featuring Lamar's shade with a scorching burn of her own, writing \"or second or third brothel.\" What Kim is referencing here is when Lamar grabbed headlines in 2015 after he was hospitalized after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel.\n\nOr second or third brothel https://t.co/iYYJ1NehOe \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 18, 2018\n\nYou're not the only one clutching your pearls at that clap back. Kim's friend Chrissy Teigen was basically all of us when she read that tweet.\n\n\n\nGAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH EM \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 18, 2018\n\nGaht*. Gaht too excited \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 18, 2018\n\nWe're just going to need to lie down for a little while to take this all in.\n\nSee more of Kim's shady self, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/vanderpump-rules-aftershow-season-8.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-02/gage-edwards-home-construction-jeff.jpg?itok=gQnzHilg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/summer-house-josh-brown-fave-episode.jpg?itok=qa3P0N9y", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-todd-kaela-tucker.jpg?itok=EzzwdqqY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-02/rhoa-aftershow-playlist-promo_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/project-runway-season-18-aftershow.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/708/39/160114_2968810_Khloe_Opens_Up_About_Lamar.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-11/jack-stirrup-kelly-hidge-pregnant.jpg?itok=57tjzieE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/rhonj-season-10-aftershow.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-011918-kim-lamar.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/last-chance-kitchen-playlist-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-02/mercedes-javid-golnesa-gg-baby.jpg?itok=FRVnbv9M", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/644/299/170524_3524342_Plead_the_Fifth_with_Kim_Kardashian_West.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-011918-kim-lamar.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kim-kardashian-reacts-to-khloe-kardashian-shade-from-lamar-odom", "title": "Kim Kardashian Just Shaded Lamar Odom with a Tweet About Brothels and We've Never Seen Her So Savage", "meta_data": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Shades Lamar Odom After Khloe Kardashian Comments | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "When you mess with one member of the Kardashian family, you mess with them all.
