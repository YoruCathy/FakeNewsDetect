For some years, Poland has been slipping into nationalist authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nWhether or not they were dupes, William, Kate & Co. have shown their mastery not only of charm diplomacy but also of \u201cfashion diplomacy,\u201d putting on a stylish display appropriate for historic sites, charities, sporting events and formal receptions.\n\nFrom their arrival at the airport in Poland to their radiant last night appearance at the Ballhaus dance hall in Berlin, they were models of taste, regal grace and impeccable style.\n\nThroughout the trip, the Duchess paid homage to the two countries through a wardrobe that included British, Polish and even Irish designers, many of them in the national colors of their host countries - such as the greatly admired yellow Jenny Packham lace sun dress honoring German colors and the white dresses she wore in Poland.\n\nTheir popularity, particularly in Germany, has been compared to that of any of the best-known pop stars. The 35-year-old duchess was seemingly the favorite: \"Katemania\" was strong, as seen by enthusiastic mobs that despite scorching temperatures awaited their arrivals and departures, screaming her name and wishing for a glimpse.\n\nThe German media, according to the Daily Mail - which called their visit \"die Charmeoffensive,\" dubbed Kate the \"new Princess of Hearts,\" claiming that \u201cshe has the warmth that only William\u2019s mother, Princess Diana, could radiate.\u201d\n\n\u201c'Fur die kids ist sie the Prinzessin der Herzen (For the kids she is the Princess of the hearts),\" Berliner Zeitung declared after she hugged kids during a visit to a children\u2019s charity in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe Duchess was the center of attention, with several children throwing themselves into her arms for a cuddle,\u201d the Mail reported.\n\nOn the last day of their visit Friday before flying home in time to celebrate Prince George\u2019s fourth birthday, they visited the Maritime Museum in Hamburg to celebrate the joint U.K.-German Year of Science, the Airbus facilities and attended a special performance at the Elbphilarmonie Concert Hall.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818819584/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818982572/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/817928806/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820289394/640x434.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819481352/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818724156/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818792716/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818754216/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5e4342aa817e8f02961bf8651d8b4563?s=400&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819750468/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818118606/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819283012/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/815962210/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820289394/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819751688/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818997006/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818819810/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820233914/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818858284/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820082170/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/818819486/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820121724/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819426068/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819298978/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820254760/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/819385522/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/820289394/640x434.jpg?fit=scale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cecilia Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170722002044/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/07/21/kate-middleton-prince-william-and-kids-in-germany-best-pics-of-their-charm-and-fashion-diplomacy/", "title": "Kate Middleton, Prince William And Kids In Germany: Best Pics Of Their Charm And Fashion Diplomacy", "meta_data": {"referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "description": "The world's most popular royal family just did yet again what they do so well -
