The Leftovers was the type of show that always kept me guessing, and not just as to the true nature of the Sudden Departure. With each passing episode, I could never be sure what I\u2019d be getting from the show, whom I\u2019d be spending time with, or where we\u2019d be. It\u2019s a quality that\u2019s been jam-packed into the last three Sundays, when the aforementioned shows, plus American Gods, have all aired new episodes during the nine-o\u2019clock hour. The original Twin Peaks cracked the door for this type of storytelling on TV, and The Leftovers kept that door open for the Peaks revival. It\u2019s a cycle I feel the creators of both shows would appreciate\u2014anybody else catch the Black Lodge vibes during the situation room scenes of \u201cThe Most Powerful Man In The World (And His Identical Twin Brother)\u201d?\u2014where Twin Peaks is now both influence on and successor to The Leftovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF: Twin Peaks, \u201cThe Return, Part 5\u201d\n\nThe cosmic ballet\u2026 goes on: One show takes an elegant bow by letting the mystery be (though I choose to believe Nora); the other forges ahead by deepening its mystery. \u201cThe Return, Part 5\u201d is a feast for anyone who treats their TV shows like puzzles to be solved, a modern phenomenon we can attribute as much to David Lynch and Mark Frost as we can Leftovers and Lost boss Damon Lindelof. From Constance\u2019s autopsy in this episode, we learn that the headless corpse from Ruth Davenport\u2019s apartment had Dougie\u2019s wedding band inside its stomach\u2014which is not the ring we saw slide off Dougie\u2019s hand when he turned into an otherworldly BB in the Red Room. [UPDATE: The original draft of this article conflated Dougie\u2019s wedding band with The Owl Cave ring.] Does that mean the corpse is the body of the real Dougie? And if that\u2019s the case, does that mean there was a fourth party targeting our ill-fated insurance agent, in addition to Doppel-Cooper, the hoods who booby-trapped his car, and the other hoods who tripped the explosives? And if that\u2019s the case, whoever these people are, they keep creating new Lynchian tableaux of horror within the banal: first the scene in Ruth\u2019s bed and then this shot of the neighborhood kid running home, past a single, noticeable shot of flaming wreckage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if that chunk of car (or whatever) wound up in the frame on purpose or by accident. As Emily L. Stephens reminds us in her latest review, one of Twin Peaks\u2019 signature images\u2014Bob in the mirror behind a screaming Sarah Palmer\u2014was a happy accident, so I have to wonder about the creators intentionally sticking any clues to their mystery in the background. In fact, as much as there is to pick apart in \u201cPart 5,\u201d I think it thumbs its nose at the people watching the show as amateur sleuths. If you were looking for deeper meaning in Dr. Jacoby\u2019s golden shovels, you might be disappointed to find out they\u2019re an Alex Jones-style scam meant for the proper digging and depositing of excrement. And if you\u2019re tracking any of the numbers that keep popping into frame, you\u2019ll be similarly frustrated by \u201cPart 5.\u201d The episode begins with the message to the black box in Buenos Aires, Argentina (containing the numbers \u201c159\u201d and \u201c2\u201d), introduces the fact that Dougie worked for the Lucky 7 Insurance Company, then puts a big ol\u2019 \u201c$8.95\u201d behind Shelly and Norma while Becky (Amanda Seyfried) counts her $72. But if you\u2019re looking to unravel some sort of cipher from within the episode, you\u2019re also going to run smack dab into the numerals from the \u201cOrder Now\u201d screen in Dr. Amp\u2019s Gold Shit-Digging Shovel commercial, and then the clock next to the elevator that Dougie\u2019s co-workers shove Coop out of.\n\nYou think you\u2019ve found your way through the maze, but then Twin Peaks throws up a bunch of dead ends. None of which is to say that there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to watch this, or any other show of its kind. But if you\u2019re going to dig your way through Twin Peaks, your shovel better be prepared for more than shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Erik Adams]\n\nErik, it seems clear that anyone watching this show and thinking they\u2019re going to crack some key part of the mystery by studying the numbers is doomed to a fate akin to that of Jim Carrey in The Number 23, and given that he became a tortured saxophone man, I wouldn\u2019t recommend that particular rabbit hole. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the show thumbing its nose at would-be detectives\u2014Lynch isn\u2019t terribly interested in trolling his audience, I suspect\u2014so much as demonstrating a fascination with the search for meaning. So many of his characters and stories are about the desperate quest to make sense of the unknowable, and attempts to wring significance from even the most arbitrary of symbols (another way the pairing with The Leftovers that you cite is so apt), something like numbers continually appearing and seeming to possess additional weight, just feels like Lynch being Lynch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Goaz (left) and Michael Horse (Photo: Suzanne Tenner/Showtime)\n\nWhat\u2019s becoming increasingly interesting is just how distant the happenings within the actual namesake town seem to be from the greater mystery of Dougie Jones, Dale Cooper, and the other country-spanning mysteries. (Now expanded to continents, with the appearance of Buenos Aires\u2014the same place David Bowie\u2019s FBI agent Phillip Jeffries vanished, according to Fire Walk With Me.) With each passing week, it seems clearer that revisiting his fictional town is mostly a way for Lynch to do a bunch of weird stuff he\u2019s had rolling around in his head; and tying it back to his original cast of characters and their attendant stories is only important insofar as it can let him do these other things. Bobby, Andy and Lucy, Shelly and Norma, James, the Horne brothers, and Dr. Jacoby\u2019s conspiracy-theory radio shtick seem to be happening in another world, no matter how much Hawk\u2019s heritage may have something to do with Cooper\u2019s situation. I\u2019ve no doubt they\u2019ll eventually come together in some manner, but I\u2019m more and more convinced it likely won\u2019t be in a way that isn\u2019t as arbitrary and inexplicable as not-Dougie\u2019s strange connection to that statue outside his office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of strange connections, I\u2019m also not convinced these stories are all happening at the same time. There\u2019s nothing to suggest temporal shifts aren\u2019t happening along with the geographical ones, and while some of these narratives are clearly unfolding simultaneously, there\u2019s also evidence others may not be. From the way that Matthew Lillard\u2019s suspected murderer experienced the real killing as a dream unspooling at a different hour to the way the various gangs tracking Dougie seem to mirror one another, there are ways this show is playing with time that imply Cooper\u2019s journey to the stutter-stop room floating in a box in space isn\u2019t the only instance of non-linear continuity we\u2019re seeing. It may have been 25 years here on Earth, but who knows how long Cooper felt his time in the Black Lodge lasted; it\u2019s not quite time as a flat circle, but it does feel like an M.C. Escher drawing now and then.\n\n[Alex McLevy]\n\nOne of the biggest questions I had going into a new season of Twin Peaks was how the show would fare against the instant scrutiny of the recap age\u2014whether the ambiguity that made the original series so memorable could withstand so many knee-jerk Twitter reactions and morning-after analyses, all pulling at its myriad threads. Five episodes in, I think we\u2019re already learning how: Lynch and Frost will just keep introducing newer, knottier threads to the larger tangle, all of which may or may not end up connected when this is over. Right now, it\u2019s hard to divine just how the War of the Coopers is tied to the murder of Ruth Davenport, to Hawk\u2019s reopening of the Laura Palmer case, to the mysterious reappearance of Major Briggs\u2019 fingerprints on Ruth\u2019s corpse, to Jim Belushi\u2019s crime syndicate guy, to Amanda Seyfried\u2019s Laura Palmer-esque relationship troubles, to Dr. Jacoby\u2019s paranoiac libertarian act, to the cigarette-smoking scumbag who threatened to rape Jane Levy\u2019s friend in The Bang Bang, etc. Certainly there are thematic parallels here to characters and events from the original series\u2014most notably Lynch\u2019s usual motifs of duality and innocence corrupted. But look, we\u2019re not even a third of the way through the season, and already these roundtables have pretty much devolved into a litany of disconnected details that we\u2019re struggling to compile and make sense of, followed by reminders to each other not to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m fine with that elliptical nature\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be a Twin Peaks fan if I weren\u2019t\u2014though I will say that this episode was the first time I started to get just a little frustrated by the sprawl. Dougie/Cooper being as-yet-inexplicably targeted by two rival gangs and Belushi\u2019s casino boss now (turning what seemed to be a comic tangent into yet another plot thread) feels like plot overkill at this early point\u2014particularly with the whole hinted-at subplot of the kid and his junkie mom across the street, particularly when there are so many other, more uniquely compelling dramas at hand. Similarly, while I\u2019ve enjoyed Kyle MacLachlan\u2019s dual performance, and it was fun to see Lynch try his hand at some workplace comedy, I\u2019m hoping that the next episode finally sees Cooper making bigger inroads toward awakening from his extraterrestrial catatonia, beyond just remembering that he likes coffee, gazing meaningfully at gunslinging heroes, and perking up at the words \u201cagent\u201d and \u201ccase files.\u201d\n\nAmanda Seyfried (left) and Caleb Landry Jones (Photo: Suzanne Tenner/Showtime)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there were, as always, some incredible individual moments in here: Cooper looking in the mirror as his face warps into Bob; the whole sequence of Seyfried\u2019s Becky, high on love and cocaine, gazing rapturously into the sunlight; the enigma of the magic shrinking Buenos Aires box and \u201cMr. Strawberry.\u201d With scenes like this, even as Twin Peaks defiantly resists being broken down and speculated upon, it\u2019s still an alluring sort of frustration it creates\u2014and this season in particular feels like one of the purest distillations yet of Lynch\u2019s aim to create cinema that replicates the feeling of dreaming. So the best we can do here is try to capture and record those moments like a dream journal, resist the urge to apply waking logic to them, and recognize that whatever we think we understand about them is probably going to be proven wrong.\n\nExcept that creepy kid at the bar is named \u201cRichard Horne\u201d in the credits, so he\u2019s probably Audrey\u2019s son who she had with Evil Cooper, right? Right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Sean O'Neal]\n\n\u201cDamn good joe, huh, Dougie?\u201d After the uncompromising first four episodes, this hour felt similar to the rhythms (if not the accessibility) of classic, soap-operatic Twin Peaks. A couple of months ago, we did an AVQ&A on TV series where the protagonist is also the most interesting character, on which Erik rightly singled out Dale Cooper. For all the kooks and weirdoes who populate the Peaks\u00ad-verse, none of them can match the purity with which the series characterizes Cooper, and there\u2019s something touching about the way the revival both subverts his straight-arrow personality (via the long-haired Doppel-Cooper) and embraces it. As the lime-green-jacketed Dougie Jones, the de-Lodged Dale Cooper guzzles coffee (MacLachlan\u2019s bit with the cup in the elevator is a great piece of small-scale physical comedy) and lights up not only at the words \u201cagent\u201d and \u201ccase file,\u201d but also \u201ccoffee\u201d\u2014the most recognizable traits of Dale Cooper are also apparently the deepest parts of his subconscious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Twin Peaks, \u201cThe Return, Part 5\u201d\n\nWhat I can\u2019t help but note is that Cooper-as-Dougie Jones reminded me visually of Ronald Reagan. Lynch\u2019s politics are rarely talked about in discussions of his art, but he was a Reaganite in the 1980s who has since drifted to the left. (He supported Bernie Sanders in last year\u2019s election.) And this episode\u2014though it continues the impenetrable, ever-expanding nightmare logic of the revival\u2014is about as close as he\u2019s come to out-and-out political satire. The bit with Dr. Jacoby and the gold shovels (\u201cDig yourself out of the shit. $29.99!\u201d) struck me as a more succinct and cogent caricature of Trumpism than all those overextended, trying Saturday Night Live bits put together. And there is, of course, more than a touch of social (and perhaps also political) satire in the way Dougie Cooper blends into his workplace at the insurance office despite his lobotomized behavior. Which is to say that, while part of the beauty of Twin Peaks is how it creates its own world, we can often forget that it\u2019s still addressed at the real one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd how great is that long, silent-movie-starlet close-up of Seyfried blissfully leaning back in the convertible to the sound of the Paris Sisters\u2019 \u201cI Love How You Love Me?\u201d\n\n[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/yoljzhtnahxe1bfmadtn.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/yoljzhtnahxe1bfmadtn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://tv.avclub.com/grab-a-golden-shovel-and-dig-through-part-5-of-twin-pea-1798288243", "title": "Grab a golden shovel and dig through part 5 of Twin Peaks", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/cfeerdkqdvairskc2jmv.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/cfeerdkqdvairskc2jmv.png", "keywords": "TV, Twin Peaks, Roundtable, TV Club", "news_keywords": "TV, Twin Peaks, Roundtable, TV Club", "twitter": {"url": "https://tv.avclub.com/grab-a-golden-shovel-and-dig-through-part-5-of-twin-pea-1798288243", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "AVTVClub", "title": "Grab a golden shovel and dig through part 5 of Twin Peaks", "description": "Last night, in a moment of great TV serendipity, the finale of The Leftovers unspooled on HBO while the fifth chapter of the new Twin Peaks played out on Showtime.
