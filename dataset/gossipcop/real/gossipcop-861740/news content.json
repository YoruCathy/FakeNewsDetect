Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z.\n\nThe businessman, 65, celebrated the babies\u2019 arrival by posting a balloon-covered birthday card to Instagram on Sunday, June 18. \u201cHappy Birthday to the twins! Love, Granddad,\u201d the card read. Knowles captioned the post, \u201cThey\u2019re here! #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happy birthday.\u201d (Knowles is already grandpa to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, and Solange Knowles\u2019 12-year-old son, Julez.)\n\nKnowles\u2019 confirmation, however, angered some of the BeyHive, who thought that the \u201cFormation\u201d singer, 35, should have been the one to announced the twins\u2019 arrival. \u201cBeyonce\u2019s dad had no business telling Beyonce\u2019s announcement. Exactly why he didn\u2019t know she was pregnant until the Instagram post. I can\u2019t,\u201d one tweeter wrote.\n\nThey\u2019re here! .\u2800 .\u2800 .\u2800 #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happybirthday A post shared by Mathew Knowles (@mrmathewknowles) on Jun 18, 2017 at 7:12am PDT\n\n\u201cI really hope you had Beyonce\u2019s permission to announce this because otherwise you are so far out of line,\u201d an Instagram commenter wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s Beyonce\u2019s news and if she felt ready to announce the birth she would have done it by now.\u201d\n\nOthers defended Knowles\u2019 post, though. \u201cIt\u2019s completely alright if the grandfather wants to announce it,\u201d one Instagram commenter wrote. Another Instagram user pointed out, \u201cIt could be the grandparents or the mother or the father. There\u2019s no tradition.\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly previously revealed, the \u201cHold Up\u201d songstress and the Tidal founder, 47, welcomed a baby boy and girl on Tuesday, June 13.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 announced her pregnancy back in February with a flawless maternity shoot. \u201cWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed tow times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes,\u201d she captioned an Instagram photo of herself cradling her bare baby bump.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-matthew-knowles-852af44c-98f4-4443-8948-290df0aa171b.jpg?crop=1px%2C0px%2C1181px%2C621px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-matthew-knowles-inline-86478574-e8b6-415d-b591-33088591c7c8.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-matthew-knowles-852af44c-98f4-4443-8948-290df0aa171b.jpg?crop=1px%2C0px%2C1181px%2C621px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/beyonces-dad-matthew-knowles-confirms-twins-birth-w488578/", "title": "Beyonce\u2019s Dad Mathew Knowles Confirms Twins\u2019 Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Beyonce\u2019s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beyonce\u2019s Dad Confirms Twins\u2019 Arrival \u2014 and the Beyhive Isn't Having It", "description": "Beyonce\u2019s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/beyonces-dad-matthew-knowles-confirms-twins-birth-w488578/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:57:39+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-matthew-knowles-852af44c-98f4-4443-8948-290df0aa171b.jpg?crop=1px%2C0px%2C1181px%2C621px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-matthew-knowles-852af44c-98f4-4443-8948-290df0aa171b.jpg?crop=1px%2C0px%2C1181px%2C621px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-06-19T14:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:57:39+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Beyonce\u2019s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z \u2014 get the details", "title": "Beyonce\u2019s Dad Confirms Twins\u2019 Arrival \u2014 and the Beyhive Isn't Having It", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-matthew-knowles-852af44c-98f4-4443-8948-290df0aa171b.jpg?crop=1px%2C0px%2C1181px%2C621px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497880860.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
