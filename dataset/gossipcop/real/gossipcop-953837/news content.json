Anthony unequivocally disputes the claim.\"\n\nThe allegations against Anderson, 47, were first reported by The Blast.\n\nAn unidentified woman claimed he assaulted her more than a year ago after meeting Anderson at an event he hosted, according to the site.\n\nThe incident, she says, happened the second time they met to discuss future business opportunities.\n\nThe LAPD confirms that Anderson is under investigation.\n\n\u201cAt this point, all we can confirm is that there is an active investigation,\u201d public information director Josh Rubenstein told USA TODAY.\n\nThe alleged victim filed a police report with LAPD's Hollywood Division earlier this year after finding comfort with the #MeToo movement, The Blast reports.\n\nThe accusations come less than two weeks after Anderson received his fourth Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series for \"Black-ish.\"\n\nAnderson previously faced assault allegations in 2004, when a woman claimed Anderson and assistant director Wayne Witherspoon raped her in a trailer on set of \u201cHustle & Flow.\u201d\n\nThe charges against both men were dismissed after a judge ruled there was no probable cause.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/908293b2d99e7b9f3dc4bf153db84514e48dbefa/c=0-77-3719-2178/local/-/media/2018/07/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636678585308486113-AFP-AFP-16M8UT.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/908293b2d99e7b9f3dc4bf153db84514e48dbefa/c=0-77-3719-2178/local/-/media/2018/07/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636678585308486113-AFP-AFP-16M8UT.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/908293b2d99e7b9f3dc4bf153db84514e48dbefa/c=0-77-3719-2178/local/-/media/2018/07/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636678585308486113-AFP-AFP-16M8UT.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/22/black-ish-star-anthony-anderson-denies-womans-assault-allegations/816002002/", "title": "'Black-ish' star Anthony Anderson denies woman's assault allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "'Black-ish' star Anthony Anderson denies woman's assault allegations", "description": "The\u00a0Los Angeles Police Department confirms it is investigating allegations that 'Black-ish' star Anthony Anderson assaulted a woman.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/22/black-ish-star-anthony-anderson-denies-womans-assault-allegations/816002002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/908293b2d99e7b9f3dc4bf153db84514e48dbefa/c=0-77-3719-2178/local/-/media/2018/07/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636678585308486113-AFP-AFP-16M8UT.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Cydney Henderson", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The\u00a0Los Angeles Police Department confirms it is investigating allegations that 'Black-ish' star Anthony Anderson assaulted a woman.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/908293b2d99e7b9f3dc4bf153db84514e48dbefa/c=0-77-3719-2178/local/-/media/2018/07/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636678585308486113-AFP-AFP-16M8UT.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "'Black-ish' star Anthony Anderson denies woman's assault allegations", "description": "The\u00a0Los Angeles Police Department confirms it is investigating allegations that 'Black-ish' star Anthony Anderson assaulted a woman."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532188800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
