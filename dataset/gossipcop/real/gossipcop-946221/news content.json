The 34-year-old opened up about her decision to take a step back from modeling in her cover interview for Net-a-Porter\u2019s digital magazine, The Edit, saying she\u2019s focusing now on her organic skincare line, Kora Organics, thanks to a push from her new hubby, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nSo how is she adjusting to life away from the cameras and inside the Kora offices? Kerr talks all about her newlywed life and the more feminine and masculine roles she and Spiegel (respectively) take on at home.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nImage zoom Photographed by Raf Stahelin, courtesy of The EDIT, NET-A-PORTER\n\n\u201cEvan inspired me,\u201d Kerr old the magazine of her decision to take a break from modeling. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why are you spending your energy working for other companies when you should be focusing on your own? You need to take a risk. If you believe in this, put everything into it.'\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Jada Pinkett Smith Talks Celebrating 20 Years with Will Smith\n\nShe adds: \u201cI\u2019ve modeled for 20 years, it\u2019s just not a priority anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, if an opportunity comes up, I think, \u2018Is this in the best interest of my family?\u2019 and \u2018Will this interrupt Kora?\u2019 If it passes through those two gates, and if the shoot\u2019s in LA, then\u2026\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: They Do! Celebrity Bridesmaids\n\nImage zoom Photographed by Raf Stahelin, courtesy of The EDIT, NET-A-PORTER\n\nHer life these days involves getting her son, Flynn, off to school, working at Kora\u2019s office and getting home in time to cook her family dinner. \u201cMy grandma taught me that men are visual and you need to make a little effort,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when [Evan] comes home, I make sure to have a nice dress on and the candles lit. We make time to have a nice dinner together.\u201d\n\nShe also slips into a slightly different vibe at home than when she\u2019s at the office. \u201cAt work, I\u2019m like, \u2018We need to do this!\u2019 and, \u2018This needs to happen!\u2019 But at home, I slip into my feminine and empower Evan to be in his masculine.\u201d\n\nIf that mindset of Kerr\u2019s sounds familiar, she told The Edit back in 2013 something very similar when describing her relationship with now ex-husband Orlando Bloom.\n\n\u201cI am quite dominant in my career, so what really works for me when I come home, is to relax more into the feminine side,\u201d she said four years ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re really an alpha female, you don\u2019t allow [your partner] to have the space to feel like the man in the relationship. Maybe I am too traditional, but men feel important when you ask for their help, instead of thinking you can do it all on your own.\u201d\n\nTo see The Edit\u2018s full interview, go to net-a-porter.com or download the free Edit app at the App Store and Google Play.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmiranda-kerr_cover-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1527&h=799&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-1-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1527&h=799&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-2-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/miranda-kerr-life-with-evan-spiegel/", "title": "Miranda Kerr Gushes About Traditionally 'Feminine' Role in Marriage to Evan Spiegel - Just As She Did About Orlando Bloom in 2013", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Miranda Kerr,Models,News,Style News", "news_keywords": "Miranda Kerr,Models,News,Style News", "description": "With the support of new husband Evan Spiegel, she's focusing more on her business these days", "og": {"title": "Miranda Kerr Gushes About Traditionally 'Feminine' Role in Marriage to Evan Spiegel - Just As She Did About Orlando Bloom in 2013", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/miranda-kerr-life-with-evan-spiegel/", "description": "Every major model is currently in N.Y.C. to hit the runway at New York Fashion Week, but one very notable catwalk star is missing \u2014&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1527&h=799&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-2-2000.jpg", "width": 1527, "height": 799}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/miranda-kerr-life-with-evan-spiegel/", "description": "With the support of new husband Evan Spiegel, she's focusing more on her business these days", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-2-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/miranda-kerr-life-with-evan-spiegel/", "title": "Miranda Kerr Gushes About Traditionally 'Feminine' Role in Marriage to Evan Spiegel - Just As She Did About Orlando Bloom in 2013", "description": "With the support of new husband Evan Spiegel, she's focusing more on her business these days", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1527&h=799&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fmk-2-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
