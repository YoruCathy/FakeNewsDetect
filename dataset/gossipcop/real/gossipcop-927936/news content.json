Brooke Burke opened up about filing for divorce from David Charvet during her visit to The Steve Harvey Show on Tuesday, April 17.\n\nThe 46-year-old model and TV host seemed to be in good spirits as she shared her outlook on marriage and spoke candidly about her decision to end her own union.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it about learning along the way? I mean, you know, I just recently filed for divorce so this is all very fresh and vulnerable for me,\u201d Burke revealed. \u201cBut my goal and my prayer is to move forward with an open heart and to take beautiful memories and to learn from the challenges that I faced and not to bring all the baggage, which is mine, and pass it on to someone else whenever that day comes.\u201d\n\nAdded the Wild On! alum: \u201cIt\u2019s easier said than done, ask me in six months or so, but I\u2019m not taking [the baggage] with me.\u201d\n\nBurke filed for divorce from the Melrose Place star, 45, on April 6 after six years of marriage. She wrote about the split on her ModernMoms blog three days later, admitting that she is \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the separation \u201cbecause I loved being married. It took me a long time to differentiate between giving up and letting go, and even longer to recognize when it was time to do so.\u201d\n\nThe author noted that nothing \u201csensational\u201d or \u201cscandalous\u201d contributed to the breakup and the former couple are committed to finding \u201cnew ways to remain a loving family\u201d together.\n\nBurke and Charvet started dating in 2006 and tied the knot in August 2011. They share two children together, daughter Heaven Rain, 11, and son Shaya Braven, 10. Burke and her first husband, Garth Fisher, are parents to daughter Neriah, 18, and Sierra Sky, 16.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorce.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brooke-burke-opens-up-about-david-charvet-divorce/", "title": "Brooke Burke Opens Up About David Charvet Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Brooke Burke spoke candidly about filing for divorce from David Charvet on the Tuesday, April 17, episode of \u2018The Steve Harvey Show\u2019 \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brooke Burke Talks David Charvet Divorce", "description": "Brooke Burke spoke candidly about filing for divorce from David Charvet on the Tuesday, April 17, episode of \u2018The Steve Harvey Show\u2019 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brooke-burke-opens-up-about-david-charvet-divorce/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-17T22:06:29+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Brooke Burke spoke candidly about filing for divorce from David Charvet on the Tuesday, April 17, episode of \u2018The Steve Harvey Show\u2019 \u2014 watch", "title": "Brooke Burke Talks David Charvet Divorce", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524002789.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
