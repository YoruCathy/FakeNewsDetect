The little sister to queen bee Regina is first shown emulating Kelis's dance moves in the music video for her hit song \"Milkshake\" when Cady enters the palatial George home, and is later glimpsed playing along with a Girls Gone Wild episode by lifting up her shirt. These moments are emblematic of the movie's often very adult sense of humor (the MPAA originally wanted to slap it with an 'R' rating, and several jokes had to be toned down in order to achieve that all-important PG-13).\n\nThere was a sense that Kylie was about to follow in Regina's footsteps in a big way, or that she may turn out even worse. While we don't know the fate of her character, that's certainly not the case for Canadian Nicole Crimi who played the role. Rather than getting into trouble or growing up too fast, Crimi focused on schooling, charity work, and seeing the world. Naturally, Crimi is also still a Mean Girls super-fan at heart. And she grew up to be, like, really pretty, too.", "images": ["https://img.thelist.com/img/thelist_logo_black_2.svg", "https://img2.thelist.com/img/gallery/what-regina-georges-little-sister-from-mean-girls-looks-like-now/she-stepped-back-from-acting-1534273348.jpg", "https://img.thelist.com/img/thelist_icon_black.svg", "https://img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/what-regina-georges-little-sister-from-mean-girls-looks-like-now/intro-1534273348.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/what-regina-georges-little-sister-from-mean-girls-looks-like-now/intro-1534273348.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joey Keogh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thelist.com/131230/what-regina-georges-little-sister-from-mean-girls-looks-like-now/", "title": "What Regina George's little sister from Mean Girls looks like now", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/what-regina-georges-little-sister-from-mean-girls-looks-like-now/intro-1534273348.jpg", "title": "What Regina George's little sister from Mean Girls looks like now", "description": "Kylie George may have only had a couple short scenes in Mean Girls, but she made her mark.
