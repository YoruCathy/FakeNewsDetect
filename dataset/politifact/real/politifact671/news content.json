Proud of the son you are. Proud of the father you\u2019ve become. And I\u2019m so proud of my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, and my wife Jill, the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time.\n\n\n\nIt is an honor to share this stage tonight with President Clinton. And last night, it was moving to watch Hillary, one of the great leaders of our party, a woman who has made history and will continue to make history: my colleague and my friend, Senator Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nAnd I am honored to represent our first state\u2014my state\u2014Delaware.\n\n\n\nSince I\u2019ve never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nLet me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution, no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be: \u201cThe vice president\u2019s office is on the phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarack Obama and I took very different journeys to this destination, but we share a common story. Mine began in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then Wilmington, Delaware. With a dad who fell on hard economic times, but who always told me: \u201cChamp, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\u201d\n\n\n\nI wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her children\u2014all the children who flocked to our house\u2014that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.\n\n\n\nFailure at some point in everyone\u2019s life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn\u2019t get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day.\n\n\n\nAfter the accident, she told me, \u201cJoey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.\u201d And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others.\n\n\n\nMy mother\u2019s creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyone\u2019s equal, and everyone is equal to you.\n\n\n\nMy parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our family. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try.\n\n\n\nThat was America\u2019s promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it.\n\n\n\nBut today that American dream feels as if it\u2019s slowly slipping away. I don\u2019t need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they\u2019re talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed.\n\n\n\nLike millions of Americans, they\u2019re asking questions as profound as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask:\n\n\n\n* Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone?\n\n* Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car?\n\n* Winter\u2019s coming. How we gonna pay the heating bills?\n\n* Another year and no raise?\n\n* Did you hear the company may be cutting our health care?\n\n* Now, we owe more on the house than it\u2019s worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?\n\n* How are we gonna be able to retire?\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the America that George Bush has left us, and that\u2019s the future John McCain will give us. These are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck. These are common stories among middle-class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays.\n\n\n\nThat promise is the bedrock of America. It defines who we are as a people. And now it\u2019s in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesn\u2019t get it.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.\n\n\n\nYou know, I believe the measure of a man isn\u2019t just the road he\u2019s traveled; it\u2019s the choices he\u2019s made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But that\u2019s not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone.\n\n\n\nAnd he made their lives the work of his life. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019ve been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That\u2019s how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. It\u2019s dignity. It\u2019s respect. It\u2019s about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: we\u2019re going to be ok.\n\n\n\nBecause Barack made that choice, 150,000 more children and parents have health care in Illinois. He fought to make that happen. And because Barack made that choice, working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work. He got it done.\n\n\n\nAnd when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve.\n\n\n\nYou can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.\n\n\n\nI watched how he touched people, how he inspired them, and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all: We don\u2019t have to accept a situation we cannot bear.\n\n\n\nWe have the power to change it. That\u2019s Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what he will do for this country. He\u2019ll change it.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain is my friend. We\u2019ve known each other for three decades. We\u2019ve traveled the world together. It\u2019s a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me.\n\n\n\nBut I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country. For example,\n\n\n\nJohn thinks that during the Bush years \u201cwe\u2019ve made great progress economically.\u201d I think it\u2019s been abysmal.\n\n\n\nAnd in the Senate, John sided with President Bush 95 percent of the time. Give me a break. When John McCain proposes $200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate America, $1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies, but no relief for 100 million American families, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nEven today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history\u2014a half trillion dollars in the last five years\u2014he wants to give them another $4 billion in tax breaks. But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy: solar, wind, biofuels. That\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nMillions of jobs have left our shores, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there. That\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nHe voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage. For people who are struggling just to get to the next day, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nAnd when he says he will continue to spend $10 billion a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $80 billion, that\u2019s not change; that\u2019s more of the same.\n\n\n\nThe choice in this election is clear. These times require more than a good soldier; they require a wise leader, a leader who can deliver change\u2014the change everybody knows we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will deliver that change. Barack Obama will reform our tax code. He\u2019ll cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people who draw a paycheck. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority, creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out-compete us tomorrow. He\u2019ll invest in the next generation of teachers. He\u2019ll make college more affordable. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will bring down health care costs by $2,500 for the typical family, and, at long last, deliver affordable, accessible health care for all Americans. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nBarack Obama will put more cops on the streets, put the \u201csecurity\u201d back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. That\u2019s the change we need.\n\n\n\nAs we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, we\u2019ve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia\u2019s challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia. Barack Obama and I will end this neglect. We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we\u2019ll help the people of Georgia rebuild.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this Administration\u2019s policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this.\n\n\n\nNow, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isn\u2019t ready to protect our national security. Now, let me ask you: whose judgment should we trust? Should we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he said only three years ago, \u201cAfghanistan\u2014we don\u2019t read about it anymore because it\u2019s succeeded\u201d? Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?\n\n\n\nThe fact is, al-Qaida and the Taliban\u2014the people who actually attacked us on 9/11\u2014have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack\u2019s call for more troops.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nShould we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change.\n\n\n\nNow, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because that\u2019s the best way to advance our security.\n\n\n\nAgain, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nShould we trust John McCain\u2019s judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq\u2014that we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?\n\n\n\nNow, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.\n\n\n\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.\n\n\n\nFolks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they\u2019ll look to us again, they\u2019ll trust us again, and we\u2019ll be able to lead again.\n\n\n\nJill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey. When I look at their young children\u2014and when I look at my grandchildren\u2014I realize why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here for their future.\n\n\n\nAnd I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington. I am here for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers\u2014the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures.\n\n\n\nOur greatest presidents\u2014from Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy\u2014they all challenged us to embrace change. Now, it\u2019s our responsibility to meet that challenge.\n\n\n\nMillions of Americans have been knocked down. And this is the time as Americans, together, we get back up. Our people are too good, our debt to our parents and grandparents too great, our obligation to our children is too sacred.\n\n\n\nThese are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. I\u2019m ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is America\u2019s time.\n\n\n\nMay God bless America and protect our troops.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20080828144739im_/http://www.demconvention.com/favicon.ico", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080828144739im_/https://cts.vresp.com/s.gif?h=bb7e07434e", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080828144739im_/http://www.demconvention.com/themes/dnc/images/menu-arrow.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080828144739im_/http://www.demconvention.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Democratic National Convention", "meta_data": {"generator": "SilverStripe 2.0 - http://www.silverstripe.com", "description": "Beau, I love you.
