This table breaks out Department budget totals by discretionary and mandatory spending. Spending for discretionary programs is decided in the annual appropriations process. In contrast, spending for mandatory programs is usually a function of the authorizing statutes creating the programs, and generally is not affected by appropriations laws. To learn more about discretionary and mandatory spending in the Education Department, please see Budget Process and Calendar. Please note: the FY 2006 and FY 2007 appropriations shown on this table include the one-time emergency supplemental funds appropriated for recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "images": ["http://www.ed.gov/images/facebook.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/ed_gl_rs_topics.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/email.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/ed_gl_rs_dline.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/languageicon.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/ed-gov-hat.png", "http://www.ed.gov/images/twitter.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/spacer.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/ed_gl_bullet.gif", "http://www.ed.gov/images/rss.gif"], "top_img": "http://www.ed.gov/images/ed-gov-hat.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "U.S. Department of Education Budget History", "meta_data": {"ED.office": "Office of the Deputy Secretary (ODS)", "DC.identifier": "http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/history/index.html", "DC.date.valid": "2018-10-26", "DC.publisher": "US Department of Education (ED)", "DC.format": "text/HTML", "DC.title": "U.S. Department of Education Budget History", "DC.language": "en", "DC.description": "Detailed tables showing the budget history of the U.S. Department of Education from FY 1980 to the FY 2018 President's Budget, by major program, and showing State allocations by State and by program from FY 1980-2017.", "description": "Detailed tables showing the budget history of the U.S. Department of Education from FY 1980 to the FY 2018 President's Budget, by major program, and showing State allocations by State and by program from FY 1980-2017.", "DC.subject": "appropriations; State allocations; Education funding", "keywords": "Budgets; Budgeting; Federal Aid; Federal Programs; State Federal Aid; Federal State Relationship; appropriations; State allocations; Education funding", "DC-ED.audience": "Congress; Federal Funds Recipients and Applicants; State Education Agencies", "DC.type": "Budget Materials", "DC.date": "2019-03-18", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.ed.gov", "summary": ""}
