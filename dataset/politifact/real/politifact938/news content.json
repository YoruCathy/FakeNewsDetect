The agency relies on cooperation from food makers to ensure the safety of the food supply even when those makers are suspected of crimes.\n\nSome Democrats in Congress have vowed to change this by giving the F.D.A. more authority, and the agency\u2019s critics say it is too timid with the power it has.\n\nOn Monday, President Obama promised a \u201ccomplete review of F.D.A. operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the F.D.A. has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch,\u201d Mr. Obama said in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gardiner Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2009-02-03T03:57:31.000Z", "modified": "2009-02-03T03:57:10.000Z", "section": "Health", "tag": "Recalls and Bans of Products", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 1231546923693, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/116c8656-0974-58d1-b637-a7d7c5703980", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/54967bb241d74f99aff38fdfb5b84e1b", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Gardiner Harris", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "Peanut Corporation of America,Salmonella,Bacteria,Peanut,Food Safety,Recalls and Bans", "pdate": 20090202, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "type": "article", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "title": "Peanut Product Recall Took Company Approval", "description": "Federal health officials needed the Peanut Corporation of America\u2019s permission before announcing a recall of its products, which may have delayed contamination warnings.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/116c8656-0974-58d1-b637-a7d7c5703980"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "SCG": "policy", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/116c8656-0974-58d1-b637-a7d7c5703980", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/policy/03peanut.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1233590400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
