Furthermore, the Great Recession came on the heels of one of the worst business cycles (2000-2007) on record in terms of job creation, one in which the income of the median working-age household fell $2,113.\n\nThus, the typical working-age household brought in roughly $6,300 less in 2010 than it did in 2000, a more than 10 percent decline. A lost decade, indeed.\n\n***\n\nClick on the figure to enlarge\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20111107234746im_/http://www.epi.org/m/?src=http://www.epi.org/files/2011/blog-biophotos/heidi2.jpg&w=70&h=90", "https://web.archive.org/web/20111107234746im_/http://www.epi.org/files//household_wage.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20111107234746im_/http://www.epi.org/files//household_wage.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Posted September", "At Am"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20111107234746/http://www.epi.org/blog/lost-decade-working-age-household-income/", "title": "Already a lost decade: Working-age household income down more than 10% since 2000", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
