A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,\u201d Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201d\n\nThe al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.\n\n\u201cISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups \u2014 they don\u2019t want Trump in office,\u201d said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. \u201cThey want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.\u201d ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.\n\nSarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is \u201cscared to death of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a threat to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump\u2019s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cThe terrorists fear Trump right now. They\u2019re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word \u201chell,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nIn the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.\n\n\u201cI would hate to do it, but it\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred \u2014 the absolute hatred \u2014 is coming from these areas,\u201d Trump said in an interview on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump\u2019s language aids jihadists.\n\n\u201cIf you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out \u2014 video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,\u201d Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. \u201c \u2018No Muslims coming to the United States,\u2019 other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements \u2014 it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, Clinton added, \u201clights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.\u201d\n\nTrump responded to Clinton\u2019s assertion by calling her \u201ca liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another Hillary lie,\u201d Trump said on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d late last month. \u201cShe\u2019s a liar, and everybody knows that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDavid Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TsOGLeyH_YBZhaJvr8s2Ts4cVjo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UXVZJ7BJJ46BXDKKVESRWTO6WI.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/45bcfb5e-8b25-4d83-9c6b-61fc39b42d63.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TsOGLeyH_YBZhaJvr8s2Ts4cVjo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UXVZJ7BJJ46BXDKKVESRWTO6WI.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Holley", "Technology Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/02/donald-trump-featured-in-new-jihadist-recruitment-video/", "title": "Donald Trump featured in new jihadist recruitment video", "meta_data": {"description": "The video includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/02/donald-trump-featured-in-new-jihadist-recruitment-video/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TsOGLeyH_YBZhaJvr8s2Ts4cVjo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UXVZJ7BJJ46BXDKKVESRWTO6WI.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump featured in new jihadist recruitment video", "description": "The video includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump featured in new jihadist recruitment video", "description": "The video includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country"}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-28T11:57:48.105Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1451664000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
