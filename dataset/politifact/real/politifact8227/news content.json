How things turn out will likely depend on outreach efforts and states\u2019 decisions on expanding Medicaid. Commonwealth Fund Health Insurance Tracking Survey data from 2011 and 2013 show increasing awareness among young adults of the 2010 requirement that health plans cover children under age 26. Of the estimated 15 million young adults enrolled in a parent\u2019s plan in the prior 12 months, 7.8 million would not likely have been eligible to enroll prior to the law. Still, only 27 percent of 19-to-29-year-olds are aware of the marketplaces. Meanwhile, most uninsured young adults living below poverty will not have access to subsidized public or private insurance in states opting out of the Medicaid expansion.\n\nCitation", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Issue-Briefs/2013/Aug/~/media/Images/Infographics/Collins_Young Adults 120.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/images/icon_facebook.png?w=16&h=18&as=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/images/icon_email.png?w=16&h=18&as=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/images/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://commonwealthfund.122.2o7.net/b/ss/cmnfunddev/1/H.22.1--NS/0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/images/icon_twitter.png?w=16&h=18&as=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/images/icon_rss.png?w=16&h=18&as=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425im_/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Issue-Briefs/2013/Aug/~/media/Images/Infographics/Collins_Young Adults 120.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130825005425/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Issue-Briefs/2013/Aug/Covering-Young-Adults-Under-the-Affordable-Care-Act.aspx", "title": "Covering Young Adults Under the Affordable Care Act: The Importance of Outreach and Medicaid Expansion", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "69aed5ff6b1bc7f6b119a48dc4b9d6bd"}, "Title": "Covering Young Adults Under the Affordable Care Act: The Importance of Outreach and Medicaid Expansion", "description": "Data from the Commonwealth Fund Health Insurance Tracking Surveys of Young Adults, conducted in November 2011 and March 2013, suggest that as young adults (ages 19\u201329) gain awareness of the new coverage options available in January 2014, they will eventually enroll in large numbers.", "Keywords": "AARP, Commonwealth, Fund, SCAN, Foundation, health, Older,Adults, Physical, Disabilities, Family, Caregivers, healthcare, Long, Term, long-term, state, scorecard", "Date": "2013-08-21", "ObjectType": "Issue Brief", "ItemGuid": "1419DC78-7E97-4143-B51B-C63433B1A646", "EditorsChoice": 0}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
