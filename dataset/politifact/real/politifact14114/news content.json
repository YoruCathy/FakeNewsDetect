What follows is a lightly edited transcript.\n\nThe Economist: Could we start with the economy?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nWhat is Trumponomics and how does it differ from standard Republican economics?\n\nWell it\u2019s an interesting question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been asked quite that way. But it really has to do with self-respect as a nation. It has to do with trade deals that have to be fair, and somewhat reciprocal, if not fully reciprocal. And I think that\u2019s a word that you\u2019re going to see a lot of, because we need reciprocality in terms of our trade deals. We have nations where\u2026they\u2019ll get as much as 100% of a tax or a tariff for a certain product and for the same product we get nothing, OK? It\u2019s very unfair. And the very interesting thing about that is that, if I said I\u2019m going to put a tax on of 10%, the free-traders, somewhat foolishly, they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, he\u2019s not a free-trader\u201d, which I am, I\u2019m absolutely a free-trader. I\u2019m for open trade, free trade, but I also want smart trade and fair trade. But they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe\u2019s not a free-trader,\u201d at 10%. But if I say we\u2019re putting a reciprocal tax on, it may be 62% or it may be 47%, I mean massive numbers, and nobody can complain about it. It\u2019s really sort of an amazing thing.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story. It very much has to do with trade. We have so many bad trade deals. To a point where I\u2019m not sure that we have any good trade deals. I don\u2019t know who the people are that would put us into a NAFTA, which was so one-sided. Both from the Canada standpoint and from the Mexico standpoint. So one-sided. Wilbur [Ross, the secretary of commerce] will tell you that, you know, like, at the court in Canada, we always lose. Well, the judges are three Canadians and two Americans. We always lose. But we\u2019re not going to lose any more. And so it\u2019s very, very unfair.\n\nTrump on Trumponomics:Nationalism plus flexibility\n\nLeader:The impulsiveness and shallowness of America\u2019s president threaten the economy as well as the rule of law\n\nBriefing 1:Donald Trump\u2019s economic strategy\n\nBriefing 2:The contradiction at the heart of Trumponomics\n\nBriefing 3:What Donald Trump means by fair trade\n\nNow at the same time I have a very good relationship with Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] and a very good relationship with the president of Mexico. And I was going to terminate NAFTA last week, I was all set, meaning the six-month termination. I was going to send them a letter, then after six months, it\u2019s gone. But the word got out, they called and they said, we would really love to\u2026they called separately but it was an amazing thing. They called separately ten minutes apart. I just put down the phone with the president of Mexico when the prime minister of Canada called. And they both asked almost identical questions. \u201cWe would like to know if it would be possible to negotiate as opposed to a termination.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, it is. Absolutely.\u201d So, so we did that and we\u2019ll start.\n\nWe have a problem because we have a ridiculous provision in NAFTA that we have, you know, to go on the fast track. Fast track is the slowest track I\u2019ve ever seen. To go on the fast track you have to give notice. Well we gave notice 70 days ago. It\u2019s called a cooling-off period, OK? But that\u2019s not the way life works because when they call and they want to make a deal, I don\u2019t want to have to wait a hundred days. So I put the papers in almost 70 days ago, to get the approval for fast track in Congress. And they still haven\u2019t given me approval. And the reason they haven\u2019t is because our trade negotiator, who, as you know, the provision goes with your negotiator. It doesn\u2019t go from the time you put it in, it goes with your negotiator. So he just got approved. He\u2019ll be in sometime, I guess next week?\n\nSteve Mnuchin: Yep, yep.\n\nPresident Trump: And the clock starts ticking. But here you have two people calling saying, \u201cCan we negotiate?\u201d I say yes and I have to wait for a hundred days. I don\u2019t know what a hundred days is going to be like. What\u2019s it going to be like? So NAFTA\u2019s a horrible one-sided deal that\u2019s cost us millions and millions of jobs and cost us tens of billions of dollars.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re imagining a pretty big renegotiation of NAFTA. What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nBig isn\u2019t a good enough word. Massive.\n\nHuge?\n\nIt\u2019s got to be. It\u2019s got to be.\n\nWhat would it look like? What would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nNo, it\u2019s gotta be. Otherwise we're terminating NAFTA.\n\nWhat would a fair NAFTA look like?\n\nI was all set to terminate, you know? And this wasn\u2019t like\u2026this wasn\u2019t a game I was playing. I\u2019m not playing\u2026you know, I wasn\u2019t playing chess or poker or anything else. This was, I was, I\u2019d never even thought about\u2026it\u2019s always the best when you really feel this way. But I was\u2026I had no thought of anything else, and these two guys will tell you, I had no thought of anything else but termination. But because of my relationship with both of them, I said, I would like to give that a try too, that\u2019s fine. I mean, out of respect for them. It would\u2019ve been very disrespectful to Mexico and Canada had I said, \u201cI will not.\u201d\n\nBut Mr President, what has to change for you not to withdraw?\n\nWe have to be able to make fair deals. Right now the United States has a 70\u2014almost a $70bn trade deficit with Mexico. And it has about a $15bn dollar trade deficit with Canada. The timber coming in from Canada, they\u2019ve been negotiating for 35 years. And it\u2019s been\u2026it\u2019s been terrible for the United States. You know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just been terrible. They\u2019ve never been able to make it.\n\nDoes that $70bn deficit have to come to zero to be fair?\n\nNot necessarily. And certainly it can come over a, you know, fairly extended period of time, because I\u2019m not looking to shock the system. But it has to become at least fair. And no, it doesn\u2019t have to immediately go to zero. But at some point would like to get it at zero, where sometimes we can be up and sometimes they can be up.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about reciprocal taxes. Do you imagine that with lots of countries on lots of products or is that a negotiating tool?\n\nNo, I think it can be conceivably with lots of countries. The thing that\u2019s bad about the hundred days is, I said the other day, I said, \u201cWhen do we start this negotiation?\u201d They said, \u201cSir, it hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\u201d because it goes with [Robert] Lighthizer, who\u2019s our, you know, our representative, who I think is going to do a very good job. I said, \u201cYou must be kidding.\u201d So it\u2019s a real deficit. Now that\u2019s a NAFTA thing. Because everything in NAFTA is bad. That\u2019s bad, everything\u2019s bad. But in the case of South Korea we have a deal that was made by Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a horrible deal. And that is the five-year anniversary and it\u2019s up for renegotiation and we\u2019ve informed them that we\u2019ll negotiate. And again, we want a fair deal. We don\u2019t want a one-sided deal our way but we want fair deals. And if we can have fair deals our country is going to do very well.\n\nSome people think this is a negotiating tactic\u2014that you say very dramatic things but actually you would settle for some very small changes. Is that right?\n\nNo, it\u2019s not, really not a negotiation. It\u2019s really not. No, will I settle for less than I go in with? Yes, I mean who wouldn\u2019t? Nobody, you know, I always use the word flexibility, I have flexibility. [Goes off the record.] [Our] relationship with China is long. Of course by China standards, it\u2019s very short [laughter], you know when I\u2019m with [Xi Jinping], because he\u2019s great, when I\u2019m with him, he\u2019s a great guy. He was telling me, you know they go back 8,000 years, we have 1776 is like modern history. They consider 1776 like yesterday and they, you know, go back a long time. They talk about the different wars, it was very interesting. We got along great. So I told them, I said, \u201cWe have a problem and we\u2019re going to solve that problem.\u201d But he wants to help us solve that problem.\n\nNow then you never know what\u2019s going to happen. But they said to me that on the currency manipulation, \u201cDonald Trump has failed to call China a currency manipulator\u201d. Now I have to understand something. I\u2019m dealing with a man, I think I like him a lot. I think he likes me a lot. We were supposed to meet for ten minutes and they go to 40-person meetings, OK, in Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And the ten minutes turned out to be three hours, alone, the two of us. The next day it was supposed to be ten minutes and then we go to our 40-person meeting. That, too, he was, no\u2026because you guys were waiting for a long time. That ten minute meeting turned out to be three hours. Dinner turned out to be three hours. I mean, he\u2019s a great guy.\n\nNow, with that in mind, he\u2019s representing China and he wants what\u2019s best for China. But so far, you know, he\u2019s been, he\u2019s been very good. But, so they talk about why haven\u2019t you called him a currency manipulator? Now think of this. I say, \u201cJinping. Please help us, let\u2019s make a deal. Help us with North Korea, and by the way we\u2019re announcing tomorrow that you\u2019re a currency manipulator, OK?\u201d They never say that, you know the fake media, they never put them together, they always say, he didn\u2019t call him a currency [manipulator], number one. Number two, they\u2019re actually not a currency [manipulator]. You know, since I\u2019ve been talking about currency manipulation with respect to them and other countries, they stopped.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right, as soon as the president got elected they went the other way.\n\nOne last question on trade. Do you think you\u2019ve permanently changed the Republican Party\u2019s position on trade?\n\nNo. Because there\u2019ll always be someone that comes along with another idea but it\u2019s not a better idea. We have the better idea. But yeah, I think that a lot of the, like for instance today, health care. Very big thing. Very big. And it wasn\u2019t two bites of the apple. It was one bite. Somebody set a time limit and that was mistake, I said never set a time limit but somebody set a time limit. So when they didn\u2019t meet that time limit they said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it there\u201d, well, they shouldn\u2019t have set a time limit.\n\nOn another element of Trumponomics, immigration\u2026\n\nRight.\n\nDo you want to curb legal immigration?\n\nOh sure, you know, I want to stop illegal immigration.\n\nAnd what about legal immigration? Do you want to cut the number of immigrants?\n\nOh legal, no, no, no. I want people to come into the country legally. No, legally? No. I want people to come in legally. But I want people to come in on merit. I want to go to a merit-based system. Actually two countries that have very strong systems are Australia and Canada. And I like those systems very much, they\u2019re very strong, they\u2019re very good, I like them very much. We\u2019re going to a much more merit-based system. But I absolutely want talented people coming in, I want people that are going to love our country coming in, I want people that are going to contribute to our country coming in. We want a provision at the right time, we want people that are coming in and will commit to not getting\u2026not receiving any form of subsidy to live in our country for at least a five-year period.\n\nBut the numbers of those people could be as high as the numbers that are coming in legally now? You\u2019re not looking to reduce the numbers?\n\nOh yeah, no, no, no, no, we want people coming in legally. No, very strongly. Now they\u2019re going to be much more strongly vetted as you see. You know, we\u2019ve broken the all-time record [of detentions at the border] by many times, 73, we\u2019re up to 73, it\u2019s going to go up to almost 80% at the border, we\u2019ve\u2026you know, really stopped it. We also want farm workers to be able to come in. You know, we\u2019re going to have work visas for the farm workers. If you look, you know we have a lot of people coming through the border, they\u2019re great people and they work on the farms and then they go back home. We like those people a lot and we want them to continue to come in.\n\nAnother part of your overall plan, the tax reform plan. Is it OK if that tax plan increases the deficit? Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax reform didn\u2019t.\n\nWell, it actually did. But, but it\u2019s called priming the pump. You know, if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re never going to bring your taxes down. Now, if we get the health-care [bill through Congress], this is why, you know a lot of people said, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he going with taxes first, that\u2019s his wheelhouse?\u201d Well, hey look, I convinced many people over the last two weeks, believe me, many Congressmen, to go with it. And they\u2019re great people, but one of the great things about getting health care is that we will be saving, I mean anywhere from $400bn to $900bn.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: That all goes into tax reduction. Tremendous savings.\n\nBut beyond that it\u2019s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit?\n\nIt is OK, because it won\u2019t increase it for long. You may have two years where you\u2019ll\u2026you understand the expression \u201cprime the pump\u201d?\n\nYes.\n\nWe have to prime the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s very Keynesian.\n\nWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event?\n\nPriming the pump?\n\nYeah, have you heard it?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you heard that expression used before? Because I haven\u2019t heard it. I mean, I just\u2026I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It\u2019s what you have to do.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026\n\nYeah, what you have to do is you have to put something in before you can get something out.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And as we talked about, economic growth under the Trump administration could increase revenues as much as $2trn over the ten-year period of time. So priming the pump in the short term leads to growth.\n\nSo you would have a bigger deficit, a stimulus, to prime the pump that would lead to faster growth?\n\nSo I happen to think that 3% is low. But you can\u2019t do it if your companies are leaving the country because taxes are too high. Now, I\u2019m going to do something there too. If our companies leave the country, number one they\u2019re leaving for numerous reasons but one of the big reasons is the taxes are so high. When they leave\u2014go back to trade for a second, when they leave the country, go to a certain country wherever it may be, and they fire all their workers in the United States and on the assumption they build cars or air conditioners or whatever they\u2019re building, and they open a plant someplace else and then they send the air conditioner or the car into our country with no tax, that\u2019s not going to happen anymore. They\u2019re going to have a very large tax to pay, in the vicinity of 35%.\n\nNow when you do that, number one they're not leaving the country anyway. So we\u2019re not leaving. I don\u2019t know if you saw what\u2019s happening. Ford has announced massive expansions in the United States. General Motors cancelled a big plant in Mexico and a big plant in Europe. They\u2019re all cancelling plans because I told them, I said\u2026I get along with them great. But I said, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t mind if you leave the country. You can build all you want out of country, I hope you enjoy your plant. But when you build your car, you\u2019re going to have a 35% tax when you bring it back in. And if your numbers work, we wish you well. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have. You\u2019re going to have a 35% tax.\u201d\n\nSo I mean, I have, it has, I haven\u2019t been given massive credit for it yet, but I have been given some because I just see polls out in Michigan and different places, that really are affected by this, have been unbelievable, you know, much bigger than election day. But that\u2019s not a tax increase, that\u2019s no tax. In other words, all you have to do is don\u2019t leave and you won\u2019t have a\u2026but we\u2019re bringing our taxes down so low that you won\u2019t even need the barrier because the taxes are so low, that people are going to stay.\n\nThe other thing, just in case we\u2026I believe it could be anywhere from $4trn to $5trn outside, you know don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve been talking about $2.5trn for four years now. I\u2019ve been using $2.5trn, the same number we\u2019ve all been using for years. Well, you know, it grows. I think it\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was $5trn but, you know, we\u2019re close. We\u2019re letting that money come back in. And that has two barriers which you have to watch. It\u2019s got a barrier of the tax, which we will take care of. We\u2019re going to make it 10%. Now it\u2019s 35%...\n\nSorry, 10%? The repatriation taxes?\n\nThe repatriation. Inversion. The corporate inversions, which is a disaster, with the companies leaving. But they want to bring back their money. Number one, the tax is too high but the other thing that\u2019s too high is the bureaucracy.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Correct.\n\nPresident Trump: I have a friend who said even if you wanted to bring it back in you can\u2019t because you have to go through so many papers, so many documents, so many\u2026\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re going to make it simple\n\nPresident Trump: You have to do\u2026Steve, they told me you\u2019ve got to sign books and books of stuff, you pay millions of dollars in legal fees and they almost don\u2019t allow you to bring it back in.\n\nCan I ask you a question about the politics of tax?\n\nIt should be like one page.\n\nThe politics of this? Do you need to get Democratic support to get this tax plan passed?\n\nUm. Little bit.\n\nAnd to get Democratic support, they prefer\u2026\n\nDepending. It depends on which plan, you know, which concept we\u2019ve got to\u2026but it could be. But I think the Democrats are going to like it. We may align it with infrastructure, which they like. They like it as much as the Republicans like it. We need infrastructure in our country. This country has wasted $6trn in the Middle East. Wasted. Like taking it and throwing it right out that window. Right in to the Rose Garden. See that beautiful Rose Garden? Look at those very nicely dressed people. It\u2019s religious liberty out there. [NB. Immediately after this interview, President Trump was due to sign an executive order promoting religious liberty.]\n\nMr President, can I just try you on a deal-making question? If you do need Democratic support for your tax plan, your ideal tax plan, and the price of that the Democrats say is for you to release your tax returns, would you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a very interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they\u2019re not going to\u2026nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I\u2019ll release them. Maybe I\u2019ll release them after I\u2019m finished because I\u2019m very proud of them actually. I did a good job.\n\nHope Hicks [White House director of strategic communication]: Once the audit is over.\n\nPresident Trump: I might release them after I\u2019m out of office.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Just so you know, I\u2019ve already started meeting with Democratic senators and, you know, the support has been pretty interesting. I mean, I think a lot of the Democratic senators actually believe we\u2019re on to the right tax plan to bring back business to America, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re all about, they want to grow jobs in their states, just like the president does.\n\nMs Hicks: And our plan has things like child-care tax credits which have never been presented before\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: By the way, so as you know I\u2019m under routine audit, so they\u2019re not going to be done. But you know, at a certain point, that\u2019s something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.\n\nRight, got that.\n\nI would never do it. That would be\u2026I think that would be unfair to the deal. It would be disrespectful of the importance of this deal. Because the only people that find that important are the reporters.\n\nWell, the Democrats say it\u2019s important.\n\nWell, don't forget I got elected without it. Somebody said, \u201cOh but you have to do it,\u201d I said, \u201cLook where I am\u201d. I was, you know, I was out front, I was asked that question, every debate, I said, you know, I\u2019m under routine audit.\n\nMr Mnuchin: And the president\u2019s financial disclosure has been longer than any\u2026\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: Plus my financial disclosure is 104 pages.\n\nMs Hicks: I think when people say that that makes it about the president and the politics versus the people, which is what we\u2019re focused on.\n\nPresident Trump: Right.\n\nCan I ask you about the focus of the tax cut because you\u2019ve spoken about a massive tax cut for ordinary workers\u2026\n\nRight, this would be the biggest tax cut in the history of the country.\n\nBut the biggest winners from this tax cut, right now, look as though they will be the very wealthiest Americans.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t believe that. Because they\u2019re losing all of their deductions, I can tell you.\n\nBut something like eliminating the estate tax.\n\nI get more deductions, I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions, they have deductions for birds flying across America, they have deductions for everything. There are more deductions\u2026now you\u2019re going to get an interest deduction, and a charitable deduction. But we\u2019re not going to have all this nonsense that they have right now that complicates things and makes it\u2026you know when we put out that one page, I said, we should really put out a, you know, a big thing, and then I looked at the one page, honestly it\u2019s pretty well covered. Hard to believe.\n\nWill you keep interest deduction in the corporate tax? Will corporate interest payments\u2026\n\nDo you want to answer?\n\nMr Mnuchin: We\u2019re contemplating it. We\u2019re contemplating it.\n\nContemplating getting rid of it?\n\nMr Mnuchin: No, we\u2019re contemplating keeping it. That\u2019s our preference. But we\u2019ll look at everything.\n\nSo what would your preference be Mr President? You know about that very well.\n\nNo, I would say probably\u2026I think we\u2019re contemplating is the word. And it hasn\u2019t been determined yet, but we\u2019re contemplating.\n\nContemplating\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re contemplating various\u2026I have to say, we\u2019re contemplating various things, but one of the things that\u2019s very important is simplicity. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Because even if you do, it\u2019s complicated. I mean even if you keep it simple with taxes it gets complicated.\n\nAnd are you contemplating things outside of corporate income tax? For example a VAT, which many countries have?\n\nWell, you know, a lot of people consider the border tax a form of VAT.\n\nAre you still\u2026\n\nPart of the problem with NAFTA is that Mexico\u2019s a VAT. So Mexico is paying almost\u2026we pay 17%. So we are now down 17%, going into Mexico when we trade. So that\u2019s like, you have a football team and every time they play a game, they\u2019re down, you know, 25 points. How can you possibly do good?\n\nBut would you consider\u2026\n\nYou could actually make the case, that the 17 is doubled. You can make that case. You know, it\u2019s 17 and it\u2019s really 17 and it\u2019s a double.\n\nMr Mnuchin: Right\n\nWould you consider a VAT for the United States?\n\nWell the concept of VAT I really like. But let me give you the bad news. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country because we\u2019re used to an income tax, we\u2019re used to a\u2026people are used to this tax, whether they like it or don't like, they\u2019re used to this tax. I fully understand because I have a lot of property in the UK. And it\u2019s, sort of, not a bad tax. And every time I pay it, they end up sending it back to me. In fact, my accountant is always saying\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s a good tax.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really not so bad. Like, I own Turnberry in Scotland. And every time I pay they say, \u201cYes sir, you pay it now but you get it back next year.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat kind of tax is this, I like this tax.\u201d But the VAT is\u2026I like it, I like it a lot, in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t mean because of, you know, getting it back, you don\u2019t get all of it back, but you get a lot of it back. But I like a VAT. I don\u2019t think it can be sold in this country, I think it\u2019s too much of a shock to this system. I can tell you if we had a VAT it would make dealing with Mexico very much easier. Because it could neutralise. And I really mean that. Part of the problem with NAFTA, the day they signed it, it was a defective deal. Because Mexico has almost a 17% VAT tax and it\u2019s very much of a hidden tax, people don\u2019t see it. So, but these guys, instead of renegotiating the following week\u2026many years ago, how old is that? 35?\n\nMr Mnuchin: 35 years ago.\n\nPresident Trump: But instead of negotiating, we suffered with this for, you know, for decades.\n\nBut as you said Mr President, a border-adjustment tax has some similarities to that. Are you still considering a border-adjustment tax?\n\nWe are dealing with Congress\u2026because it\u2019s not really what I\u2019m considering. I mean look, on health care, I think we have a great bill and there\u2019s still a little bit further to go because we\u2019re also dealing with the Senate, but the Senate I believe really wants to get something done because Obamacare is dead, just so we understand. Obamacare is absolutely dead. The insurance companies are leaving. Yesterday Aetna just announced they\u2019re pulling out. You have states that aren\u2019t going to have any insurance companies. You know when people say, \u201cOh, Obamacare is so wonderful,\u201d there is no Obamacare, it\u2019s dead. Plus we\u2019re subsidising it and we don\u2019t have to subsidise it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will.\n\nYou\u2019d pull the plug on that? If this bill doesn\u2019t go through you\u2019d stop those subsidies?\n\nNo, this bill only gives them one month. They don\u2019t realize that, that\u2019s another thing. Good point. This bill gives them one month, it gave, you know the subsidy\u2026\n\nThe continuation of the subsidy?\n\nThe subsidy to the insurance companies, yes. Anytime I want because actually\u2026\n\nBut my question is if the bill doesn\u2019t pass\u2026\n\nIn actuality Congress has to approve it. Congress\u2026\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass would you cut the subsidies?\n\nIf the bill doesn\u2019t pass, I\u2019d be in a different position. Because, if the bill didn\u2019t pass the Republicans would have let me down. And then I\u2019d have to decide what I want to do because I want people to have health care. Our health care is much better than Obamacare. It\u2019s going to be much less expensive. We\u2019re going to have competition, we\u2019re getting rid of the state lines, etc etc. The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low. If it didn\u2019t pass\u2026it\u2019s a great question, I don\u2019t want to think about that but the answer is\u2026I would do something to make sure the people have health care, as bad as Obamacare is.\n\nOne of the things that was so different about your campaign message compared to other Republicans was, you said things like \u201cI want everyone to be covered\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to let people die on the streets.\n\nBut some people will look at this bill and say, hang on, a lot of people are going to lose their coverage.\n\nOK. So we have a pool for people that are having difficulty. We have got a pool. It\u2019s a high-risk pool. And this pool we just funded yesterday, we\u2019re putting in $8bn, into the pool. So depending on what states do\u2026because I would like to see states taking over health care, I think they could do a better job than the federal government. Now in some cases that\u2019ll be great, like in Florida that works fantastically with Rick Scott, and a couple of others. And in some states it isn\u2019t, where they\u2019re not equipped to do it. But ultimately, you know I use the expression, \u201cIf you have a bad knee, I would rather have the federal government focus on North Korea than fixing your knee.\u201d\n\nThe state governments are in much better position to, you know, help people. In terms of, you know, just the size, the mere size of it. But we\u2019re putting in $8bn and you\u2019re going to have absolute coverage. You\u2019re going to have absolute guaranteed coverage. You\u2019re going to have it if you\u2019re a person going in\u2026don\u2019t forget, this was not supposed to be the way insurance works. Insurance is, you\u2019re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you\u2019re 70, and you really need it, you\u2019re still paying the same amount and that\u2019s really insurance.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s very important to have this. Because one thing Obamacare did, is it gave that and it was a concept that people hadn\u2019t heard of. And now I don't want to end it. I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that\u2026first of all I don\u2019t want to end it for the people that already have it. And I don\u2019t want to end it for somebody that hasn\u2019t been buying insurance for all of his life where he has a guarantee that for all of his life he\u2019s been buying the insurance and he can buy it inexpensively when he turns 65 or 70 years old. So we put in a tremendous amount and we\u2019re\u2026you know, for the pre-existing conditions. We are going to have a great pool for pre-existing conditions.\n\nNow, that will even get better as it\u2019s going along, it\u2019s going to get better. But in a way you could say, that\u2019s not really insurance, but it's there. And I want to make it as\u2026I want to make it actually better than what they have in Obama[care]. Now, Obama[care] has something that\u2019s very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realise, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don\u2019t get any benefit out of it. We don\u2019t have that. We\u2019re going to have much lower premiums and we\u2019re going to have much lower deductibles.\n\nBut when you used to say the hard right of the Republicans can\u2019t be trusted to look after people\u2026\n\nThey came through.\n\nThey came through? So do you still have to keep them in line.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you\u2026Did anybody ever hear of a guy named Mike Pence? Vice-president of the United States?\n\nMike Pence, the vice-president, enters the room: Morning all.\n\nPresident Trump: Central casting.\n\nMr Pence: Please sit, sit, sit.\n\nMs Hicks: We got about two more minutes. So just one more question.\n\nPresident Trump: So I know exactly the speeches you\u2019re talking about. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow people to die on the streets\u201d, and I said it over and over and I meant it more than anything and I probably mean it more now than even when I made the speech. We\u2019re talking about the high-risk pools, Mike, and we just added $8bn to the high-risk pools.\n\nMr Pence: Yes, sir.\n\nPresident Trump: People are going to have\u2026they\u2019re going to have great insurance. Now, we have one more step to go. You know we have to go through the Senate and we\u2019re refining it even further. But I will tell you, Mike, I just spoke to a few of the senators and they have some great ideas also and they want to get it there.\n\nSo, the problem with Obamacare? He rushed it through, he wanted\u2026although, when I say rushed it through, at the end. They were giving up everything, they were taking out everything. It wasn\u2019t a pure form of what they wanted anyway. They did the Nebraska trade where basically it was, you know, the whole thing was given away.\n\nLook, Obamacare was a disaster. Under Obamacare, you get your doctor; that was a lie. You get your plan; that was a lie. With us, you get your doctor. You get your plan. With us you\u2019ll get hundreds and hundreds of plans. You know, one of the insurance companies, one of the big ones came to see me yesterday. They\u2019re so anxious to start going crazy and you know it\u2019s going to be like life insurance. People that buy life insurance they\u2019re inundated with carriers. All different plans. That\u2019s what this is going to be like. And I said to them, \u201cWhat do you think the good plans are going to look like?\u201d He said, \u201cMr President, we\u2019re going to have so many plans. We\u2019re going to have the low version, the high version\u201d, he used the word Cadillac. I won\u2019t tell you what car he used for the low version because I don\u2019t want you to write it because they happen to be friends of mine, you know, the head people. [Goes off the record.]\n\nMr President, in business you keep score of your profits. How do you keep score in Trumponomics and in politics?\n\nWell I think the score is going to be the end of the game. To me the score is going to have to be at the end of the game. I was saying, Mike, that we\u2019re going to prime the pump with the taxes because we\u2019re going to take in perhaps a little bit less, but we\u2019re going to have a lot more business, we\u2019re going to have companies coming back into the country.\n\nI know a lot of companies that want to come back in but they\u2019re not going to come back in because of taxes. And we have a lot of companies that will come back into the country. They were forced out of the country because the taxes were too high. Many, many. You look at what\u2019s going on in certain countries. In fact I own a lot of property in certain countries where they were forced out.\n\nYou look at Ireland. I own great property in Ireland that I bought during their downturn. And I give the Irish a lot, a lot of credit. They never raised their taxes. You know you would have thought when they were going through that really\u2026they would\u2019ve double and tripled their taxes. They never raised it a penny. And they got through it and they are thriving now. Ireland\u2019s done an amazing job. A lot of companies have moved to Ireland and they like it.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to be getting a lot of companies moving back and we\u2019re going to get very few companies leaving the United States because we went from the highest tax rate of\u2026not only major, you know they always say major countries, just about the highest tax rate period. And then when you add all the other things. And then when you add the regulations to the tax\u2026I\u2019ve had people tell me, because I\u2019ve cut massive regulations and we\u2019ve just started, believe me. But we\u2019ve cut regulations massively.\n\nI\u2019ve had people tell me that the cutting of those regulations is more important to them than bringing it down from 35% to 15%. And if you would have told me that, if I had a guess one before I knew the answer, I would\u2019ve said, nobody would\u2019ve taken the regulations. 90% of the people would rather have the regulations cut. So when you talk about the tax cut, the regulation cut, Dodd-Frank, you\u2019ll be doing a story on that fairly soon because we\u2019re doing a very massive overhaul on Dodd-Frank. We\u2019re doing things that are going to keep people real happy.\n\nAnd then ultimately, when I leave office, on the assumption [Mike Pence] doesn\u2019t follow me, but he will. But when I leave office what happens is slowly they\u2019ll nip away at it, nip away, nip away and then in 40, 50 years somebody else will come along and bring it back. But we\u2019re bringing back entrepreneurship. We\u2019re bringing back enthusiasm. And if you look at the people that read your magazine, that are in this country, the enthusiasm levels, and you know this because you see it, are the highest they've even been. The enthusiasm levels for manufacturers went up 27 points in two months. If it goes up a quarter of point it\u2019s like a massive\u2026it went up 27% in two months, up to 93%, they\u2019ve never been even close. The enthusiasm for business is the highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nMs Hicks: And we\u2019ll have you guys back to talk about it. Sorry\n\nThank you so much, Mr President.\n\nI hope you had enough time.\n\nYou\u2019ve been very kind.", "images": ["http://www.economist.com/static/illustration/newsletter-signup.svg", "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200418_USP003_0.jpg", "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/05/articles/main/20170513_blp520.jpg", "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200418_USP501.jpg", "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200418_USP002_0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/05/articles/main/20170513_blp520.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Economist"], "canonical_link": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/05/11/transcript-interview-with-donald-trump", "title": "Q&A - Transcript: Interview with Donald Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "theme-color": "#E3120B", "msapplication-TileColor": "#E3120B", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/ico/tile-144.png", "application-name": "The Economist", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Economist", "description": "The Economist talks to the President of the United States about economic policy", "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "title": "Transcript: Interview with Donald Trump", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/05/11/transcript-interview-with-donald-trump", "description": "The Economist talks to the President of the United States about economic policy", "image": "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/05/articles/main/20170513_blp520.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheEconomist", "description": "The Economist talks to the President of the United States about economic policy", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/05/articles/main/20170513_blp520.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 193926687345108, "pages": "6013004059,1487031108050752"}, "next-head-count": 21}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.economist.com", "summary": ""}
