Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable.

Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28]\n\nIn elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records.\n\nIn elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F5DBQB7KVMZVTERC6M4ZQSWQHI.jpg&w=150", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=236"], "top_img": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=236", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Justin Levitt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/", "title": "A comprehensive investigation of voter impersonation finds 31 credible incidents out of one billion ballots cast", "meta_data": {"description": "Voter impersonation is a dumb way to steal an election, which is why it rarely happens.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/", "title": "A comprehensive investigation of voter impersonation finds 31 credible incidents out of one billion ballots cast", "description": "Voter impersonation is a dumb way to steal an election, which is why it rarely happens."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A comprehensive investigation of voter impersonation finds 31 credible incidents out of one billion ballots cast", "description": "Voter impersonation is a dumb way to steal an election, which is why it rarely happens."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-26T08:43:32.945Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1407254400.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
