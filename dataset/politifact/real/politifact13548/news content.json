{"url": "http://time.com/4523755/donald-trump-leaked-tape-impact/", "text": "The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post\u2019s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nBut not even John Podesta\u2019s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.\n\nRepublicans lined up to criticize Trump\u2019s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump\u2019s Sunday night\u2019s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.\n\nTrump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans\u2019 freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. \u201cThese words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,\u201d Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.\n\nThen, against allies\u2019 advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s marriage. \u201cBill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. \u201cDonald Trump needs to humble himself,\u201d Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump\u2019s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. \u201cThere have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,\u201d Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: \u201cHow does any woman work for Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nIt made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America\u2019s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department\u2019s release of more of Clinton\u2019s own emails from her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump\u2019s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s candidacy appeared\u2014yet again\u2014to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta\u2019s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton\u2019s emails, which he called an \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump\u2019s words, however. \u201cWomen have the power to stop Trump,\u201d Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.\n\nIn an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events\u2014and the responses\u2014would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it\u201d hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cHe is talking about sexual assault. There\u2019s no other way to frame this,\u201d Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.\n\nFor Clinton, her top aide\u2019s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches\u2014a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton\u2019s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn\u2019t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa\u2019s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? \u201cClinton admits she is out of touch,\u201d \u201cClinton suggests she is a moderate\u201d and \u201cClinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.\u201d\n\nAnother potential pickle is this headline: \u201cClinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.\u201d Republicans are obsessed with Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump\u2019s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.\n\nYet, as a whole, Trump\u2019s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call \u201clocker-room banter\u201d laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women\u2019s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: \u201cNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\u201d The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that \u201csuch vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\u2019s face to the world.\u201d Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump \u201ca malignant clown.\u201d Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks\u201dtotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said \u201cAmerica deserves far better\u201d than Trump. Trump\u2019s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said \u201cno apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women.\u201d\n\nTrump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump\u2019s video. \u201cThey did their opposition research. This is what they had,\u201d former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. \u201cShe has to change the narrative.\u201d Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump\u2019s supporters firmly in their camp. \u201cA 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,\u201d he said.\n\nThat thinking might help some of Trump\u2019s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman\u2019s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.\n\nBut there\u2019s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night\u2019s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.\n\nGet our Politics Newsletter.
