HAMMER (805) 499-8548\n\n\n\nClick here for chart\n\nCard industry advisor R.K. Hammer has released its year-end 2010 results for the credit industry penalty fees assessed during the past year. This is the fourth in the Hammer annual series of seven year-end reports, dealing with all aspects of credit card industry trends: risks, costs, and profits. Some of the report highlights are: Card penalty fees assessed during 2010 totaled $22.5 Billion in the latest Hammer model. This is down slightly from year-end 2009 of $22.9 Billion. Reasons for the decline include: fewer card accounts on the books due to recent portfolio purges, and delinquency figures improving through 2010. As you can see, other than 2010, penalty fees in the card business had been on an ever increasing annual climb: 2003: $10.7 B 2004: $11.7 B 2005: $14.8 B 2006: $17.1 B 2007: $18.1 B 2008: $19.0 B 2009: $22.9 B 2010: $22.5 B Company CEO Bob Hammer commented, \u201cIt is important to note that increased consumer costs due to raised APR\u2019s for delinquent accounts (often termed \u201cPenalty Pricing) are not included in the annual Hammer fee income model, as that interest charged is reported in the Interest Income category, not in \u201cNon-Interest\u201d (Fee) Income.\u201d \u201cAlso, as in the past our fee income model broadly includes interchange income, penalty fees, annual fees, cash advance fees/bal. transfer fees, and enhancement income. Penalty fee income is comprised of late fees, over limit fees and other miscellaneous fee income, the vast majority (90%+) are late fees.\u201d \u201cInterest income for decades has clearly been the largest revenue stream for cards, followed by fee income. Those lines have now almost intersected, and are expected to do so in the next 18 \u2013 24 months, with fee income then becoming the largest component of revenue for card issuers. Recent rule changes and regulation impacting interest cards may charge and how interest rate changes may be implemented have hastened issuers\u2019 direction and refocus toward new fees and repricing current fees.\u201d Hammer forecast for 2011: \u201cFee Income rising 9% for credit card companies.\u201d- Formed in 1990, R.K.
