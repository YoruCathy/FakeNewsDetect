But nearly one year later, more than three million more Americans have lost their jobs, the deficit is set to hit a record shattering $1.6 trillion, and Administration reports on how many jobs were \u201csaved or created\u201d have been \u201criddled with inaccuracies and contradictions,\u201d noted USA Today.\n\n\n\nBy the metrics the Democrats themselves set, the \u201cstimulus\u201d hasn\u2019t worked \u2013 it\u2019s chock-full of wasteful government spending that\u2019s funneled money to Congressional districts that don\u2019t exist and claims of jobs \u201csaved or created\u201d were so exaggerated that the Administration quietly abandoned the metric at the end of last year.\n\n\n\nPoll after poll confirms that an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the \u201cstimulus\u201d program. In fact, a CBS/New York Times poll released yesterday found that \u201c just 6 percent of Americans think it has created jobs .\u201d Any wonder that a CNN survey reported that \u201c3 of 4 Americans say much of stimulus money wasted.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo where is all the \u201cstimulus\u201d money going? Here are just a few real-world examples:\n\n\n\nreported last month that:\n\n\n\nAnd if that wasteful spending wasn\u2019t bad enough, the Associated Press reported last month that:\n\n\u201cA federal spending surge of more than $20 billion for roads and bridges in President Barack Obama\u2019s first stimulus has had no effect on local unemployment rates...An Associated Press analysis of stimulus spending found that it didn\u2019t matter if a lot of money was spent on highways or none at all: Local unemployment rates rose and fell regardless. And the stimulus spending only barely helped the beleaguered construction industry, the analysis showed....\n\n\n\n\u201cEven within the construction industry, which stood to benefit most from transportation money, the AP\u2019s analysis found there was nearly no connection between stimulus money and the number of construction workers hired or fired since Congress passed the recovery program. The effect was so small, one economist compared it to trying to move the Empire State Building by pushing against it.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/img/image03.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/img/image06.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/img/image07.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/UploadedFiles/1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/UploadedFiles/bulb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/images/transpix.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/img/image05.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/UploadedFiles/2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100215141959im_/http://republicanleader.house.gov/img/image03.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "As Dems\u2019 \u201cStimulus\u201d Anniversary Nears, Americans Ask: \u201cWhere are the Jobs?\u201d", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
