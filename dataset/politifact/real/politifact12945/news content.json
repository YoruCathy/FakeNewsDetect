DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15\u201330 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you\u2019ve ever really known.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who\u2019ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.\n\nI\u2019m sure this election has been stressful for you.\n\nIt can\u2019t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation\u2019s problems. That\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not kind, and it\u2019s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.\n\nMany of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You\u2019ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn\u2019t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.\n\nI want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential \u2014 that\u2019s what makes our country great, and that\u2019s the promise I\u2019m going to fight to fulfill.\n\nSo here\u2019s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you\u2019ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country \u2014 and that\u2019s what DACA can provide.\n\nBut I know that\u2019s not enough \u2014 we have to do more for you and your families. That\u2019s why as president, I\u2019m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.\n\nWhile we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court\u2019s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president\u2019s authority and won\u2019t stop fighting until we see it through.\n\nSo today, let\u2019s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it\u2019s helped so far \u2014 and let\u2019s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.\n\nWe have always been a nation of immigrants \u2014 those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won\u2019t forget it, and I won\u2019t forget you.\n\nThank you \u2014 and keep being brave,\n\nHillary", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*jwy21sK7cNCsZfbFIZfgMg.png", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*D8kWZdDVO7h1CIvB5bVquA.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*D8kWZdDVO7h1CIvB5bVquA.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*NUJaCJ86BMdYeTlKnbTfWQ.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/84/1*LMABCvdItK4dVSsfVyUORQ.png", "https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*NUJaCJ86BMdYeTlKnbTfWQ.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NUJaCJ86BMdYeTlKnbTfWQ.jpeg?q=20"], "top_img": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*NUJaCJ86BMdYeTlKnbTfWQ.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hillary Clinton"], "canonical_link": "https://medium.com/hillary-for-america/to-young-people-who-are-undocumented-this-is-your-country-too-e0184e858b40", "title": "To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}, "url": {"iphone": "medium://p/e0184e858b40"}}, "title": "To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.", "site": "@Medium", "description": "Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action\u2026", "image": {"src": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*NUJaCJ86BMdYeTlKnbTfWQ.jpeg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Reading time", "data1": "5 min read"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236, "url": "medium://p/e0184e858b40"}, "android": {"package": "com.medium.reader", "url": "medium://p/e0184e858b40", "app_name": "Medium"}, "web": {"url": "https://medium.com/hillary-for-america/to-young-people-who-are-undocumented-this-is-your-country-too-e0184e858b40"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "pages": 889307941125736}, "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "type": "article", "title": "To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.", "description": "Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action\u2026", "url": "https://medium.com/hillary-for-america/to-young-people-who-are-undocumented-this-is-your-country-too-e0184e858b40", "image": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*NUJaCJ86BMdYeTlKnbTfWQ.jpeg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-08-15T20:07:15.488Z", "author": "https://medium.com/@HillaryClinton"}, "title": "To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.", "description": "Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.
