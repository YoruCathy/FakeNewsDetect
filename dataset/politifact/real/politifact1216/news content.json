The fact is, his plan contains huge new taxes that will harm the economy and cost more jobs. Democrats are paying for their dangerous experiment with higher taxes on small business owners, charitable giving, and even middle-class families who can least afford it. I encourage President Obama to abandon these health care taxes and set a course for a truly bipartisan bill that embraces reforms Americans actually want and need.\u201d \u2013 RNC Chairman Michael Steele\n\n\u201cDICTIONARY\u201d SCRIPT\n\nTime: 1:39\n\nVoice: \u201cBarack Obama and Democrats promise that healthcare reform will lower costs.\u201d\n\nVoice: \u201cBut their plans deliver increased taxes.\u201d\n\nChyron: THEIR PLANS DELIVER INCREASED TAXES\n\nChyron: TAXES ON\n\nVoice: \u201cTaxes on tests, scans and x-rays.\u201d\n\nChyron: NEW TAXES ON\n\nVoice: \u201cNew taxes on charities and small businesses.\u201d\n\nChyron: CHARITIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES\n\nVoice: \u201cA doctor\u2019s tax.\u201d\n\nChyron: A DOCTOR\u2019S TAX\n\nVoice: \u201cTaxes on your health insurance.\u201d\n\nChyron: TAXES ON YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nVoice: \u201cEven a tax on medical supplies.\u201d\n\nChyron: EVEN A TAX ON MEDICAL SUPPLIES\n\nVoice: \u201cHundreds of billions in new taxes.\u201d\n\nChyron: HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN NEW TAXES\n\nVoice: \u201cAll of it passed right back to the consumer.\u201d\n\nChyron: PASSED BACK TO YOU\n\nVoice: \u201cAnd if you think you can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nChyron: IF YOU THINK YOU CAN\u2019T AFFORD IT\n\nVoice: \u201cYou can\u2019t afford not to.\u201d\n\nChyron: YOU CAN\u2019T AFFORD NOT TO\n\nVoice: \u201cBecause they\u2019ve even proposed a tax for not having health insurance.\u201d\n\nChyron: A TAX FOR NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nVoice: \u201cWith at least 8 new taxes.\u201d\n\nChyron: WITH AT LEAST 8 NEW TAXES\n\nVoice: \u201cYour health insurance costs will skyrocket.\u201d\n\nChyron: YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS WILL SKYROCKET\n\nVoice: \u201cOf course it\u2019s easy to raise taxes when you live in denial about the very meaning of the word.\u201d\n\nChyron: WHEN YOU LIVE IN DENIAL ABOUT THE VERY MEANING OF THE WORD\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: \u201cUnder this mandate, the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don\u2019t.
