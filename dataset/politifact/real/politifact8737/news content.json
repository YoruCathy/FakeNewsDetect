(EDT) Media contact: (202) 691-5902 Tuesday, April 8, 2008 JOB OPENINGS AND LABOR TURNOVER: FEBRUARY 2008 On the last business day of February, there were 3.8 million job openings in the United States, and the job openings rate was 2.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today. The job openings, hires, and total separations rates were essentially unchanged in February. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires, and separations for the total nonfarm sector by industry and geographic region. Although the month-to-month changes in job openings, hires, and turnover data are often small, the trends over time are notable. The job openings rate remained essen- tially flat from August 2006 through September 2007 then began trending downward. The hires rate has had an overall downward trend since July 2006, and the separations rate has had an overall downward trend since November 2006. (See tables 1, 2, and 3.) Job Openings In February, the job openings rate remained at 2.7 percent. Job openings include only those jobs open on the last business day of the month. Over the month, the job openings rate rose in education and health services (to 3.9 percent) and fell in man- ufacturing (1.8 percent). Geographically, the job openings rate did not change signi- ficantly in any region. Since the series began in December 2000, three industries have consistently had higher job openings rates than the other industries: education and health services (3.9 percent in February), accommodation and food services (3.8 per- cent), and professional and business services (3.7 percent). (See table 1.) Over the year, the job openings rate did not rise significantly in any industry. The rate fell over the year for total nonfarm (to 2.6 percent) and total private (2.8 percent) as well as in several industries, including construction (1.8 percent); durable goods manufacturing (1.6 percent); nondurable goods manufacturing (2.1 per- cent); transportation, warehousing, and utilities (2.2 percent); information (1.7 per- cent); other services (2.1 percent); and federal government (1.1 percent). Region- ally, the job openings rate fell over the year in the Northeast (2.2 percent) and in the South (2.8 percent). (See table 5.) Hires The hires rate was unchanged at 3.4 percent in February. Hires are any additions to the payroll during the month. Over the month, the hires rate did not change signi- ficantly in any industry or region. As occurs nearly every month, the seasonally ad- justed hires rate was highest in February in accommodation and food services (6.1 per- cent) and lowest in state and local government (1.5 percent). (See table 2.) From February 2007 to February 2008, the hires rate rose in construction (to 4.3 percent); other services (3.0 percent); and in federal government (2.4 percent). Over the year, the hires rate fell in durable goods manufacturing (1.7 percent); non- durable goods manufacturing (2.3 percent); educational services (2.0 percent); and in the Midwest region (2.5 percent).

Separations are terminations of employment that occur at any time during the month. Over the month, the separations rate did not change significantly in any industry or region. As with hires, the seasonally adjusted separations rate was, as usual, highest in February in accommodation and food services (6.1 percent) and low- est in state and local government (1.2 percent). From February 2007 to February 2008, the total separations rate rose in healthcare and social assistance (2.3 percent); the rate fell over the year in durable goods manufacturing (1.9 percent) and in the Midwest region (2.4 percent). (See tables 3 and 7.) Total separations include quits (voluntary separations), layoffs and discharges (in- voluntary separations), and other separations (including retirements). The quits rate, which can serve as a barometer of workers\u2019 ability to change jobs, was unchanged in February for total nonfarm (1.8 percent) but rose in the professional and business ser- vices industry (to 2.7 percent) and in the Northeast region (1.6 percent) and fell in retail trade (to 2.4 percent). As has occurred every month since the series began in December 2000, the seasonally adjusted quits rate was highest in the accommodation and food services industry (4.3 percent) and lowest in state and local government (0.6 per- cent). (See table 4.) From February 2007 to February 2008, the quits rate did not change significantly in any industry. Geographically, the quits rate rose in the Northeast (to 1.2 percent) and fell in the Midwest (to 1.3 percent). (See table 8.) The other two components of total separations--layoffs and discharges, and other se- parations--are not seasonally adjusted. For February, the layoffs and discharges rate (1.0 percent) and level (1.4 million) were essentially unchanged from a year earlier. The layoffs and discharges rate in February 2008 was highest in arts, entertainment, and recreation (2.5 percent) and lowest in state and local government (0.1 percent). The other separations rate (0.2 percent) and level (281,000) were little changed in February from a year ago. The highest other separations rate in February was in federal government (0.6 percent). The other separations rate is 0.2 percent or lower in most industries each month. (See tables 9 and 10.) The total separations rate is driven by the relative contribution of its three compon- ents (quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations), with quits contributing the largest portion. The percentage of total separations attributable to quits has risen and fallen over time along with total nonfarm employment levels. The proportion of total se- parations due to quits rose from a post-recession low of 50 percent in December 2003 to a high of 61 percent in December 2006 (seasonally adjusted) before trending downward again. In February 2008, quits accounted for 56 percent of total separations. The proportion of separations attributable to quits varies widely by industry with the highest proportion re- gularly occurring in the accommodation and food services industry (70 percent in February) and the lowest proportion regularly occurring in the construction industry (43 percent in February). (See tables 3 and 4.) - 4 - Flows in the Labor Market Several industries consistently have high rates of both hires and separations. These include construction; retail trade; professional and business services; arts, entertain- ment, and recreation; and accommodation and food services. In the 12 months ending in February 2008, these 5 industries produced 33.1 million hires and 31.8 million separations. Thus, these five industries accounted for 58 percent of total nonfarm hires and 58 percent of total nonfarm separations while comprising only 40 percent of total nonfarm employment.

Collection Each month, data are collected in a survey of business establishments for total employment, job openings, hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Data collection methods include computer-assisted telephone interviewing, touchtone data entry, fax, and mail. Coverage The JOLTS program covers all private nonfarm establishments such as factories, offices, and stores, as well as federal, state, and local government entities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Concepts Industry classification. The industry classifications in this release are in accordance with the 2007 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). In order to ensure the highest possible quality of data, State Workforce Agencies verify with employers and up- date, if necessary, the industry code, location, and ownership classi- fication of all establishments on a 3-year cycle. Changes in establish- ment characteristics resulting from the verification process are always introduced into the JOLTS sampling frame with the data reported for the first month of the year. Employment. Employment includes persons on the payroll who worked or received pay for the pay period that includes the 12th day of the refer- ence month. Full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, seasonal, sala- ried, and hourly employees are included, as are employees on paid vaca- tions or other paid leave. Proprietors or partners of unincorporated businesses, unpaid family workers, or persons on leave without pay or on strike for the entire pay period, are not counted as employed. Employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contrac- tors, and consultants are counted by their employer of record, not by the establishment where they are working. Job openings. Establishments submit job openings information for the last business day of the reference month. A job opening requires that: 1) a specific position exists and there is work available for that posi- tion, 2) work could start within 30 days regardless of whether a suitable candidate is found, and 3) the employer is actively recruiting from out- side the establishment to fill the position. Included are full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, and seasonal openings. Active re- cruiting means that the establishment is taking steps to fill a position by advertising in newspapers or on the Internet, posting help-wanted signs, accepting applications, or using other similar methods. Jobs to be filled only by internal transfers, promotions, demotions, or recall from layoffs are excluded. Also excluded are jobs with start dates more than 30 days in the future, jobs for which employees have been hired but have not yet reported for work, and jobs to be filled by employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, out- side contractors, or consultants. The job openings rate is computed by dividing the number of job openings by the sum of employment and job openings and multiplying that quotient by 100. - 6 - Hires. Hires are the total number of additions to the payroll occur- ring at any time during the reference month, including both new and rehired employees, full-time and part-time, permanent, short-term and seasonal employees, employees recalled to the location after a layoff lasting more than 7 days, on-call or intermittent employees who returned to work after having been formally separated, and transfers from other locations. The hires count does not include transfers or promotions within the reporting site, employees returning from strike, employees of temporary help agencies or employee leasing companies, outside contrac- tors, or consultants. The hires rate is computed by dividing the number of hires by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. Separations. Separations are the total number of terminations of employment occurring at any time during the reference month, and are reported by type of separation--quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Quits are voluntary separations by employees (ex- cept for retirements, which are reported as other separations). Lay- offs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the em- ployer and include layoffs with no intent to rehire, formal layoffs lasting or expected to last more than 7 days, discharges resulting from mergers, downsizing, or closings, firings or other discharges for cause, terminations of permanent or short-term employees, and terminations of seasonal employees. Other separations include re- tirements, transfers to other locations, deaths, and separations due to disability. Separations do not include transfers within the same location or employees on strike. The separations rate is computed by dividing the number of separa- tions by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. The quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations rates are computed simi- larly, dividing the number by employment and multiplying by 100. Annual estimates. Annual estimates of rates and levels of hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are released with the January news release each year. The JOLTS annual level estimates for hires, quits, layoffs and dis- charges, other separations, and total separations are the sum of the 12 published monthly levels. The annual rate estimates are computed by dividing the annual level by the Current Employment Statistics (CES) annual average employment level, and multiplying that quotient by 100. This figure will be approximately equal to the sum of the 12 monthly rates. Note that both the JOLTS and CES annual levels are rounded to the nearest thousand before the annual estimates are calculated. Con- sistent with BLS practices, annual estimates will be published only for not seasonally adjusted data. Annual estimates are not calculated for job openings because job openings are a stock, or point-in-time, measurement for the last busi- ness day of each month. Only jobs still open on the last day of the month are counted. For the same reason job openings cannot be cumulated throughout each month, annual figures for job openings cannot be created by summing the monthly estimates. Hires and separations are flow mea- sures and are cumulated over the month with a total reported for the month. Therefore, the annual figures can be created by summing the monthly estimates. - 7 - Sample methodology The JOLTS sample design is a random sample of 16,000 nonfarm business establishments, including factories, offices, and stores, as well as federal, state, and local governments in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The establishments are drawn from a universe of over eight million establishments compiled as part of the operations of the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, or QCEW, program. This program includes all employers subject to state Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and federal agencies subject to Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE). The sampling frame is stratified by ownership, region, industry sector, and size class. Large firms fall into the sample with virtual certainty. JOLTS total employment estimates are controlled to the employment esti- mates of the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey. A ratio of CES to JOLTS employment is used to adjust the levels for all other JOLTS data elements. Rates are then computed from the adjusted levels. Using JOLTS data The JOLTS data series on job openings, hires, and separations are rel- atively new. The full sample is divided into panels, with one panel en- rolled each month. A full complement of panels for the original data series based on the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system was not completely enrolled in the survey until January 2002. The sup- plemental panels of establishments needed to create NAICS estimates were not completely enrolled until May 2003. The data collected up until those points are from less than a full sample. Therefore, estimates from earlier months should be used with caution, as fewer sampled units were reporting data at that time. In March 2002, BLS procedures for collecting hires and separations data were revised to address possible underreporting. As a result, JOLTS hires and separations estimates for months prior to March 2002 may not be compar- able with estimates for March 2002 and later. The federal government reorganization that involved transferring approx- imately 180,000 employees to the new Department of Homeland Security is not reflected in the JOLTS hires and separations estimates for the federal gov- ernment. The Office of Personnel Management's record shows these transfers were completed in March 2003. The inclusion of transfers in the JOLTS defi- nitions of hires and separations is intended to cover ongoing movements of workers between establishments. The Department of Homeland Security reor- ganization was a massive one-time event, and the inclusion of these inter- governmental transfers would distort the federal government time series. Seasonal adjustment BLS seasonally adjusts several JOLTS series using the X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment program. Seasonal adjustment is the process of estimating and removing periodic fluctuations caused by events such as weather, holidays, and the beginning and ending of the school year. Seasonal adjustment makes it easier to observe fundamental changes in the level of the series, par- ticularly those associated with general economic expansions and contrac- tions. A concurrent seasonal adjustment methodology is used in which new seasonal adjustment factors are calculated each month, using all relevant data, up to and including the data for the current month. - 8 - Prior to the January 2007 benchmark release in March 2007, seasonal adjust- ment of the JOLTS series was conducted using the stable seasonal filter option since there were not enough data observations available for the standard use of moving averages as seasonal filters. Although the seasonal adjustment of the JOLTS series is conducted with fewer data observations than is customary, the number of observations is now above the minimum required by X-12-ARIMA to use the normal seasonal filters. Therefore, the standard use of moving aver- ages as seasonal filter is now in place for JOLTS seasonal adjustment. JOLTS seasonal adjustment now includes both additive and multiplicative seasonal adjustment models and REGARIMA (regression with autocorrelated errors) modeling to improve the seasonal adjustment factors at the beginning and end of the series and to detect and adjust for outliers in the series. Reliability of the estimates JOLTS estimates are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the \"true\" population values they represent. The exact difference, or sampling error, varies depending on the particular sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. BLS analysis is generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. That means that there is a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the \"true\" population value because of sampling error. Estimates of sampling errors are available upon request. The JOLTS estimates also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to include a seg- ment of the population, the inability to obtain data from all units in the sample, the inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide data on a timely basis, mistakes made by respondents, errors made in the collection or processing of the data, and errors from the employment benchmark data used in estimation. JOLTS hires and separations estimates cannot be used to exactly explain net changes in nonfarm payroll employment. Some reasons why it is problematic to compare changes in payroll employment with JOLTS hires and separations, espe- cially on a monthly basis, are: 1) the reference period for payroll employment is the pay period including the 12th of the month, while the reference period for hires and separations is the calendar month; and 2) payroll employment can vary from month to month simply because part-time and on-call workers may not always work during the pay period that includes the 12th of the month. Addi- tionally, research has found that some reporters systematically underreport separations relative to hires due to a number of factors, including the nature of their payroll systems and practices. The shortfall appears to be about 2 percent or less over a 12-month period. Other information Information in this release will be made available to sensory impaired individuals upon request.
