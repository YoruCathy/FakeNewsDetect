Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work \u2014 but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump \u2014 in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered \u2014 but deflation, not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, there\u2019s fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief.\n\nWho are these creditors I\u2019m talking about? Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that it\u2019s all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.\n\nNo, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.\n\nAnd that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, it\u2019s the class that has personal access to policy makers \u2014 many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesn\u2019t have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that what\u2019s good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings \u2014 hey, they\u2019re rich, they\u2019re smart, and they have great tailors \u2014 must be good for the economy as a whole.\n\nBut the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else. And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2011-06-10T00:53:28.000Z", "modified": "2011-06-10T02:02:28.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Banking and Financial Institutions", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 1248069767691, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/8e6fdc62-3b85-5ca8-9def-1013af67476e", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/10b21616c757489db4dc74ec850a9cc0", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "byl": "By Paul Krugman", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbStandard.png", "news_keywords": "Debt,US,Economy,Europe,US Economy,Banking and Finance", "pdate": 20110609, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/8e6fdc62-3b85-5ca8-9def-1013af67476e"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "CN": "paul-krugman", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/8e6fdc62-3b85-5ca8-9def-1013af67476e", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1307635200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
