The fact is, the United States economy has been stuck in a rut for a year and a half.\n\nYet a destructive passivity has overtaken our discourse. Turn on your TV and you\u2019ll see some self-satisfied pundit declaring that nothing much can be done about the economy\u2019s short-run problems (reminder: this \u201cshort run\u201d is now in its fourth year), that we should focus on the long run instead.\n\nThis gets things exactly wrong. The truth is that creating jobs in a depressed economy is something government could and should be doing. Yes, there are huge political obstacles to action \u2014 notably, the fact that the House is controlled by a party that benefits from the economy\u2019s weakness. But political gridlock should not be conflated with economic reality.\n\nOur failure to create jobs is a choice, not a necessity \u2014 a choice rationalized by an ever-shifting set of excuses.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | No, We Can\u2019t?
