Immediately thereafter, as always happens when Democrats take a stand, the civility police came out in force. The president, we were told, was being too partisan; he needs to treat his opponents with respect; he should have lunch with them, and work out a consensus.\n\nThat\u2019s a bad idea. Equally important, it\u2019s an undemocratic idea.\n\nLet\u2019s review the story so far.\n\nTwo weeks ago, House Republicans released their big budget proposal, selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity, not ideology \u2014 a document telling America What Must Be Done.\n\nBut it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document, which you might have guessed from the opening sentence: \u201cWhere the president has failed, House Republicans will lead.\u201d It hyped the danger of deficits, yet even on its own (not at all credible) accounting, spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction. The transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes, especially on the wealthy.\n\nSo the House budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two parties\u2019 priorities. And it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | Let\u2019s Not Be Civil", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2011-04-18T00:45:30.000Z", "modified": "2011-04-18T01:48:26.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Heritage Foundation", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 1248069714228, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/16f87119-7323-57ff-874c-54bf968aef1a", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/a144349489d748c39f87412e9a42b1af", "description": "The House budget proposal shows a huge gap between the two parties\u2019 priorities, and the difference should be made clear to voters.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "byl": "By Paul Krugman", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbStandard.png", "news_keywords": "Democrats,US Politics,Tax,House of Representatives,Congress,Federal Budget,Barack Obama,Republicans,Heritage Foundation", "pdate": 20110417, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Let\u2019s Not Be Civil", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png", "description": "The House budget proposal shows a huge gap between the two parties\u2019 priorities, and the difference should be made clear to voters."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | Let\u2019s Not Be Civil", "description": "The House budget proposal shows a huge gap between the two parties\u2019 priorities, and the difference should be made clear to voters.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/16f87119-7323-57ff-874c-54bf968aef1a"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "CN": "paul-krugman", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/16f87119-7323-57ff-874c-54bf968aef1a", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/opinion/18krugman.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1303056000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
