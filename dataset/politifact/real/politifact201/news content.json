You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.\"\n\nThe politics of immigration is different in New York. Immigration and burden are two words that do not appear often -- or without raising a furor -- in the same sentence. Whatever their legal status, immigrants are considered a fact of life, a point of pride and an integral part of New York City's identity. Many New Yorkers know well that their own forebears arrived without papers.\n\n\"So many of the Irish, so many of the Italians who came when my parents came, were technically illegal,\" Mr. Cuomo said.\n\nBecause of New York City's size, new immigrants are absorbed without as much fuss as elsewhere. Often, they are responsible for revitalizing dying neighborhoods -- like Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens -- and New Yorkers know it.\n\nIllegal immigrants in New York City confound the national stereotype of a young Mexican man sneaking across the border. Italians are the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans, Poles, Dominicans and Trinidadians. European, Caribbean, Latin American and Asian, they blend into the city without radically altering its racial and ethnic makeup. So the racism that often compounds anti-immigrant sentiment is not as stark in New York.", "images": ["https://s1.nyt.com/timesmachine/pages/1/1994/06/10/352888_360W.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deborah Sontag"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "title": "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "1994-06-10T05:00:00.000Z", "modified": "1994-06-10T05:00:00.000Z", "section": "New York", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/deborah-sontag", "tag": "IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 1994061000000352888, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/fbeaaa16-8d10-5ba3-904f-8945c6d1a077", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/f208dda6ff394798b93bfa09a7401df4", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Deborah Sontag", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "New York,NYC,Mario Cuomo,Rudolph W Giuliani,,", "pdate": 19940610, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "type": "article", "title": "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "title": "New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/fbeaaa16-8d10-5ba3-904f-8945c6d1a077"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "nyregion", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/fbeaaa16-8d10-5ba3-904f-8945c6d1a077", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/nyregion/new-york-officials-welcome-immigrants-legal-or-illegal.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://query.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
