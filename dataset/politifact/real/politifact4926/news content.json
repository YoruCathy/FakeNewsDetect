Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility.\n\nAs he said in 2007, \u201cIt\u2019s not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.\u201d\n\nLook at American history, Gingrich continued, \u201cThe government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.\u201d\n\nThis was not one of Gingrich\u2019s passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, \u201cWindow of Opportunity,\u201d is a broadside against what he calls the \u201claissez-faire\u201d conservatism \u2014 the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, \u201cThe opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-facebookJumbo-v2.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-thumbLarge-v2.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Brooks_New/Brooks_New-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-facebookJumbo-v2.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Brooks"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/brooks-the-gingrich-tragedy.html", "title": "Opinion | The Gingrich Tragedy", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2011-12-09T02:32:41.000Z", "modified": "2011-12-09T22:05:28.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Romney, Mitt", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000001215776, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/85a1f216-39ad-54b2-bb88-0721ee9fa10b", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/176c2607c4ba494aac05299ab3f1ea9b", "description": "Newt Gingrich may be big-government conservatism\u2019s leading messenger, but his temperament and character distort the effect.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-facebookJumbo-v2.png", "byl": "By David Brooks", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-thumbStandard-v2.png", "news_keywords": "Newt Gingrich,Republicans,2012 Presidential Election,Conservatism in the United States,Mitt Romney", "pdate": 20111208, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/brooks-the-gingrich-tragedy.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | The Gingrich Tragedy", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-facebookJumbo-v2.png", "description": "Newt Gingrich may be big-government conservatism\u2019s leading messenger, but his temperament and character distort the effect."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/brooks-the-gingrich-tragedy.html", "title": "Opinion | The Gingrich Tragedy", "description": "Newt Gingrich may be big-government conservatism\u2019s leading messenger, but his temperament and character distort the effect.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/david-brooks/david-brooks-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/85a1f216-39ad-54b2-bb88-0721ee9fa10b"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "CN": "david-brooks", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/brooks-the-gingrich-tragedy.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/85a1f216-39ad-54b2-bb88-0721ee9fa10b", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/brooks-the-gingrich-tragedy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/opinion/brooks-the-gingrich-tragedy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1323360000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
