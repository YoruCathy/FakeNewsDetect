Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge.\n\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.\n\nWorking together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobody\u2019s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.\n\nThe summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators\u2019 Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following:\n\nWhat standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates.\n\nHow to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty.\n\nHow to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical.\n\nHow to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage.\n\nHow to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns.\n\nHow to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability.\n\nOf course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation.\n\nNevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please don\u2019t let this opportunity pass us by.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Senator Barack Obama", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20070613045339im_/http://obama.senate.gov/img/print.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20070613045339im_/http://obama.senate.gov/img/tables_form.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20070613045339im_/http://obama.senate.gov/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20070613045339im_/http://obama.senate.gov/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
