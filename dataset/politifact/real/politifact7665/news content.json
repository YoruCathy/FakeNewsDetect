But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them.\n\nOn Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms \u2014 a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count.\n\nSome of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents \u2014 who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them.\n\nI watch TV and read the papers like everyone else. We know what we\u2019re going to hear: vague platitudes like \u201ctough vote\u201d and \u201ccomplicated issue.\u201d I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress. I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither. These senators made their decision based on political fear and on cold calculations about the money of special interests like the National Rifle Association, which in the last election cycle spent around $25 million on contributions, lobbying and outside spending.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabrielle Giffords"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "title": "Opinion | A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2013-04-18T00:29:25.000Z", "modified": "2013-04-18T00:29:15.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000002178078, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/074a8f8e-983e-5f10-b253-73993232b7b3", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/c1694612c65249e29b2cfd35a55b73a4", "description": "How the N.R.A. crushed background checks.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Gabrielle Giffords", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "Gun Control,,Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting,Senate,Congress,NRA,US Politics", "pdate": 20130417, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "How the N.R.A. crushed background checks."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "title": "Opinion | A Senate in the Gun Lobby\u2019s Grip", "description": "How the N.R.A. crushed background checks.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/074a8f8e-983e-5f10-b253-73993232b7b3"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/074a8f8e-983e-5f10-b253-73993232b7b3", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1366214400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
