Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry we\u2019re running just a little bit behind, but I figured it\u2019s a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden.\n\nToday, members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.\n\nRight now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits \u2013- profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -\u2013 a subsidy that they\u2019ve enjoyed year after year for the last century.\n\nThink about that. It\u2019s like hitting the American people twice. You\u2019re already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if these companies can\u2019t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies\u2019 profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we\u2019re giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.\n\nNow, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. That\u2019s why under my administration, we\u2019ve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. We\u2019ve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. We\u2019ve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic.\n\nSo the fact is, we\u2019re producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and we\u2019re importing less of it as well. For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -\u2013 for the first time in over a decade.\n\nSo American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, I\u2019m not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, they\u2019ve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think it\u2019s curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies.\n\nInstead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that\u2019s never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings. That\u2019s the future. That\u2019s the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year. As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. That\u2019s not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.\n\nAnd keep in mind, we can\u2019t just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil but we only have 2 percent of the world\u2019s known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but we\u2019d still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. We\u2019d still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because it\u2019s a world market, the fact that we\u2019re doing more here in the United States doesn\u2019t necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies they\u2019re selling that oil on a worldwide market. They\u2019re not keeping it just for us. And that means that if there\u2019s rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up.\n\nThat\u2019s not the future that I want for America. I don\u2019t want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that there\u2019s some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether there\u2019s going to be enough supply. I don\u2019t want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world.\n\nI want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And that\u2019s why, as long as I\u2019m President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that we\u2019re going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America.\n\nWe\u2019re going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that\u2019s already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. We\u2019re going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week. We\u2019re going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that you\u2019re in charge of your own energy bills.\n\nWe\u2019re going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. That\u2019s what we need to keep going. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. That\u2019s the choice that we face. And that\u2019s the choice that\u2019s facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren\u2019t needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nAnd as long as I\u2019m President, I\u2019m betting on the future. And as the people I\u2019ve talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. That\u2019s what we do as Americans. That\u2019s who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that we\u2019re going to do that again. Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n11:08 A.M.
