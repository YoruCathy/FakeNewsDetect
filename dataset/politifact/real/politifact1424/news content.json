Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the web. Recent data shows that nearly 50 percent of adults are active on social networks, nearly two-thirds watch online videos on sites such as YouTube, while over seven million people have joined the fastest-growing online member community, Twitter. Apparently no one has faxed that data to congressional Democrats, however, as the vast majority has yet to incorporate many of these popular technologies into their day-to-day communications. Meanwhile, House Republicans, seeing a unique opportunity to communicate directly with the American people without the traditional media filters of the past, are busy forging new connections with their constituents online. A recently-released report, Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress shows us the most glaring example of this party disparity:\n\n\n\n\u201cMore Republicans Use Twitter Than Democrats - In Congress, there are 132 members who are using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats..in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13 percent of the Republican Caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the Democratic Caucus).\"\n\nBut Twitter isn\u2019t the only online community dominated by Republicans. Even as they find themselves in a 40 seat minority, House Republicans\u2019 videos consistently outperform those of their counterparts on YouTube. The below chart, provided by industry analyst TubeMogul, illustrates this significant gap:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressional Democrats\u2019 constituents aren\u2019t the only ones that can\u2019t find them online. The national media continues to chronicle the Republican advantage and the Democrats\u2019 lack of interest in social media:\n\n\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe Republican leadership in the House is both aggressive and popular on Twitter. The party\u2019s top two members in the House - John A. Boehner of Ohio and Eric Cantor of Virginia, respectively - have the most followed Twitter accounts in the chamber. Mr. Boehner and the No. 3 Republican in the House, Mike Pence of Indiana, had also combined to send out more than 3,000 Tweets .\u201d (\n\n\n\n\u2022 \u201cA report on lawmakers\u2019 use of Twitter is out today and the results may surprise. \u2018Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress\u2019 by Mark Senak, a Democrat, finds that as of this month, Republican House members have sent out 529% more tweets than their Democratic counterparts .
