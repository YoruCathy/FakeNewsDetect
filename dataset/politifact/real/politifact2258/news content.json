Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY), Ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, issued a joint statement today after the U.S. State Department confirmed that Feisal Abdul Rauf, imam of the proposed \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d in New York City, will travel to the Middle East through a taxpayer-funded program of the International Information Programs Bureau at the State Department. Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf\u2019s trip to the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is \u2013 a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe State Department\u2019s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration\u2019s policy and funding priorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nBackground: In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S. He called the attacks \u201ca reaction against the U.S. Government politically\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened\u2026 We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world. In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA.\u201d\n\n\n\nNote: On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf \u201ca distinguished Muslim cleric\u201d and noted that the State Department \u201csend[s] people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society.\u201d\n\n\n\n######", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4477466276_5b11ff5933_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2438/4093010783_a11ce3045b_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2655/4093048815_216769b8b1_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://cdn.printfriendly.com/pf-icon-small.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2647/4093047995_2e369b108d_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2462/4093482522_5ce2eee573_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4585055608_5f5a0bba17_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2719/4093812806_01cdb20964_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2754/4477474820_464fbb2ee0_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2763/4476774905_7f7982ec98_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2449/4092716587_d983ded2c3_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/4093102561_e8eccd6752_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/img/btnShare.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100821215324im_/http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2757/4093404710_6aafcfceab_s.jpg"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
