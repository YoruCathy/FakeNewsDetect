Fred Thompson spoke before McCain addressed the crowd at the Nashville landmark.\n\nMcCain covered several topics as people rose to their feet to ask questions.\n\nMcCain said he hasn't chosen a vice presidential running mate.\n\n\"I'm the only Republican in my whole family so you can imagine what hell I get,\" one man told McCain as people applauded. \"But I like you. I'm the only one in my family that likes you.\"\n\nLaughter filled the theater.\n\n\"Maybe I could meet them sometime,\" McCain after chuckling.\n\nHe reportedly likes this interactive style of campaigning because it keeps him on his toes. He never skipped a beat Monday even when challenged by audience members.\n\nMcCain reiterated his support for a summer gas tax break for Americans in response to rising fuel prices. He emphasized the need for America to keep troops in Iraq. He also said the nation does not need to negotiate with Iran.\n\nHe emphasized differences between his positions and that of chief rival Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. He didn't mention New York Sen. Hillary Clinton until someone in the audience asked him about her.\n\nThe Arizona senator attended private fundraisers in Nashville. He will travel to Memphis Tuesday for a private fundraiser.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20080610072007im_/http://wtvf.images.worldnow.com/images/207456_LA.jpg",
