Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.\n\nI just wanted to say a few words about why we\u2019re here today. And one reason why I\u2019m here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.\n\nSo I couldn\u2019t think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.\n\nWe\u2019ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I don\u2019t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you\u2019re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we haven\u2019t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty \u2014 that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem?\n\nIt is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation \u2014 or not having enough money.\n\nWe treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, we\u2019ve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in people\u2019s budgets: health care,child care, energy, education \u2014 with almost no coordination among them.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you don\u2019t make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.\n\nAnd because we\u2019ve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and you\u2019ll lose a ton. So we think we\u2019ve been filling holes. But we\u2019ve actually been building a trap. And that\u2019s because poverty is about more than deprivation; it\u2019s about isolation.\n\nThere are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They don\u2019t have the support they need to grow, whether it\u2019s a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.\n\nWhat they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Don\u2019t just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.\n\nDon\u2019t measure success based on inputs. Measure the results.\n\nAnd this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington.\n\nIt is the people in our communities \u2014 the people with credibility. They\u2019re the ones who can break through. And I\u2019m not saying just cut money for the safety net. I\u2019d say spend the same amount of money we do now \u2014 because this isn\u2019t about saving money; it\u2019s about saving lives.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, don\u2019t minimize; customize. Take the money we\u2019re spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each person\u2019s needs. And whatever you do,encourage work \u2014 because that\u2019s how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow.\n\nThey\u2019ll not only have enough money; they\u2019ll be able to make enough money to get off assistance.\n\nThe way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities \u2014 they\u2019re the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines.\n\nNow, I know a lot of people are wondering, \u201cWhy do you care about this? You\u2019re Republicans.\u201d\n\nI remind them, \u2018Well, we\u2019re Americans too.\u2019 We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesn\u2019t determine the outcome of your life.\n\nIf you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself.\n\nBut a lot of people don\u2019t think that\u2019s true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not enough to pay your taxes and think, \u201cGovernment is going to take care of this.\u201d We all have to get involved.\n\nAnd I know it\u2019s easy to get discouraged. But what I\u2019ve learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; they\u2019re already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not they\u2019re right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.\n\nSo I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America.", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*M9jaH_rsq0U6WuBsdzlO9g.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/0*3s5gC-BvDyqnmqhS.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/4000/1*6n2LsiXpn3z9dXQjLF3vPg.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*M9jaH_rsq0U6WuBsdzlO9g.jpeg?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*3s5gC-BvDyqnmqhS.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*M9jaH_rsq0U6WuBsdzlO9g.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*6n2LsiXpn3z9dXQjLF3vPg.jpeg?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pJe9YRr-8Xe7pGIjhSu17A.jpeg?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/5000/1*pJe9YRr-8Xe7pGIjhSu17A.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*M9jaH_rsq0U6WuBsdzlO9g.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://medium.com/@PRyan/expanding-opportunity-kempforum16-11fe61f733d2", "title": "Expanding Opportunity \u2014 #KempForum16", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}, "url": {"iphone": "medium://p/11fe61f733d2"}}, "title": "Expanding Opportunity \u2014 #KempForum16", "site": "@Medium", "description": "Let\u2019s get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America.
