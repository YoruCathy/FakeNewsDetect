Download the free player.\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Friend,This is probably one of the longest emails I\u2019ve ever sent, but it could be the most important.Across the country we are seeing vigorous debate about health insurance reform.Unfortunately, some of the old tactics we know so well are back \u2014 even the viral emails that fly unchecked and under the radar, spreading all sorts of lies and distortions.As President Obama said at the town hall in New Hampshire, \"where we do disagree, let's disagree over things that are real, not these wild misrepresentations that bear no resemblance to anything that's actually been proposed.\"So let\u2019s start a chain email of our own. At the end of my email, you\u2019ll find a lot of information about health insurance reform, distilled into 8 ways reform provides security and stability to those with or without coverage, 8 common myths about reform and 8 reasons we need health insurance reform now.Right now, someone you know probably has a question about reform that could be answered by what\u2019s below. So what are you waiting for? Forward this email.Thanks,DavidDavid AxelrodSenior Adviser to the PresidentP.S. We launched www.WhiteHouse.gov/realitycheck this week to knock down the rumors and lies that are floating around the internet. You can find the information below, and much more, there. For example, we've just added a video of Nancy-Ann DeParle from our Health Reform Office tackling a viral email head on.
