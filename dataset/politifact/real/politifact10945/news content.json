Thank you so very, very much.\n\nIt is wonderful to be here with all of you.\n\nTo be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.\n\nTo be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.\n\nTo be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.\n\nAnd in a place\u2026 with absolutely no ceilings.\n\nYou know, President Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation\u2019s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nTwo Democrats guided by the \u2014 Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.\n\nPresident Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there\u2019s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: \u201cEquality of opportunity\u2026 Jobs for those who can work\u2026 Security for those who need it\u2026 The ending of special privilege for the few\u2026 The preservation of civil liberties for all\u2026 a wider and constantly rising standard of living.\u201d\n\nThat still sounds good to me.\n\nIt\u2019s America\u2019s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.\n\nThat bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.\n\nIt\u2019s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.\n\nIt\u2019s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.\n\nWhen President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.\n\nWhen President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.\n\nWe\u2019re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.\n\nInstead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the end.\n\nAs we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.\n\nYou worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs\u2026 you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again \u2013 going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.\n\nSo we\u2019re standing again. But, we all know we\u2019re not yet running the way America should.\n\nYou see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.\n\nWhile many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America\u2019s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.\n\nSo, you have to wonder: \u201cWhen does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\nI say now.\n\nProsperity can\u2019t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.\n\nDemocracy can\u2019t be just for billionaires and corporations.\n\nProsperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.\n\nYou brought our country back.\n\nNow it\u2019s time \u2014 your time to secure the gains and move ahead.\n\nAnd, you know what?\n\nAmerica can\u2019t succeed unless you succeed.\n\nThat is why I am running for President of the United States.\n\nHere, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.\n\nI\u2019m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.\n\nFor the successful and the struggling.\n\nFor the innovators and inventors.\n\nFor those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.\n\nFor the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.\n\nFor the nurses who work the night shift.\n\nFor the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.\n\nFor the veterans who served our country.\n\nFor the small business owners who took a risk.\n\nFor everyone who\u2019s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\n\nI\u2019m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.\n\nOur country\u2019s challenges didn\u2019t begin with the Great Recession and they won\u2019t end with the recovery.\n\nFor decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.\n\nAdvances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.\n\nThe financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value\u2026 too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.\n\nOur political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they\u2019ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.\n\nNow, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we\u2019ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.\n\nOur next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that \u2014 to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.\n\nAt our best, that\u2019s what Americans do. We\u2019re problem solvers, not deniers. We don\u2019t hide from change, we harness it.\n\nBut we can\u2019t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.\n\nAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.\n\nNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\u2019re all singing the same old song\u2026\n\nA song called \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nYou know the one \u2014 all our troubles look as though they\u2019re here to stay\u2026 and we need a place to hide away\u2026 They believe in yesterday.\n\nAnd you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try singing that, too, I\u2019ll tell you!\n\nThese Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.\n\nAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\u2019ll say: \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist.\u201d Well, then, why don\u2019t they start listening to those who are?\n\nThey pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.\n\nThey want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.\n\nThey shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.\n\nThey want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.\n\nAnd they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.\n\nFundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called \u201ca village\u201d that has a place for everyone.\n\nNow, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.\n\nI believe that success isn\u2019t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty\u2026\n\nHow many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive\u2026\n\nHow many young people go to college without drowning in debt\u2026\n\nHow many people find a good job\u2026\n\nHow many families get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nI didn\u2019t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.\n\nMy mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.\n\nHer own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.\n\nYou know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.\n\nThe 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.\n\nThe woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.\n\nAnd, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.\n\nTo meet every challenge.\n\nTo be resilient\u2026 no matter what the world throws at you.\n\nTo solve the toughest problems.\n\nI believe we can do all these things because I\u2019ve seen it happen.\n\nAs a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.\n\nMy first job out of law school was for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn\u2019t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.\n\nAs a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.\n\nIn Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.\n\nAs Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.\n\nIt took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.\n\nThere are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.\n\nJust weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn\u2019t quite so hard for families like hers?\n\nI want to be her champion and your champion.\n\nIf you\u2019ll give me the chance, I\u2019ll wage and win Four Fights for you.\n\nThe first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.\n\nTo make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.\n\nThe middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can\u2019t have one without the other.\n\nIs this possible in today\u2019s world?\n\nI believe it is or I wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\n\nDo I think it will be easy? Of course not.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can\u2019t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.\n\nThere are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.\n\nBusiness leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.\n\nThere are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.\n\nThere are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow\u2019s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I\u2019ll propose specific policies to:\n\nReward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck \u2013 because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.\n\nI will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.\n\nI will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.\n\nWe will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.\n\nWe will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.\n\nAnd we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\n\nDeveloping renewable power \u2013 wind, solar, advanced biofuels\u2026\n\nBuilding cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings\u2026\n\nUsing additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment\u2026\n\nAnd ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.\n\nNow, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.\n\nWe will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.\n\nWe will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.\n\nNow, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.\n\nThat\u2019s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.\n\nAnd I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that talent is universal \u2013 you can find it anywhere \u2013 but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.\n\nOur country won\u2019t be competitive or fair if we don\u2019t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.\n\nSo let\u2019s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.\n\nLet\u2019s make college affordable and available to all \u2026and lift the crushing burden of student debt.\n\nLet\u2019s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.\n\nNow, the second fight is to strengthen America\u2019s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.\n\nAnd today\u2019s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.\n\nI believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.\n\nI believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.\n\nI believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.\n\nThat you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.\n\nI believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.\n\nAnd it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job \u2014 and women of color often making even less.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.\n\nIn America, every family should feel like they belong.\n\nSo we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.\n\nAnd, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.\n\nYou know, America\u2019s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what\u2019s drawn so many to our shores. What\u2019s inspired people all over the world. I know. I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes.\n\nAnd these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.\n\nSo we have a third fight: to harness all of America\u2019s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.\n\nNo other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran \u2013 and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.\n\nNo other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.\n\nAs your President, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.\n\nAnd if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.\n\nAs a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today\u2019s threats and tomorrow\u2019s.\n\nAnd when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I\u2019ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they\u2019ve earned.\n\nI\u2019ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.\n\nBut, I know \u2014 I know we have to be smart as well as strong.\n\nMeeting today\u2019s global challenges requires every element of America\u2019s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.\n\nThere are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there\u2019s a lot of good news out there too.\n\nI believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.\n\nAnd we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That\u2019s why we have to win the fourth fight \u2013 reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.\n\nWe have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.\n\nWe need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen\u2019s right to vote, rather than every corporation\u2019s right to buy elections.\n\nIf necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\n\nI want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.\n\nI\u2019ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.\n\nWhat part of democracy are they afraid of?\n\nNo matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.\n\nGovernment is never going to have all the answers \u2013 but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.\n\nThat means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.\n\nWe need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.\n\nTo do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I\u2019ll also stand my ground when I must.\n\nThat\u2019s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State \u2014 whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities \u2014 and it\u2019s something I will always do as your President.\n\nWe Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other\u2019s back.\n\nLike any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.\n\nPeople all over the world have asked me: \u201cHow could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?\u201d\n\nNow, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled \u2013 even killed \u2013 not hired as Secretary of State.\n\nBut President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That\u2019s how we do it in America.\n\nWith that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.\n\nWe can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.\n\nWe can strengthen our families.\n\nWe can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.\n\nAnd we can renew the promise of our democracy.\n\nIf we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.\n\nI want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.\n\nTalk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.\n\nText \u201cJOIN\u201d J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6.\n\nGo to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I\u2019m not stopping now.\n\nYou know, I know how hard this job is. I\u2019ve seen it up close and personal.\n\nAll our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.\n\nWell, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!\n\nAnd the first grandmother as well.\n\nAnd one additional advantage: You\u2019re won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\u2019ve been coloring it for years!\n\nSo I\u2019m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I\u2019m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.\n\nAnd along the way, I\u2019ll just let you in on this little secret. I won\u2019t get everything right. Lord knows I\u2019ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there\u2019s no shortage of people pointing them out!\n\nAnd I certainly haven\u2019t won every battle I\u2019ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.\n\nI think you know by now that I\u2019ve been called many things by many people \u2014 \u201cquitter\u201d is not one of them.\n\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.\n\nWhen I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I\u2019d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\n\nI can still hear her saying: \u201cLife\u2019s not about what happens to you, it\u2019s about what you do with what happens to you \u2013 so get back out there.\u201d\n\nShe lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century \u2014 all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.\n\nShe was born on June 4, 1919 \u2014 before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.\n\nThe story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us \u2013 not just some, but all \u2013 should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.\n\nNot only because we\u2019re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we\u2019re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.\n\nI wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.\n\nI wish she could have seen the America we\u2019re going to build together.\n\nAn America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.\n\nWhere we don\u2019t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.\n\nAn America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.\n\nThank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tim191125_cover_awkwafina3.jpg", "http://time.com/img/newsletter-round.svg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Frizell"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/", "title": "Hillary Clinton Transcript: Read Full Text of Clinton Campaign Launch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "2016 Election,Hillary Clinton", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, 2016 election, speech, Roosevelt Island, Bill Clinton, presidential election, full transcript, Hillary Clinton transcript,", "description": "Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday", "og": {"title": "Read the full text of Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/", "description": "Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/", "description": "Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/", "title": "Read the full text of Hillary Clinton's campaign launch speech", "description": "Hillary Clinton held the first major rally of her campaign on Saturday", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hillary-clinton-3.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
