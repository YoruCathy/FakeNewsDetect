And in 2004, she said, \"I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,\" he said.\n\nThe trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nOhio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nVermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention.\n\nOn another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nAsked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, \"The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.\"\n\nHe also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war \"in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed\" or were sent into the war zone without enough training.\n\nPolls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue.\n\nGiven that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race.\n\nAt the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House.\n\nHe said Clinton has \"essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals \"unless they are positive for American workers.\"\n\nTo an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns.\n\n\"Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,\" he said. \"But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20080226201453im_/http://ap.google.com/hostednews/img/vertical-space.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080226201453im_/http://ap.google.com/hostednews/img/google-logo-hosted.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080226201453im_/http://ap.google.com/hostednews/img/ap_logo.gif?hl=en", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080226201453im_/http://ap.google.com/media/ALeqM5j4MSEz2xPnACdNkIGyGj7FFH4mTw?size=s"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Espo"], "canonical_link": "", "title": "The Associated Press: Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support", "meta_data": {"googlebot": "unavailable_after: 25-Mar-2008 13:14:32 PDT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
