He sponsored and still champions a campaign-finance law that impinged on fundamental rights of political speech; he voted against the Bush tax cuts; he supported this year's amnesty bill, although he now says he understands the need to control the border before doing anything else.\" (Editorial, \"Romney for President,\" National Review, 12/11/07)\n\nRAY BRUN: \"Opposing tax cuts that would have helped our family, supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants, taking jobs away from Americans.\" COLLETT HILL: \"He wrote the amnesty bill that America rejected.\" BOB DEGANGE: \"He's not really listened to the American people.\" MARIE PALING: \"He's had his chance in Washington to make things better.\"\n\n- McCain Joined Ted Kennedy (D-MA) \"To Sponsor A Liberal Immigration Reform Bill.\" \"[McCain has] come into conflict with his fellow Republicans by joining with the senator Ted Kennedy to sponsor a liberal immigration reform bill that would allow illegal aliens to eventually become legal American citizens.\" (Jacob Weisberg, Op-Ed, \"Awaiting The Return Of The Bull Moose,\" The Financial Times, 4/13/06)\n\n\n\n- Senator McCain's 2006 Immigration Plan Would Allow 11 Million Illegals To Remain In The U.S. \"The McCain plan \u2013 which is being put forward in the U.S. House by Arizona GOP Congressmen Jeff Flake and Jim Kolbe \u2013 allows the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S. to stay in the country if they apply for legal status and pay a $2,000 fine.\" (Mike Sunnucks, \"Napolitano, Hayworth Criticize Bush On Illegal Immigration,\" The Phoenix Business Journal, 2/1/06) - Union Leader Editorial: McCain-Kennedy Proposal \"Would Encourage Border Jumping.\" \"Sens. John McCain and Ted Kennedy have a bill that, surprise, includes a generous guest worker program that would encourage border jumping. Illegals who register would have to pay a fine and taxes, but they would get to stay here and apply for permanent residency. That sure beats waiting at the border and hoping to be let in.\" (Editorial, \"Turnstile Security,\" The [Manchester, NH] Union Leader, 3/27/06) - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich Said McCain-Kennedy \"Actually Provides For Amnesty.\" NEWT GINGRICH: \"However, the bill you mentioned \u2013 the Kennedy McCain bill \u2013 actually provides for amnesty. And it provides for amnesty for millions of people whose first act in the U.S. was to break the law. I think amnesty is profoundly wrong. I think it sends exactly the wrong signal.\" (Fox News' \"The Big Story,\" 3/20/06) - Mark Krikorian: \"The McCain/Kennedy Amnesty Bill Has Been Unveiled, And It's The Same Hoax We've Fallen For Before.\" \"The McCain/Kennedy amnesty bill has been unveiled, and it's the same hoax we've fallen for before. Like the telemarketer who bilks a widow and then comes back in a different guise to charge a fee to 'help' her get the original money back, the anti-borders crowd created today's immigration crisis and is now offering as a solution the very policies that got us in this mess in the first place.\" (Mark Krikorian, \"Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me,\" National Review, 5/13/05) - Columnist Charles Krauthammer: 2007 Immigration Bill Supported By Sen. McCain Was \"Amnesty\" And \"Vacuous Nonsense.\" \"The immigration compromise being debated in Congress does improve our criteria for selecting legal immigrants. Unfortunately, its inadequacies in dealing with illegal immigration \u2013 specifically, in ensuring that 10 years from now we will not have a new cohort of 12 million demanding amnesty -- completely swamp the good done on legal immigration. ... The amnesty is triggered upon presidential certification that these bureaucratic benchmarks are met \u2013 regardless of what is actually happening at the border. What vacuous nonsense.\" (Charles Krauthmammer, Op-Ed, \"One Short Amendment,\" The Washington Post, 5/25/07) - Brian Darling, Heritage Foundation: \"It's Clear To Any Reasonable Person That This Is Amnesty.\" \"'It's clear to any reasonable person that this is amnesty,' said Brian Darling, director of Senate relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. 'It's forgiving individuals for being present in the country illegally and working in the country illegally as recently as five months ago.' That, he said, could come back to haunt McCain.\" (Christi Parsons, \"GOP Foes Trade Fire On Immigration,\" Chicago Tribune, 6/5/07)\n\nTo watch \"Remember,\" please see: http://tv.mittromney.com/?showid=728539", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/img/bg/bg_logo_small.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/img/btn/btnEmailFriend.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/img/btn/btnClose.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/img/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/favicon.ico", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/img/btn/btnGo.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/img/clear.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080108202709im_/https://www.mittromney.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Romney For President Launches New Television Ad, \"Remember\"", "meta_data": {"description": "On Thursday, January 3, Romney for President launched its newest television ad,", "keywords": "romney, mccain, television, ad, remember, new, hampshire"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
