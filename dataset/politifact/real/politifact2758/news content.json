In the address, Boehner notes that this is a new approach that hasn\u2019t been tried in Washington \u2013 by either party \u2013 and it is at the core of the Pledge to America, a governing agenda Republicans built by listening to the people.\n\n\n\nLeader Boehner recorded the weekly address earlier this week from Ohio, where he ran a small business and saw first-hand how Washington can make it harder for employers and entrepreneurs to meet a payroll and create jobs. Following is a transcript of Boehner\u2019s remarks. Audio of the Weekly Republican Address is available now here. The video will be available here for viewing and here for downloading.\n\n\n\n\u201cHello. I\u2019m John Boehner.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I served in Congress, I ran a small business here in Ohio, and I saw first-hand how politicians in Washington can make it harder for small employers to meet a payroll and create jobs.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the final days of the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to \u2018change this country and change the world.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know about the world, but here at home, Americans haven\u2019t experienced the change President Obama promised. One in ten of our fellow citizens is out of work. Our national debt has grown by $3 trillion Trust in government has fallen to an all-time low.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese problems didn\u2019t start under President Obama. But instead of fixing them, his policies have made them worse. A \u2018stimulus\u2019 spending spree that created jobs in China and El Salvador, while millions of Americans lost their jobs here. A job-killing national energy tax. A government takeover of health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll these things have combined to create massive uncertainty for small businesses, the engine of job creation in America, while our children face a future clouded by debt.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmericans are demanding a new way forward in Washington \u2013 an approach that neither party has tried.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it; making government smaller and more accountable; and helping small businesses get back to creating jobs again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Republicans are offering with our Pledge to America, a governing agenda built by listening to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cA generation of fiscal recklessness in Washington has pushed us to the brink. Just to stay afloat, we\u2019re now borrowing 41 cents of every dollars we spend from our kids and grandkids.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis spending spree threatens our children\u2019s future. It\u2019s also hurting our economy. Americans know it has to stop, and our Pledge to America puts forth a plan to do just that. We\u2019re ready to cut spending to pre-\u2018stimulus,\u2019 pre-bailout levels, saving taxpayers $100 billion almost immediately. And we\u2019re ready to put in place strict budget caps that limit spending from here on out, to ensure that Washington is no longer on this spending binge.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to stop the coming tax hike. We can\u2019t balance the budget without cutting spending and achieving real economic growth \u2013 and we won\u2019t have real economic growth if we raise taxes on small businesses and families.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and that\u2019s change Congress itself. The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them \u2013 something they didn\u2019t get when the \u2018stimulus\u2019 was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called \u2018comprehensive\u2019 bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view \u2013 not written in the Speaker\u2019s office, behind closed doors.\n\n\n\n\u201cAcross our nation, Americans are looking at President Obama\u2019s policies and asking \u2013 \u2018where are the jobs?\u2019 To help our economy get back on track, we have to stop all of the coming tax hikes and cut spending \u2013 and to cut spending, we need to change Congress itself.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a new way forward that hasn\u2019t been tried in Washington yet. It\u2019s a break from the direction in which President Obama has taken our country. And frankly, it\u2019s also a break from the direction in which Republicans were headed when Americans last entrusted us with the reins of government. The American people are in charge, and they deserve nothing less.\n\n\n\n\u201cTogether, we can do these things. And in doing so, we can begin the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government that honors our Constitution and respects the will of the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese ideas are at the core of our Pledge to America.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried it President Obama\u2019s way. We\u2019ve tried it Washington\u2019s way. It hasn\u2019t worked. It\u2019s time to put the people back in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you for your time and may God bless the United States of America.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "In Weekly Republican Address, Boehner Calls For \u201cNew Way Forward\u201d Focused on Creating Jobs, Cutting Spending, & Reforming Congress", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
