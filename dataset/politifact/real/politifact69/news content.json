R. 2122 To require background checks at gun shows, and for other purposes. _______________________________________________________________________ IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 10, 1999 Mr. McCollum (for himself and Mr. Hyde) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary _______________________________________________________________________ A BILL To require background checks at gun shows, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act''. SEC. 2. MANDATORY BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN SHOWS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, the vast majority of whom are law-abiding individuals with no desire to participate in criminal transactions; (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and other organized events, at which a large number of firearms are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the national firearms market; (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events move easily in and substantially affect interstate commerce; (4) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at which firearms may be bought and sold, often without background checks and without records that enable gun tracing; (5) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, criminals and other prohibited persons can obtain guns without background checks and can use such guns that cannot be traced to later commit crimes; (6) firearms associated with gun shows have been transferred illegally to residents of another State by Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited persons; and (7) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United States, to ensure, by enactment of this section, that criminals and other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events. (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(35) The term `gun show' means an event which is sponsored to foster the collecting, competitive use, sporting use, or any other legal use of firearms, and-- ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more of the firearms has been shipped or transported in, or the event otherwise affects, interstate or foreign commerce; and ``(B) at which there are not less than 10 firearm vendors. ``(36) The term `gun show organizer' means any person who organizes or conducts a gun show. ``(37) The term `gun show vendor' means any person who, at a fixed, assigned, or contracted location, exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, or exchanges 1 or more firearms at a gun show.''. (c) Regulation of Firearms Transfers at Gun Shows.-- (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of such title is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Sec. 931. Regulation of firearms transfers at gun shows ``(a)(1) A person who is not a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, and who desires to be registered as an instant check registrant shall submit to the Secretary an application which-- ``(A) contains a certification by the applicant that the applicant meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 923(d)(1); and ``(B) contains a photograph and fingerprints of the applicant; and ``(C) is in such form as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe. ``(2)(A) The Secretary shall approve an application submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) which meets the requirements of paragraph (1). On approval of the application and payment by the applicant of a fee of $100 for 3 years, and upon renewal of valid registration a fee of $50 for 3 years, the Secretary shall issue to the applicant an instant check registration, and advise the Attorney General of the United States of the same, which entitles the registrant to contact the national instant criminal background check system established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act for information about any individual desiring to obtain a firearm at a gun show from any transferor who has requested the assistance of the registrant in complying with subsection (c) with respect to the transfer of the firearm, and receive information from the system regarding the individual, during the 3-year period that begins with the date the registration is issued. ``(B) The Secretary shall approve or deny an application submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) within 60 days after the Secretary receives the application.

An instant check registrant shall remit to the Secretary all records required to be kept by the registrant under this subsection when the registration is no longer valid, has expired, or has been revoked. ``(4)(A) This subsection shall not be construed-- ``(i) as creating a cause of action against any instant check registrant or any other person, including the transferor, for any civil liability; or ``(ii) as establishing any standard of care. ``(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except to give effect to subparagraph (C), evidence regarding the use or nonuse by a transferor of the services of an instant check registrant under this section shall not be admissible as evidence in any proceeding of any court, agency, board, or other entity for the purposes of establishing liability based on a civil action brought on any theory for harm caused by a product or by negligence. ``(C)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who is-- ``(I) an instant check registrant who assists in having a background check performed in accordance with this section; ``(II) a licensee who acquires a firearm at a gun show from a nonlicensee, for transfer to another nonlicensee in attendance at the show, for the purpose of effectuating a sale, trade, or transfer between the 2 nonlicensees, all in the manner prescribed for the acquisition and disposition of firearms under this chapter; or ``(III) a nonlicensee disposing of a firearm, who utilizes the services of an instant check registrant pursuant to subclause (I) or a licensee pursuant to subclause (II), shall be entitled to immunity from a civil liability action as described in this subparagraph. ``(ii) A qualified civil liability action may not be brought in any Federal or State court. The term `qualified civil liability action' means a civil action brought by any person against a person described in clause (i) for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of the firearm by the transferee or a third party, but shall not include an action-- ``(I) brought against a transferor convicted under section 924(h), or a comparable or identical State felony law, by a party directly harmed by the transferee's criminal conduct, as defined in section 924(h); or ``(II) brought against a transferor for negligent entrustment or negligence per se. ``(4) A registration issued under this subsection may be revoked pursuant to the procedures provided for license revocations under section 923. ``(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to organize or conduct a gun show unless the person-- ``(1) registers with the Secretary in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, which shall not require the payment of any fee for such registration;
