Alice Palmer, the longtime progressive activist from the city's South Side. And they kept challenging petitions until every one of Obama's four Democratic primary rivals was forced off the ballot.\n\n\n\nFresh from his work as a civil rights lawyer and head of a voter registration project that expanded access to the ballot box, Obama launched his first campaign for the Illinois Senate saying he wanted to empower disenfranchised citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in that initial bid for political office, Obama quickly mastered the bare-knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics. His overwhelming legal onslaught signaled his impatience to gain office, even if that meant elbowing aside an elder stateswoman like Palmer.\n\n\n\nA close examination of Obama's first campaign clouds the image he has cultivated throughout his political career: The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field, but by clearing it.\n\n\n\nOne of the candidates he eliminated, long-shot contender Gha-is Askia, now says that Obama's petition challenges belied his image as a champion of the little guy and crusader for voter rights.\n\n\n\n\"Why say you're for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates?\" Askia said. \"He talks about honor and democracy, but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot-free? Why not let the people decide?\"\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview, Obama granted that \"there's a legitimate argument to be made that you shouldn't create barriers to people getting on the ballot.\"\n\n\n\nBut the unsparing legal tactics were justified, he said, by obvious flaws in his opponents' signature sheets. \"To my mind, we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up,\" Obama recalled.\n\n\n\n\"I gave some thought to \u2026 should people be on the ballot even if they didn't meet the requirements,\" he said. \"My conclusion was that if you couldn't run a successful petition drive, then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether the district's primary voters were well-served by having only one candidate, Obama smiled and said: \"I think they ended up with a very good state senator.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nObama behind challenges\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nnext\n\nAmerica has been defined in part by civil rights and good government battles fought out in Chicago's 13th District, which in 1996 spanned Hyde Park mansions, South Shore bungalows and poverty-bitten precincts of Englewood.It was in this part of the city that an eager reform Democrat by the name of Abner Mikva first entered elected office in the 1950s. And here a young, brash minister named Jesse Jackson ran Operation Breadbasket, leading marchers who sought to pressure grocery chains to hire minorities.Palmer served the district in the Illinois Senate for much of the 1990s. Decades earlier, she was working as a community organizer in the area when Obama was growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. She risked her safe seat to run for Congress and touted Obama as a suitable successor, according to news accounts and interviews.But when Palmer got clobbered in that November 1995 special congressional race, her supporters asked Obama to fold his campaign so she could easily retain her state Senate seat.Obama not only refused to step aside, he filed challenges that nullified Palmer's hastily gathered nominating petitions, forcing her to withdraw.\"I liked Alice Palmer a lot. I thought she was a good public servant,\" Obama said. \"It was very awkward. That part of it I wish had played out entirely differently.\"His choice divided veteran Chicago political activists.\"There was friction about the decision he made,\" said City Colleges of Chicago professor emeritus Timuel Black, who tried to negotiate with Obama on Palmer's behalf. \"There were deep disagreements.\"Had Palmer survived the petition challenge, Obama would have faced the daunting task of taking on an incumbent senator. Palmer's elimination marked the first of several fortuitous political moments in Obama's electoral success: He won the 2004 primary and general elections for U.S. Senate after tough challengers imploded when their messy divorce files were unsealed.\n\nMore articles\n\nGet chicagotribune.com news by e-mail.
