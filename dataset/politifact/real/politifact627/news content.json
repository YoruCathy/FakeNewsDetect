He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is \u201cabout the size of Senator Obama\u2019s foreign-policy team.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nMany on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.\n\nMr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, \u201cthe first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cThis is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, \u201cI have to be against the tax increases, as you know,\u201d and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it\u2019s closer to $5 a gallon.\n\nAt one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his \u201cmaverick\u201d stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?\n\nIn a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the \u201cChristian right.\u201d\n\nMr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush\u2019s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.\n\nAs for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a \u201ctraitor,\u201d Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.\n\nHe said he himself had been called \u201cdisloyal\u201d by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn\u2019t work. He said he had been \u201cdeclared dead,\u201d but he was reminded of Chairman Mao\u2019s saying that \u201cit\u2019s always darkest before it\u2019s totally black.\u201d But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, \u201che voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.\u201d He added: \u201cI think he\u2019s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,\u201d he said, to sustained applause.\n\nHe also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, \u201cwe passed up an opportunity\u201d to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.\n\nHe also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cThe kind of war they\u2019re fighting requires long-term commitment,\u201d he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.\n\nOn the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA\u2019s \u201cDancing Queen\u201d was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve Got You Under My Skin.\u201d\n\nHe said that if he\u2019s \u201clacking in anything,\u201d it is an appreciation for music and art and \u201cthe other great things in life,\u201d partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.\n\n\u201cEverybody says, \u2018I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.\u2019How come everybody goes to \u2018Mamma Mia!?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody goes! They\u2019ve been selling out for years.\u201d\n\nAfter another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.\n\n\u201cI appreciate art,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m going to do and I have the opportunity, it\u2019s to take a class in art.\u201d He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, \u201cbut some of the things weren\u2019t there that I would like to see.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I make no excuses for my taste in music.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2008/08/15/us/politics/johnmccain-aspen533.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/thecaucus/thecaucus_post.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katharine Q.
