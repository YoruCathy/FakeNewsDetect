But as someone who's shared a stage with her many times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the Children's Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.\n\nAnd you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.\n\nOur party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThere are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because of this primary, there are millions of Americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Remarks in St. Paul", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2008-06-03T12:28:00.000Z", "modified": "2008-06-04T03:10:44.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "Presidential Election of 2008", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 1194781760371, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1e2b0f51-5707-5d69-b9c1-a194ab1b385c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/0d4ccb51fc004ba2966371e4539e3015", "description": "The following a transcript of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s speech to supporters on the last night of voting in the primary campaign, as provided by CQ Transcriptions.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,St Paul MN,2008 Presidential Election", "pdate": 20080603, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "type": "article", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Remarks in St. Paul", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "The following a transcript of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s speech to supporters on the last night of voting in the primary campaign, as provided by CQ Transcriptions."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "title": "Barack Obama\u2019s Remarks in St. Paul", "description": "The following a transcript of Senator Barack Obama\u2019s speech to supporters on the last night of voting in the primary campaign, as provided by CQ Transcriptions.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1e2b0f51-5707-5d69-b9c1-a194ab1b385c"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "PT": "article", "PST": "Text", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1e2b0f51-5707-5d69-b9c1-a194ab1b385c", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/us/politics/03text-obama.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1212422400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
