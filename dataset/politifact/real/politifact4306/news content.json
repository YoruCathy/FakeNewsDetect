In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion \u2014 a staggering $227.4 million on average \u2014 but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.\n\nThe taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.)\n\nI know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn\u2019t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.\n\nTwelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country\u2019s finances. They\u2019ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It\u2019s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country\u2019s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.\n\nJob one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can\u2019t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.\n\nBut for those making more than $1 million \u2014 there were 236,883 such households in 2009 \u2014 I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more \u2014 there were 8,274 in 2009 \u2014 I would suggest an additional increase in rate.\n\nMy friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It\u2019s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/14/opinion/0815oped-art/0815oped-art-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/14/opinion/0815oped-art/0815oped-art-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/14/opinion/0815oped-art/0815oped-art-articleLarge.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Warren E.
