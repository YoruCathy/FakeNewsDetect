The company is also leasing warehouse space to two local manufacturers in need of additional staging.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to be able to partner with these local businesses to provide them with quality space and support services and, most importantly, keep these companies and jobs right here in Bryan,\u201d notes Martin Killgallon, President. \u201cOur commitment to the community is important to our strategy and we look forward to continuing to partner with other local businesses.\u201d\n\nThe Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands have been sold to Spin Master Corp., a leading global children\u2019s entertainment company that creates, designs, manufactures and markets a diversified portfolio of innovative toys, games, products and entertainment properties. \u201cWe are very happy that children around the world will continue to be able to enjoy Etch A Sketch, one of the world\u2019s most iconic toys, as Spin Master is committed to building upon the success that The Ohio Art Company has created and sustained for more than 50 years,\u201d West concludes.", "images": ["https://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-OA-Metal-Litho-Logo-32x32.png", "http://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web-metal.png", "https://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/etchasketch-e1462795278748.jpeg", "https://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Vintage-Ohio-Art-Logo-e1542006636648.png", "http://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BillWaters-e1461722494797.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-OA-Metal-Litho-Logo-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://ohioart.com/etch-a-sketch-sold-to-spinmaster/", "title": "Sale of the Etch A Sketch Brand", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "In February of 2016, we announced the sale of our Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands in a move designed to allow us to focus on its metal lithography", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ohioart.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-OA-Metal-Litho-Logo-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.ohioart.com", "summary": ""}
