Trump on the Stakes of the Election\n\nDownload PDF\n\nToday I\u2018d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.\n\nPeople have asked me why I am running for President.\n\nI have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.\n\nWe come to work together and turn visions into reality.\n\nWe think big, and then we make it happen.\n\nI love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.\n\nSo when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.\n\nWhen I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton \u2013 only by me.\n\nThe fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!\n\nEverywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can\u2019t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\n\nWe will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.\n\nThe insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking Bernie Sanders\u2019 voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not just the political system that\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s the whole economy.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.\n\nIt\u2019s rigged against you, the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar \u2013\n\njust look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[1]\n\nBrian Williams\u2019 career was destroyed for saying far less.\n\nYesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.\n\nI am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.\n\nWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.\n\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.\n\nHere is my promise to the American voter:\n\nIf I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests \u2013 and taking money from special interests.\n\nHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.\n\nShe ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund \u2013 doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.\n\nThen, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests \u2013 in less than 2 years \u2013 secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [2] [3]\n\nTogether, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.[4]\n\nThey totally own her, and that will never change.\n\nThe choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.\n\nThose are the stakes.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.\n\nShe believes she is entitled to the office.\n\nHer campaign slogan is \u201cI\u2019m with her.\u201d\n\nYou know what my response to that is? I\u2019m with you : the American people.\n\nShe thinks it\u2019s all about her.\n\nI know it\u2019s all about you \u2013 I know it\u2019s all about making America Great Again for All Americans.\n\nOur country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.\n\nWe got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism \u2013 focusing on what\u2019s good for America\u2019s middle class \u2013 to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.\n\nWe reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.\n\nThis is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nThis is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.\n\nWe need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.\n\nThat\u2019s what we mean by America First.\n\nOur country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.\n\nOur Founders understood this.\n\nOne of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \u201cthe encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\u201d in America.[5]\n\nOur first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:\n\n\u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d[6]\n\nI have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\u2019s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization.[7]\n\nWe\u2019ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[8]\n\nOur trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[9]\n\nThen she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property \u2013 a crime which is continuing to this day.[10]\n\nHillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.\n\nIn return, Hillary Clinton got rich!\n\nThe book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America\u2019s expense.\n\nShe gets rich making you poor.\n\nHere is a quote from the book: \u201cAt the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton\u2026at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\u201d\n\nThese funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[11]\n\nShe sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.\n\nHillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas \u2013 and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[12]\n\nNow, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book \u2013 deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)[13]\n\nBut this latest Clinton cover-up doesn\u2019t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career \u2013 and it will be even worse than the Clintons\u2019 NAFTA deal.\n\nI want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.\n\nWe don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.\n\nIt\u2019s not just our economy that\u2019s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars \u2013 and unleashed ISIS across the world.\n\nNo Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.\n\nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.\n\nAmong the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.\n\nAmbassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[14]\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department refused them all.\n\nShe started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.\n\nTo cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[15]\n\nHere is what one of the victim\u2019s mothers had to say:\n\n\u201cI want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don\u2019t want this person to be president.\u201d[16]\n\nIn 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.\n\nLibya was cooperating.\n\nIraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\n\nSyria was under control.\n\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\n\nEgypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.\n\nISIS wasn\u2019t even on the map.\n\nFast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed\n\nto almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.\n\nHer invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.\n\nThanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen \u2013 while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[17]\n\nShe helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora\u2019s box of radical Islam.\n\nThen, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[18]\n\nISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.\n\nISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality \u2013 and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.\n\nIn short, Hillary Clinton\u2019s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.\n\nIt all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[19]\n\nThough I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[20]\n\nBut Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn\u2019t wait to rush us off to war in Libya.\n\nShe lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.\n\nIn the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:\n\n\u201cShe simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve\n\nin the office\u2026from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true\u2026Her leadership style \u2013 volcanic, impulsive\u2026disdainful of the rules set for everyone else \u2013 hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d[21]\n\nPerhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.\n\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.[22]\n\nUnder her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth \u2013 with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[23] [24]\n\nAlready, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]\n\nThe father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[26]\n\nI only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.\n\nMaybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[27]\n\nHillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.\n\nHere is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:\n\nA foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[28]\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America\u2019s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.[29]\n\nHillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access \u2013 even though he had no national security credentials.[30]\n\nHillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State \u2013 plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [31]\n\nHillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[32]\n\nHillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[33]\n\nTo cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.\n\nHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments \u2013 perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China \u2013 putting all of America in danger.[34]\n\nThen there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.[35]\n\nWhile we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.\n\nSo they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.\n\nThis fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.\n\nWe can\u2019t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNational security is also immigration security \u2013 and Hillary wants neither.\n\nHillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.\n\nShe has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[36]\n\nThe first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.\n\nLet me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.\n\nShe lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[37]\n\nSadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.\n\nHere is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\u2019s letter:\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms\u2019 way \u2013 an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\u201d\n\nHillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.\n\nFor the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.\n\nHillary\u2019s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can\u2019t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\n\nHere are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:\n\nAppoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.\n\nChange immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs\n\nStand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many\n\nCancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas\n\nLift restrictions on energy production\n\nRepeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.\n\nPass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.\n\nImpose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.\n\nThere is one common theme in all of these reforms.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be America First.\n\nThis is why the stakes in November are so great.\n\nOn Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.\n\nThe voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don\u2019t need or want another Clinton or Obama.\n\nCome November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.\n\nThey will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s message is old and tired. Her message is that can\u2019t change.\n\nMy message is that things have to change \u2013 and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.\n\nAmericans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.\n\nThen we started thinking small.\n\nWe stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.\n\nWe lost our sense of purpose, and daring.\n\nBut that\u2019s not who we are.\n\nCome this November, we can bring America back \u2013 bigger and better, and stronger than ever.\n\nWe will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth \u2013 the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.\n\nOur military will have the best technology and finest equipment \u2013 we will bring it back all the way.\n\nMassive new factories will come roaring into our country \u2013 breathing life and hope into our communities.\n\nInner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.\n\nConstruction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.\n\nThe real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary\u2019s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.\n\nWe are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.\n\nI am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.\n\nOur country is going to start working again.\n\nPeople are going to start working again.\n\nParents are going to start dreaming big for their children again \u2013 including parents in our inner cities.\n\nAmericans are going to start believing in the future or our country.\n\nWe are going to make America rich again.\n\nWe are going to make America safe again.\n\nWe are going to make America Great Again \u2013 and Great Again For EVERYONE .\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] (\u201cSen.
