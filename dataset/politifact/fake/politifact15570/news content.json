He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.\n\nSeveral children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.\n\nWhile Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.\n\n\u201cWhen Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.\u201d The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s inner circle, added: \u201cIt should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.\u201d\n\nHe said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. \u201cagainst our national interests.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear who he\u2019s talking about and whether he\u2019s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.\n\nBut it obviously raises a concerning question.\n\nThere have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to believe.\n\nAnd it shouldn\u2019t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.\n\nThe problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can\u2019t get a straight answer.\n\nAsked about the cleric\u2019s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.\u201d Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official\u2019s allegation. \u201cThis sounds like totally made up BS,\u201d she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.\n\nThis would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.\n\nAnd in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran\u2019s elite. \u201cMany ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,\u201d Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. \u201cThe regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.\u201d Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: \u201cIranians don\u2019t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.\u201d\n\nThe protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didn\u2019t feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here.\n\nBut it could be interesting if it\u2019s the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back.", "images":
