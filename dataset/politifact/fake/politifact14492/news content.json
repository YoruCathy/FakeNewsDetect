I says to myself \u2018Oh Lawdy, someone\u2019s done come to rescue us!\u2019 and then it sails right past my house and smack straight into that yonder building,\u201d said Georgia Brown, a resident who witnessed the incident.\n\nFollowing incidents involving the USS Fitzgerald, USS John S. McCain, and the USS Ted Kennedy, this marks the fifth collision incident this summer for destroyers from the Navy\u2019s besieged 7th fleet.\n\nEven though the Navy declined to comment on the cause of the collision due to an ongoing investigation, it did say that the captain had been relieved of his command.\n\nA senior defense official theorized that the ship had likely veered off course from its patrol route in the South China Sea, despite reserve from the Navy.\n\nNavy officials have stated that they are planning a number of PowerPoint trainings related to urban maritime navigation.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/navy-destroyer-hit-buidling.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/feds-news-about-hillary-clinton-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/donald-turmp-land-texas-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/donald-turmp-land-texas-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/state-trooper-car-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/state-trooper-car-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/osberverd-93-yo-woman-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/louisiana-governor-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/osberverd-93-yo-woman-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mark-hamill-donald-trump-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/feds-news-about-hillary-clinton-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amnewslogo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/navy-destroyer-hit-buidling.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//web.archive.org/web/20170901172851/http://americannews.com/25127-2/", "title": "Unbelievable: Navy Destroyer Strikes A Building In Downtown Houston", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S....", "title": "Unbelievable: Navy Destroyer Strikes A Building In Downtown Houston", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/navy-destroyer-hit-buidling.jpg"}, "DC.date.issued": "2017-09-01T03:14:21+00:00", "referrer": "always", "og": {"site_name": "American News", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851/http://americannews.com/25127-2/", "title": "Unbelievable: Navy Destroyer Strikes A Building In Downtown Houston", "description": "The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S....", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901172851im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/navy-destroyer-hit-buidling.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 386}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1593609767543621}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-01T03:14:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-01T03:14:21+00:00", "author": "http://americannews.com/author/macey/", "section": "NEWS"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504235661.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
