Are we serious?\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to RedState, which recently fired a number of its staff for refusing to remain objective where President Trump is concerned, CNN explained:\n\nWe are forced to consider that in this terse political climate, we must fight to remain objective. What Marvin said was not in any way objective, and we do not in any way support attacking a woman\u2019s looks no matter what one\u2019s opinion of her is. We hope that this can help bridge the divide between the Left and Right, as we consider people of all political ideologies a vital and integral part of our audience.\n\nWhile this is unlikely to convince any of us that CNN isn\u2019t full of lies and misinformation, it\u2019s good to see them do the right thing for once.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181153im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cnn.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181153im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cnn-678x381.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181153im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-dwu-cover-1-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181153im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rated-S.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181153im_/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6da99efe1851b0b28fc6237913f8b88b?s=125&r=g&d=monsterid"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181153im_/https://dailyworldupdate.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cnn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About Janet Farrow", "Janet Farrow Is An Investigative Reporter With Years Experience Who Has Been Featured In Numerous Publications.
