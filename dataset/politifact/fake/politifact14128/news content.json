And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.\u201d\n\nBefore the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators \u2014 both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitch?\u201d while opponents chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\u201d\n\nAs Fox news reported earlier, the mayor\u2019s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "images":
