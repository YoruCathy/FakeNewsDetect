Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with \u201cradical\u201d positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking \u2013 I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That\u2019s what I believe,\u201d declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. \u201cI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that\u2019s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,\u201d Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would \u201cput rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just totally against the whole shebang, I won\u2019t deny it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it\u2019s father has done to you, come on.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.\u201d\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: \u201cDon\u2019t know yet, first thing\u2019s first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.\u201d/SOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-macron-645x325-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-macron-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-375x195.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/migrant..-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/b86fb2e8de61ad203b4c1b3a3332583d-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/140211213750-pmt-ann-coulter-hillary-rand-paul-00011020-horizontal-gallery-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fox_huckabee_brain_dead_140105a-615x345-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sandy-rios-400x300-645x325-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fox_huckabee_brain_dead_140105a-615x345-645x325-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/marco-rubio-645x325.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/140211213750-pmt-ann-coulter-hillary-rand-paul-00011020-horizontal-gallery-645x325-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sandy-rios-400x300-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mike-huckabee-645x325-145x100.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Benjamin-and-Sara-Netanyahu-are-with-Donald-Trump-and-Melania-645x325-375x195.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/marco-rubio-645x325.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170528095037/http://uspoln.com/2017/05/23/rubio-rape-victims-custody-suspicion-theyre-planning-abortion/", "title": "Rubio: \u201cRape Victims Should Be In Custody If There Is Suspicion That They\u2019re Planning Abortion\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rubio: \u201cRape Victims Should Be In Custody If There Is Suspicion That They\u2019re Planning Abortion\u201d", "description": "At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen.
