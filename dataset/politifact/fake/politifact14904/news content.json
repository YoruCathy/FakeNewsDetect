Our message to them, DO IT. We don\u2019t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O\u2019Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn\u2019t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.\n\nMike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry. He mentioned the lower paid support staff who do all of the behind the scenes work.\n\n\u201cThe people who do all the real work in Hollywood are the people who build the sets, who make the costumes, who create the props, and in some cases, do the stunts and the special effects,\u201dMike explained. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not getting the bazillion dollar deals.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about time that these jerkoffs realize that they aren\u2019t the only people in this world. The fact remains that Donald Trump is our President, whether they like it or not, and that isn\u2019t about to change.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that for the sake of everyone else in Hollywood these ignorant celebrities suck it up and deal with the fact that their candidate didn\u2019t win. Maybe if they took their heads out of their asses long enough to even listen to Trump\u2019s goals for his time in office they would feel different\n\nWatch one news network\u2019s story on the matter:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217im_/http://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?3908436&101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217im_/http://nourtey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-130-660x3301.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217im_/http://nourtey.com/wp-content/themes/mts_wordx/images/nothumb-related.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217im_/http://nourtey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jane-fonda1-160x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217im_/http://nourtey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lois-Lerner-998x5611-160x100.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217im_/http://nourtey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image-130-660x3301.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180109225217/http://nourtey.com/2017/12/30/hollywood-celebs-will-go-total-strike-trump-not-resign/", "title": "HOLLYWOOD CELEBS: WE WILL GO ON \u2018TOTAL STRIKE\u2019 IF TRUMP DOES NOT RESIGN", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "HOLLYWOOD CELEBS: WE WILL GO ON \u2018TOTAL STRIKE\u2019 IF TRUMP DOES NOT RESIGN - Nourtey", "description": "Many of Hollywood\u2019s elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President.
