The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away.\n\n\u2018As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoD\u2019s request for information about this \u201cevent\u201d, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion\u2013 Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73\u2014with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database \u201ctarget hit\u201d on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a \u201cprobable witness\u201d against the Clinton Foundation.,\n\n\u2018Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jersey\u2014and whose inclusion in the SVR\u2019s database of \u201cpotential witnesses\u201d against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a \u201ccentral identified and named figure\u201d in the creation of a document titled \u201cTraining Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine\u201d for the New Jersey Department of Education.\u2019\n\n\u2018Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis\u2014that is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death\u2014and whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)\u2014and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its \u201cemergency administration\u201d led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase it\u2014and their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission.\u2019\n\n\u2018Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a \u201cmain target\u201d person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US history\u2014that began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundation\u2014and that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Education\u2014and who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactions\u2014that, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses\u2019 offices throughout the United States\u2014with New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schools\u2014and that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their \u201cEpiPen Law\u201d that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do.\u2019\n\n\u2018Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Bresch\u2014who, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPens\u2014became the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.\u2014with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 million\u2014and whose \u201cprotection\u201d for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchin\u2019s husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin.\u2019\n\n\u2018To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her \u201cactive and knowing\u201d participation in the United States opioid crisis\u2014that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per year\u2014nearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma\u2014who, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a \u201cblind eye\u201d to their flooding of America with opioids\u2014and as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin\u2019s home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State.\u2019\n\n\u2018This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Tennessee\u2014and that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennessee\u2014that was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his State\u2014and whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal:\n\n\u201cPurdue\u2019s own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers.\n\nPurdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative \u2013 that long-term use of opioids didn\u2019t create addicts but instead caused \u201cpseudo addictive\u201d symptoms.\n\nThe groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessee\u2019s legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted.\n\nPurdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher \u201cquality of life.\u201d\n\nThe firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin \u2013 Purdue\u2019s financial rainmaker \u2013 was better for patients than other opioids on the market.\u201d\n\n<img src=\"https://media.8ch.net/file_store/b4a605f160e4e0f03903a232c185067ff24b83dd8a1f8b361f2be3dfc83dbdb3.jpeg\" style=\"max-height:640px;max-width:360px;\">\n\n<span style=\"margin-top:15px;rgba(42,51,6,0.7);font-size:12px;\">Credit:<a href=\"http://www.theeventchronicle.com/cabal-exposed/new-jersey-couple-set-to-testify-to-grand-jury-against-the-clintons-die-in-new-jersey-home-explosion-2/\"> The Event Chronicle </a></span\n\nAmerican nurse Carole Paladino (above) identified by SVR as being \u201cprobable witness\u201d against Clinton\n\nFoundation\n\nRelated Coverage: <a href=\"http://thegoldwater.com/news/29430\"> Clinton Body Count Series: #1.
