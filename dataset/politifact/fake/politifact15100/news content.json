The stakes are far higher and more complex,\u201d a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.\n\nKelly reportedly expressed his worries behind closed doors about the first daughter\u2019s utter lack of experience, however, the White House assured this past Monday that he was in support of her visit.\n\nCOMMENT BELOW\n\nLET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://politicsdepot.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://realtimepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RealTime_Politics_blk_logo-1-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_small/public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/28/16/jared-kushner-weak.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59307e75d234da193199ce7e/master/pass/jared-kushner-trump-split-pending.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/07/cde535409432dc786ab5578318a4763fdec48064.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://politicsdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ivanka-kushner-kelly.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://politicsdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ivanka-kushner-kelly.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541/http://politicsdepot.com/2018/02/28/kushner-and-wife-ivanka-trump-were-tossed-out-of-the-white-house/", "title": "Kushner And Wife Ivanka Trump Were Tossed Out Of The White House \u2014 And Donald Is Cutting Them Out Of His Will!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.7.5", "fb": {"pages": 979613892126968}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Kushner And Wife Ivanka Trump Were Tossed Out Of The White House -- And Donald Is Cutting Them Out Of His Will!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541/http://politicsdepot.com/2018/02/28/kushner-and-wife-ivanka-trump-were-tossed-out-of-the-white-house/", "type": "article", "description": "It's been a rough day for Trump's extended family as White House adviser\u00a0Jared Kushner's has officially had his security clearance downgraded from Top Secret to the Secret level, a major sign of disrespect to the young adviser.\n\n\n\nKushner, who is\u00a0President Trump's son-in-law, will no longer be a", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://politicsdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ivanka-kushner-kelly.jpg", "updated_time": "2018-02-28T16:47:35+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-28T16:47:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-28T16:47:35+00:00", "section": "ProudLiberal"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kushner And Wife Ivanka Trump Were Tossed Out Of The White House -- And Donald Is Cutting Them Out Of His Will!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://politicsdepot.com/2018/02/28/kushner-and-wife-ivanka-trump-were-tossed-out-of-the-white-house/", "description": "It's been a rough day for Trump's extended family as White House adviser\u00a0Jared Kushner's has officially had his security clearance downgraded from Top Secret to the Secret level, a major sign of disrespect to the young adviser.\n\n\n\nKushner, who is\u00a0President Trump's son-in-law, will no longer be a", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307001541im_/http://politicsdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ivanka-kushner-kelly.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519747200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
