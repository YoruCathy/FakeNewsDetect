He said it was necessary \u201cto ensure that agents in charge of border control are properly trained.\u201d\n\nHe called for \u201calternative solutions to detention\u201d for illegal immigrants and said \u201ccollective and arbitrary expulsions of migrants and refugees are not suitable solutions\u201d.\n\nFrancis said migrants should be seen as \u201ca true resource for the communities that welcome them\u201d and be given freedom of movement, access to means of communication, access to justice and everyday rights such as opening a bank account.\n\nFrancis, an Argentine who has made defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, has criticized anti-immigrant stands by national leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump. Last year, Francis condemned then-candidate Trump\u2019s intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico.\n\nMigrant children deserved particular protection, the pope said. They \u201cmust be spared any form of detention related to migratory status,\u201d guaranteed access to primary and secondary education and have the right to remain when they come of age.\n\nFrancis\u2019s message immediately drew the ire of the right-wing Northern League party in Italy because it implicitly supported a controversial law proposal that would grant citizenship to children who are born in Italy of immigrant parents.\n\n\u201cThe universal right to a nationality should be recognized and duly certified for all children at birth,\u201d the pope said.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Flight-Crew-Takes-A-Knee-And-Walks-Off-Leaving-New-Orleans-Saints-Stranded-On-Runway-1-800x445-240x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_514951309.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4-8-240x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_649637962.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_622381814.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ffve-800x445-240x160.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9876789876789.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_241294162.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2-6-678x381-800x445-240x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_324195443.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3-240x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_337132874.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lifestyle_504293641.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/travel_651306859.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health_164474051.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647im_/http://www.opreminfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9876789876789.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221647/http://www.opreminfo.com/2018/07/10/pope-says-that-the-rights-of-muslim-migrants-trump-any-safety-concerns-that-you-might-have-with-them-in-your-country/", "title": "Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country - opreminfo.com", "description": "Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants, saying their safety should take precedence over national security concerns and that they should not be subjected to collective deportations.
