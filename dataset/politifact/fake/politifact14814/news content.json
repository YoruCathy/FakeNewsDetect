They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.\n\nNucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 \u2014 $8,832.73 per month \u2014 according to public records.\n\nSixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera \u201chas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as \u2018n*ggers'\u201d. One of Nucera\u2019s officers \u201cmade numerous recordings\u201d of Nucera that \u201ccontained extremely offensive racist comments\u201d over the course of a year because he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Nucera\u2019s racism, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn\u2019t paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police \u201cescalated into a physical struggle,\u201d that both teens \u201cresisted arrest\u201d and that one of the officers used pepper spray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old\u2019s head and slammed it \u201cinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,\u201d according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old\u2019s head make \u201ca loud thud\u201d as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn\u2019t resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had \u201cstopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.\u201d The use of force wasn\u2019t reported to the department.\n\nHours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was \u201cf*cking tired\u201d of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cAnd that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,\u201d he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl\u2019s aunt, who was present at the arrest. \u201cFucking nipple hanging bitch. I\u2019m so tired of them, man.\u201d\n\nNucera allegedly said that black people should \u201cstay the fuck out of Bordentown\u201d and referred to the 18-year-old as \u201cfucking little, fucking n****r.\u201d\n\nIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to \u201cput my hands\u201d on him.\n\n\u201cThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,\u201d Nucera allegedly said. \u201cThey should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conduct alleged is shocking,\u201d acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.\u201d\n\nNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on a bail of $500,000.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849im_/https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849im_/https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole James"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849/https://www.truthexam.com/2017/11/new-jersey-police-chief-says-black-people-no-value-executed/", "title": "New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People \u2018Have No Value\u2019 And Should All Be Executed", "meta_data": {"description": "Frank Nucera Jr. just got what he deserves...", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People \u2018Have No Value\u2019 And Should All Be Executed", "description": "Frank Nucera Jr. just got what he deserves...", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849/https://www.truthexam.com/2017/11/new-jersey-police-chief-says-black-people-no-value-executed/", "site_name": "TruthExam.com", "updated_time": "2017-11-02T14:20:01-06:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849im_/https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg", "width": 780, "height": 438}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/nicolehickmanjames", "tag": "New Jersey", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2017-11-02T11:25:12-06:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-02T14:20:01-06:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000227298708, "pages": 1340186812659728}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Frank Nucera Jr. just got what he deserves...", "title": "New Jersey Police Chief Says Black People \u2018Have No Value\u2019 And Should All Be Executed", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171215062849im_/https://www.truthexam.com/files/2017/11/2017.11.02-04.20-truthexam-59fb45e3660a2.jpg", "creator": "@nicolejames"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.truthexam.com/files/images/msapplication-icon-144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eeeeee", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509643512.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
