The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. \u201cIt was horrific\u201d claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. \u201cThe water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere\u201d he recalls in tears.\n\nWithin 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.\n\nThe incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.\u2019s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.\n\n\u201cIt seems Japan just doesn\u2019t give a damn about international law\u201d explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. \u201cThe waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food\u201d he adds.\n\nJapan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.", "images": ["https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brosis-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/themes/mh_newsdesk/images/factsdontmatter3.png", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sanfranshit-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd5fa2547224fcf68fd4d923c535795a?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/natgeozebra-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6inchtube-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voodoohairdresser-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9dccac4da0bae923750ec9cf4110e496?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mermaidrape3-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ar15shortage-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grizzlyvictim-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resurect-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/lady-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wbrights-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TSAflashlight-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/480b26e453c0b1376eeb3179967a92a4?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bb6e65fdae60a89b5826fe6a756ff4b5?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/saudihorse-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flamegame-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/afghancovid-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com//worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/whale-greenpeace-300x208.png", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pizzaman-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/85e0266d46a85c696cab87453517e453?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oldalienprobes-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/manurevilla2-120x67.jpg"], "top_img": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bob Flanagan"], "canonical_link": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead/", "title": "Japanese Whaling Crew Eaten Alive By Killer Whales, 16 dead", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Japanese Whaling Crew Eaten Alive By Killer Whales, 16 dead", "url": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/japanese-whaling-crew-eaten-alive-by-killer-whales-16-dead/", "type": "article", "description": "A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16\u00a0crew members\u00a0and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.\r\nThe crew of the\u00a0MV Nisshin Maru\u00a0(\u65e5\u65b0\u4e38), Japan's primary whaling vessel and the world's only w", "image": {"identifier": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png", "url": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png", "secure_url": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/japan-whaling-boat.png", "width": 460, "height": 320}, "updated_time": "2016-05-09T22:51:12+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T06:25:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-09T22:51:12+00:00", "section": "Politics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1688449734707868}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1406528734.0, "source": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com", "summary": ""}
