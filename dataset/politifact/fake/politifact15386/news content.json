After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, things haven\u2019t gone quite as expected since the inception of Giuliani. He\u2019s caused the president more harm than good, notably when he contradicted the president\u2019s story regarding the hush payment sent to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nNow, it appears that instead of getting kicked off the team by Trump, the president is desperate enough to need Rudy in a full-time role.\n\nOn April 19th, Rudy officially went on leave from the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Today, the executive chairman of the firm, Richard Rosenbaum, announced that Rudy has formally resigned from the firm.\n\nRosenbaum said in a statement:\n\n\u201cWhen Rudy Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm, his intent was to play a limited role, for a short period of time, to address specific matters for President Trump. After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm, effective May 9th. I have a great deal of respect [for him] \u2026 and consider him a friend.\u201d\n\nThe key takeaway is the fact that Trump is desperate enough to need throwaway lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWhat is your reaction?\n\n*Please let us know in the comments section below*", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://truthclip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/StormyDanielsmichaelCohenCivil-810_3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://hotgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fgdhdgfhjfhjfhjf.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/https://d33b7zoetwsygv.cloudfront.net/uploads/2017/04/Logomakr_4GsdJr-2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://truthclip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/RudyGiulianiBuffoonAsksMuellerToStop-750_3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://hotgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fgdhdgfhjfhjfhjf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["J B"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537/http://hotgazette.com/rudy-giuliani/official-rudy-giuliani-officially-resigns-trumps-legal-team-on-its-last-leg/", "title": "OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Officially Resigns, Trump\u2019s Legal Team on Its Last Leg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://hotgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/favicon.png", "fb": {"pages": 1295220397267058}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Political Voice", "title": "OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Officially Resigns, Trump's Legal Team on Its Last Leg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537/http://hotgazette.com/rudy-giuliani/official-rudy-giuliani-officially-resigns-trumps-legal-team-on-its-last-leg/", "type": "article", "description": "After Trump's lead dog attorney, John Dowd, up and quit, the president ran into trouble trying to find his replacement.\u00a0 After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\u00a0 However, things haven't gone quite as expecte", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://hotgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fgdhdgfhjfhjfhjf.jpg", "updated_time": "2018-05-12T10:31:03+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-12T10:31:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-12T10:31:03+00:00", "section": "Rudy Giuliani"}, "twitter": {"title": "OFFICIAL: Rudy Giuliani Officially Resigns, Trump's Legal Team on Its Last Leg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://hotgazette.com/rudy-giuliani/official-rudy-giuliani-officially-resigns-trumps-legal-team-on-its-last-leg/", "description": "After Trump's lead dog attorney, John Dowd, up and quit, the president ran into trouble trying to find his replacement.\u00a0 After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\u00a0 However, things haven't gone quite as expecte", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180516034537im_/http://hotgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fgdhdgfhjfhjfhjf.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526121063.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
