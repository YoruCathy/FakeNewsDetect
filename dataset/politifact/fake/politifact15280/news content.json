What Israeli military leaders really worry about \u2014 but cannot talk about \u2014 is losing their nuclear monopoly.\n\nAn Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.\n\nIf Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.\n\nIt is, Clinton continues, the \u201cstrategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria\u201d that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel\u2019s security.\n\nThis would not come about through a \u201cdirect attack,\u201d Clinton admits, because \u201cin the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel\u201d this has never occurred, but through its alleged \u201cproxies.\u201d\n\nThe end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel\u2019s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.\n\nBringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel\u2019s security, it would also ease Israel\u2019s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.\n\nThen, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.\n\nClinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad \u201cand his family\u201d with violence is the \u201cright thing\u201d to do:\n\nIn short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.\n\nWith his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u2019s mind.\n\nThe email proves\u2014as if any more proof was needed\u2014that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to \u201cprotect\u201d Israel.\n\nIt is also a sobering thought to consider that the \u201crefugee\u201d crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria.\n\nIn addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq\u2014all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the \u201crebels\u201d and stoking the fires of war in Syria.\n\nThe real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton\u2014whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people\u2014could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all.\n\nClinton\u2019s public assertion that, if elected president, she would \u201ctake the relationship with Israel to the next level,\u201d would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth.", "images":
