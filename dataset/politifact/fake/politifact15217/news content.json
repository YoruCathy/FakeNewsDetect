Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.\n\nNever Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement \u201cFor survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting\u201d using the hashtag #NeverAgain.\n\nThe MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.\n\nPublic demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.\n\nEuropean political researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D. C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.\n\nDammegard received this email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department:\n\nGood morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event. If your are requesting additional information reference this event, please follow the below steps to file your Freedom of Information Act request: https://foia-dc.gov/App/Index.aspx If your have any additional question sor concerns, please feel free in contacting me directly. Officer Scott C. Earhardt, Badge No. 2372 Homeland Security Bureau\n\nSpecial Operations Division\n\nPlanning and Logistics\n\nMetropolitan Police Department\n\n2850 New York Ave., N.E.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20002\n\n202-671-6529 (Office)\n\n202-671-6522 (Planning)\n\n202-671-6511 (Station) Scott.Earhardt@dc.gov\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the email (source: Professor James Fetzer):\n\nAccording to the PDF document, Metropolitan Police Department, Washington.D.C., Scott Earhardt indeed is a detective there. Here\u2019s a screenshot I took from page 6 of the 65-page document:\n\nHere are some facts:\n\nThe shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration \u201c several months prior to the actual event\u201d.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow can Never Again MSD apply for a permit \u201cseveral months\u201d BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d demonstration \u201cseveral months\u201d BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?\n\nSee also:\n\n~Eowyn\n\nAdvertisements", "images":
