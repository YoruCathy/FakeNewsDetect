The despicable display reached the height of annoyance during every ego-stroking awards ceremony since President Trump was elected. All have turned into a Trump-trashing session for pissed of celebrities to get far too much off their chest about our unapologetic leader.\n\nHowever, not everyone in Hollywood shares the same opinion as the most outspoken offender, Meryl Streep, as Kurt Russell just showed her and all of Trump\u2019s other famous foes that it\u2019s time to shut up about our president.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard much from Russell lately, it\u2019s because he falls into the rare category of celebrities who isn\u2019t crying over Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss and doesn\u2019t feel that he needs to make his political opinions known. He\u2019s simply doing what he\u2019s paid well to do and wishes others in the biz would too. Since they continue to throw tantrums and trash Trump on a public stage, Russell reached his breaking point and finally fired back hard.\n\n\u201cThis is a business that\u2019s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent,\u201d Russell began in his blistering beratement of these overpaid crybabies after what Streep said at the Golden Globes. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge them that. I\u2019m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways,\u201d he added, as reported by the American Lookout. \u201cBut yeah, we think differently, and maybe that\u2019s cut me out of some things. I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said before dropping a brutal announcement on these Streep and her lemmings that left them burning.\n\nExplaining that they\u2019re not empowered in this business by their disgraceful attitudes against our leaders, the badass actor said they better be prepared to put their money where their nasty mouths are since they could be out of work. \u201cPeople know I get along great with all kinds of directors, all kinds of actors. And I tell you, you hire me, I will show up, 24/7, and I will give you 100%. I will help you fix whatever problems come up. You hire me, I\u2019m your boy. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s all about the work. And when that\u2019s done, I am done.\u201d\n\nKurt has said recently that \u201cthe last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political,\u201d which he just proved by clearly pointing out that nobody cares what celebrities have to say about politics, and that their obnoxious behavior only shows how unemployable they are. They need to just stick to what they are overpaid to do and leave the rest to the adults in charge.", "images":
