RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:\n\nDear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can\u2019t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian\n\nWhat that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he\u2019ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s office has already announced that the election won\u2019t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he\u2019ll waste the taxpayers\u2019 time and money with a fruitless recount.\n\nThey can never just admit when they lost.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/183-678x3811-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://defense-usa.xyz/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Trump20UN20speech20AP1-218x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GADjesse1-218x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/aaa-678x3812.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GADjeff122611-218x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/95fc33d4d30c9fe9a0b66ef6525845e4?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/82-678x3811-100x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1861-100x70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/aaa-678x3812.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229/http://patriotunited.site/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/", "title": "BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K Votes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229im_/http://patriotunited.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/aaa-678x3812.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228111229/http://patriotunited.site/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/", "title": "BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K Votes", "description": "The Alabama Secretary of State\u2019s Division\u00a0Of Electoral Balloting Integrity has begun sending emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count in the Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones Senatorial race.
