A short list of Francis\u2019s most controversial statements include:\n\nPREACHING THAT \u2018JESUS TURNED INTO SATAN\u2019\n\nPope Francis went where no other Christian, let alone Pope, had ever gone before, accusing Jesus of \u201cdebasing himself up to the point of totally annihilating himself\u201d, and \u201cturning into Satan.\u201d\n\nHardcore Francis apologists claim the quote was taken out of context, but when the passage is read in it\u2019s entirety it is clear that Francis meant exactly what he said.\n\nMaking matters worse, Pope Francis later doubled down, spreading Satanic doctrine further, when he said that Jesus Christ \u201cmade himself the devil, the serpent, for us,\u201d according to L\u2019Osservatore Romano, the daily newspaper of the Vatican.\n\nPREACHING THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH JESUS ARE \u2018HARMFUL\u2019\n\nThe heretical statement by Pope Francis comes after he broke with centuries of Christian tradition earlier this year, telling a crowd of 33,000 Catholics in Rome that \u201ca personal, direct, immediate relationship with Jesus Christ\u201d must be avoided at all costs.\n\n\u201cHaving a personal relationship with Jesus is dangerous and very harmful,\u201d the pope said during the June 25 speech.\n\nThe unconventional teachings of Pope Francis have caused Vatican Cardinals and senior priests to turn their back on the pontiff and refuse to pledge obedience to him.\n\nOPENLY CALLING FOR \u2018ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT\u2019\n\nIn July this year Pope Francis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the United States of America has \u201ca distorted vision of the world\u201d and Americans must be ruled by a world government, as soon as possible, \u201cfor their own good.\u201d\n\nThe week before he also called for \u201ca one world government\u201d and \u201cpolitical authority\u201d, arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat major issues such as \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Ecuador\u2019s El Universo newspaper, the Pope said that the United Nations doesnt have enough power and must be granted full governmental control \u201cfor the good of humanity.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s Marine Le Pen described Pope Francis as a \u201cglobalist bulldog\u201c. Vladimir Putin argued that Francis\u2019s unconventional teachings disqualified the Pope from calling himself a man of God. Francis\u2019s own Cardinals are in open revolt against him, telling anybody who will listen that he was installed in unusual circumstances, with the assistance of globalist powerbrokers like George Soros.\n\nPope Francis\u2019s anti-Christian teachings are forcing Christians around the world to confront the difficult question \u2013 is he the false prophet that will precede the antichrist foretold in holy scripture?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171120042453im_/http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shocked-CNN-80x60.png",
