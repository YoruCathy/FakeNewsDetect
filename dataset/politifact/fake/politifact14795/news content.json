A neighbor supposedly an assistant of an Imam of a mosque close by has reported this to Saudi Arabia's religious police. When the police arrived the girls were dancing with their male friends and they were arrested immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultra conservative Arabian nation that has one of the worst human rights records is also a member of the United Nations Human Rights commission and recently got elected to the Women's Rights Commission as well which sparked anger and protest.\n\nAccording to HRW the girls were detained for more than a year before the trial and never confessed committing any crime. However the verdict of the \"male only\" Sharia panel was that they need o be executed in accordance with the Sharia law. The boys were only advised \"not to be victimized\" the report further states.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaudi uses methods such as beheading, stoning and crucifixion to execute women for crimes, including adultery, in the strict Islamic country. Beheadings take place in public squares where the headless corpses are later put on display.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://img1.blogblog.com/img/icon18_email.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_q_tPm93ZwSI/S6a2uyGYm2I/AAAAAAAAAH4/fu3kLYEG9uc/S45-s35/joanna.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4NdUeQ6BD8Y/WMGJARJG_lI/AAAAAAAAB94/zKGajaZmqTwAVthKMrfKQ6s5SYTgmyidQCK4B/s35/me.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OMA268-0DsI/Vass81sejdI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/TthR1W5KSoo/s35/me.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?3238547&101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-A3yRqLsV5Fo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABSE/X8pgOlQEyk0/s35-c/photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/https://resources.blogblog.com/img/icon18_wrench_allbkg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://images.dmca.com/Badges/dmca_protected_sml_120l.png?ID=dd0f16be-ffc2-49bc-9fd4-645f237ed79a", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sde9XSQwDSk/We6PuokyNxI/AAAAAAAAD5Q/vjlhGk7lUvQfqEirZ0eHj8oZE0GslFvRACLcBGAs/s72-c/saudi%2Bwomen%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bbeheaded%2Bfor%2Bindecency.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kmcCrZCJkkc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAG8/bEGptk8Qo-0/s35-c/photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nGxaJdM8Hs4/SoGbmBfecNI/AAAAAAAAABY/jaUhRxEkHdg/S45-s35/DSC00805.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LOPy4nzxozQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANHM/Ti9WeFqmhPQ/s35-c/photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-VQvDvLNHvaw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/xjNYnUh7up4/s35-c/photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_GTTOk2J1iU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/JXcj_Ugocd8/s35-c/photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d5nIaPkCJn8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACI/NXc8G1QAWLI/s35-c/photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sde9XSQwDSk/We6PuokyNxI/AAAAAAAAD5Q/vjlhGk7lUvQfqEirZ0eHj8oZE0GslFvRACLcBGAs/s1600/saudi%2Bwomen%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bbeheaded%2Bfor%2Bindecency.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sde9XSQwDSk/We6PuokyNxI/AAAAAAAAD5Q/vjlhGk7lUvQfqEirZ0eHj8oZE0GslFvRACLcBGAs/s72-c/saudi%2Bwomen%2Bto%2Bbe%2Bbeheaded%2Bfor%2Bindecency.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Prof. Van Heizen"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356/http://www.religionmind.com/2017/10/saudi-arabia-behead-6-school-girls-for.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "Rm17anHEHXOuooRk_EgY_mJVXgV06v_1PtESv3Ww9lE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "keyword": "Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian", "geo.country": "ID", "geo.placename": "Canada", "generator": "blogger", "googlebot": "index, follow", "author": "Prof. Van Heizen", "rating": "general", "og": {"site_name": "RELIGION MIND", "title": "Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027105356/http://www.religionmind.com/2017/10/saudi-arabia-behead-6-school-girls-for.html", "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "id_ID"}}, "fb": {"admins": "YOUR-FACEBOOK-USER-ID", "app_id": 730403660403874}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
