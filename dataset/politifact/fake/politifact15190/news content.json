So when Hogg heard a \u201cpop\u201d while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a \u201cCode Red\u201d exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.\n\nAnd then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor\u2014Hogg doesn\u2019t know his name but calls him an angel\u2014knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg\u2014who\u2019s an editor at the school\u2019s TV station\u2014found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.\n\nThe shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.\n\n\u201cWhile I was in there, I thought, \u2018What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?\u2019\u201d Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. \u201cAnd the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that\u2019s all I could think: Get other people\u2019s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that\u2019s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. It\u2019s being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And it\u2019s becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next.\n\n\u201cWhen do we say, that\u2019s not acceptable, something has to change?\u201d asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking.\n\nHogg\u2019s sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action\n\nWill Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunman\u2019s wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that haven\u2019t been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasn\u2019t real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teacher\u2019s orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour.\n\n\u201cIt was hot in there. We were packed in tight,\u201d he told TIME. \u201cSome students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves.\u201d Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd.\n\n\u201cMy husband is ex-military, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re anti-gun. But an AR-15?\u201d Kristi Gilroy said. \u201cYou tell me, how big of a gun does a person need?\u201d Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children she\u2019d taught when they were younger.\n\nThe usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. \u201cNow, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country,\u201d Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. \u201cOur students are asking for that.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals.\n\n\u201cTo every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that she\u2019d been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. \u201cHaving to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career,\u201d she said, her eyes full of tears.\n\nTo some, however, words of comfort won\u2019t be enough. \u201cWhen do we actually stand up? I think it\u2019s the time that we all stand up,\u201d Hogg demanded. \u201cIf you don\u2019t call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, it\u2019s going to be your child that\u2019s next. And that\u2019s horrifying.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that it\u2019s okay to go back to school, that they\u2019re safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.\n\nGet The Brief.
