In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.\n\nThe men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.\n\nNow, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster \u2014 which is \u201cillegal\u201d in California \u2014 and put both men down in seconds.\n\nProsecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was \u201cextreme and unnecessary.\u201d The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:\n\n\u201cMr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men\u2019s initial wounds were superficial.\n\nWhile they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn\u2019t \u2018denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.\n\nHallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn\u2019t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.\u201d\n\nReligious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he\u2019d get a medal from the Governor of California?\n\nDeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don\u2019t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a \u201csmall price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.\u201d\n\nDeLisle hasn\u2019t asked for an appeal.\n\nSource: Ladies of Liberty", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/01-136.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/crosby-sidney.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/01-136-450x248.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Yoel-Romero-Anderson-Silva-450x270.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/82-678x381.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/logo-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tupac-450x270.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/footer-logo-2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hi-res-a590186fd4d3b5a6ee07c44b593569a8_crop_north.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hi-res-a590186fd4d3b5a6ee07c44b593569a8_crop_north-450x270.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Yoel-Romero-Anderson-Silva.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ead3cc8bd29c7757447b84acc671d912?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tupac.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/crosby-sidney-450x270.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/82-678x381.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Patriot"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/82-year-old-who-killed-a-muslim-in-self-defense-gets-the-death-penalty/", "title": "82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 121928398436982}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013854im_/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/82-678x381.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation.
