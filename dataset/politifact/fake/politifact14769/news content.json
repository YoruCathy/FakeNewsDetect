Seroussi\u2019s study showed a mantle plume pushes 150 milliwatts per square meter of heat up towards the ice sheet. That\u2019s about two to three times the heat flux of regions of the world without volcanic activity.\n\nA 2014 University of Texas study found western Antarctica was a literal hotbed for geothermal heat. Researchers concluded that \u201clarge areas at the base of Thwaites Glacier are actively melting in response to geothermal flux consistent with rift-associated magma migration and volcanism.\u201d\n\nThe following year, a team of U.S. scientists confirmed in a study, the large amount of geothermal heat beneath the ice sheet, \u201cThe high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region,\u201d the study found.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-214-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-215-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-215-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-212-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-211-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-213-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-213-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-214-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-212-100x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/unnamed-211-255x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/amnewslogo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52-730x429.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//web.archive.org/web/20171228123849/http://americannews.com/busted-nasa-accidentally-destroys-every-climate-change-advocate-exposing-massive-truth-behind-antartica/", "title": "BUSTED: NASA Accidentally Destroys Every Climate Change Advocate By Exposing Massive Truth Behind Antartica", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "According to a new study by NASA,\u00a0Ancient underground streams of heated rock, called a mantle plume, might be an explanation for the instability of Antarctica\u2019s western ice sheet, which is...", "title": "BUSTED: NASA Accidentally Destroys Every Climate Change Advocate By Exposing Massive Truth Behind Antartica - American News", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52.jpg"}, "referrer": "always", "og": {"site_name": "American News", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849/http://americannews.com/busted-nasa-accidentally-destroys-every-climate-change-advocate-exposing-massive-truth-behind-antartica/", "title": "BUSTED: NASA Accidentally Destroys Every Climate Change Advocate By Exposing Massive Truth Behind Antartica - American News", "description": "According to a new study by NASA,\u00a0Ancient underground streams of heated rock, called a mantle plume, might be an explanation for the instability of Antarctica\u2019s western ice sheet, which is...", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171228123849im_/http://americannews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/unnamed-52.jpg", "width": 785, "height": 429}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1593609767543621}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-08T17:55:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-08T17:55:37+00:00", "author": "http://americannews.com/author/kevin/", "section": "NEWS"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510163737.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
