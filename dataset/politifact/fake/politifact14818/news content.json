Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.\n\n\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s decision to approve Rosatom\u2019s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\n\nThe Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.\n\nBut FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee\u2019s decision that Vadim Mikerin \u2014 the main Russian overseeing Putin\u2019s nuclear expansion inside the United States \u2014 was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.\n\nThen-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderBe wary of voting by mail initiatives Biden hosts potential VP pick Gretchen Whitmer on podcast The Hill's Campaign Report: Coronavirus forces Democrats to postpone convention MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.\n\nSpokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn\u2019t comment.\n\nMikerin was a director of Rosatom\u2019s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom\u2019s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom\u2019s new American arm called Tenam.\n\nBetween 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin \u201cdid knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons \u2026 to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,\u201d a November 2014 indictment stated.\n\nHis illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin\u2019s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.\n\nIn evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a \u201cracketeering scheme\u201d that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.\n\n\u201cAs part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,\u201d Agent David Gadren testified.\n\n\u201cMikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,\u201d the agent added.\n\nThe investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinSessions: No regrets about leaving Senate to serve as attorney general COVID-19 is no excuse for Attorney General Barr to skirt the rule of law Full appeals court to rehear case over McGahn subpoena MORE, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpMichael Cohen to be released early from prison amid coronavirus pandemic: report Biden assembling White House transition team Top Republicans call on Trump to fund WHO pending director-general's resignation MORE\u2019s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeAG Barr just signaled that things are about to get ugly for the Russia collusion team Federal officials fired by Trump face tough road in court Trump shakes up Justice Department, intelligence community MORE, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.\n\nBoth men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife\u2019s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.\n\nIts many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.\n\nThe case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia\u2019s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.\n\nOne of Mikerin\u2019s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to \u201callow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,\u201d agents testified in one court filing.\n\nBringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency\u2019s cap.\n\nBut the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.\n\nThe only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.\n\nBy that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\u2019s approval.\n\nThe final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia\u2019s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.\n\nThe lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, \u201ca former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison\u201d and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.\n\nRonald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin\u2019s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.\n\n\u201cI had no idea this case was being conducted,\u201d a surprised Hosko said in an interview.\n\nLikewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.\n\nFormer Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersFreshman Dem finds voice in fight against online extremism Lawmakers criticize Trump's slashed budget for key federal cyber agency GOP lobbyist tapped for White House legislative affairs MORE (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration\u2019s approval of the Uranium One deal.\n\n\u201cNot providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated at 6:50
