I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.\n\nSo then the one guy finds out that I\u2019m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cSure, what the hell.\u201d So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester \u2013 some place called Wild Willy\u2019s \u2013 and get a burger. Great freakin\u2019 burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.\n\nI\u2019m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I\u2019m gonna move there after I retire, \u201d Murray said with a laugh.\n\nMurray added later, \u201cYou have to understand, this is something that would\u2019ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that\u2019s my story about Rochester. It\u2019s nice to know there are still places like this in America.\u201d\n\nphoto by David Shankbone / CC BY 2.0 / cropped", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161226221619im_/http://newsdaily12.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bill-Murray.jpg"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161226221619/http://newsdaily12.com/rochester-new-hampshire/bill-murray-had-this-to-say-about-rochester-new-hampshire-residents/", "title": "Bill Murray Had This to Say About Rochester, New Hampshire Residents \u2013 News Daily 12", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.7"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
