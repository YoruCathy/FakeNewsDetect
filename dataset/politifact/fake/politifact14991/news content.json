Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20106843087951-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/Joe-Biden-3-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Wuhan-Virology-Lab-200x133.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/GettyImages-1204091992-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/israel-virus-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/healthcare-workers-coronavirus-testing-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20072665032149-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Trump-on-Reopening-America-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Recall-Whitmer-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/beijing-laboratory-getty-images-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Screen-Shot-1-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Gov.-Whitmer-coronavirus-update-032020-27-1-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/coronavirus-testing-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/GettyImages-1219040747-e1587039822252-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20070716685684-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_19316687408780-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Guidance-for-Opening-Up-America-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/48012530193_fe43c9037e_o-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/social-distancing-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/wi/afp/30/2b0027_chinese-president-xi-jinping-centre-talks-facebook-chief-executive-mark-e1537998168298-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/George-Soros-200x150.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Gavin-Newsoms-Giveaway-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
