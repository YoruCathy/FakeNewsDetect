And we know our audience of narrow-minded, unsophisticated bumpkins will welcome her just as enthusiastically.\u201d\n\nIn her vulgar post, Ms. Barr wrote that Valerie Jarrett, an African-American adviser to President Barack Obama, was the offspring of the \u201cmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.\u201d The abhorrent tweet met with immediate condemnation on social media from all moderate voices, but cheers among Fox\u2019s white supremacist fans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who had called Ms. Barr earlier in the year to congratulate her on the success of her show, and who uses Fox programming to promote his administration\u2019s policies, was thrilled to hear that \u201cRoseanne\u201d would be coming to his favorite network.\n\n\u201cBig news for \u2018Roseanne\u2019 fans and everyone who enjoys \u2018black\u2019 humor,\u201d tweeted the president on Tuesday night. \u201cI know that all Ms. Barr wants to do is make America great again and kudos to Fox for keeping that hope alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne\u201d will air on Monday nights at 8:00pm on the Fox Network starting in September.\n\nH/T: Extra News Feed", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GI-Barack-Obama-vs-GETTY-Iranian-President-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/plugins/report-content/static/img/loading.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1527011154797-300x180.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/potus-press-logo-2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1A-2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/RTS1RS87-e1526503919230-80x80.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GI-Barack-Obama-vs-GETTY-Iranian-President-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1527011154797-80x80.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/KimmelDefendsMoralConscience-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/KimmelDefendsMoralConscience-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Nancyoutoftouch1-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1A-2-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Nancyoutoftouch1-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1A-2-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/RTS1RS87-e1526503919230-300x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1A-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "FOX Network Picks Up \u2018Roseanne,\u2019 Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism \u2013 The Newly Press News Network \u2013 POTUS Press Network", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180531145141im_/http://potus-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1A-2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After ABC cancels Roseanne Barr\u2019s hit show in response to her stunning racist tweet, the network of bigots comes to the\u00a0rescue.
