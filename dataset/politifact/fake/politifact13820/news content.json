He also thanked Terrance \u2018Scooby\u2019 Williams of Dr. Green\u2019s Greenery, a pot dispensary in Oakland, CA, for helping him find the right strain of cannabis.\n\nCarter told his medicinal regiment to Sawyer\u201cI smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.\n\n\u201cEdibles are also good when traveling when smoking is not permitted.\u201d\n\nThe future is bright for the 91-year-old humanitarian. Carter has resumed his house building for Habitat for Humanity and continues his weekly prayer service. \u201cMarijuana is God\u2019s medicine. I find indica is better than sativa, but there are plenty of good hybrids.\u201c\n\nCarter wasn\u2019t endorsing pot smoking for everyone. \u201cThere is the right place and the right time to spark up a bowl. Don\u2019t be a pothead but also be aware of the potential benefits of cannabis when used in moderation with the right music.\n\n\u201cI was never of big fan of alcohol but weed is the medicine I need. It also revived my love for peanuts. Have you ever eaten a peanut\u2026 on weed?\u201d\n\nWith legal weed available in Colorado and Washington State and several states likely to pass the legalization next November during the Presidential elections, Carter will help support the cause in California, Oregon, and Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cHelp build a house for those that need one and peace and sex above all else. I forget, what were we talking about?\u201d\n\n[Satire]", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a93947faa2038180dc9f5642419aa723?s=140&r=g", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/whic-cbd-is-best-300x250.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-eAWQdLrEHhwPM.gif", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a93947faa2038180dc9f5642419aa723?s=180&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b7b05ffe88b8c7c46075baba5fe310d0?s=70&r=g", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10JUDGE1-master768-390x220.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a2d2eceec0a9bf406610e608e592532?s=70&r=g", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/soundcloud-logo-300x171.png", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nba-390x220.png", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/is-cannabis-and-covid-19-a-good-combination-sick-bud-390x220.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/melissa_etheridge_150387359-390x220.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/culture-national-marijuana-news.png", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5666f5ef7d162d06ca90188d.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TXFlag-390x220.png", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/685ca56acb7b27e9040fee1766bccac0xxl-390x220.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot_022416_102303_AM.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/47a06335325b6833a4dc4b336410b5b0?s=70&r=g", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20-390x220.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/104175698-GettyImages-518242830.1910x1000-390x220.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c991cfbd507cd5b52a693383e241fde1?s=70&r=g", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/How-to-Pass-a-Mouth-Swab-Drug-Test-swab-390x220.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Please_do_not_arrest_cannabis_patients-390x220.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e2df51a3209baeb10d5499712a202d2d?s=70&r=g", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Acreage-Holdings-Directors-Weld-Boehner-390x220.jpg", "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Nevada-Dispensaries-Move-to-Delivery-Only-Amid-COVID-19-Outbreak-sign-390x220.jpg"], "top_img": "https://thenationalmarijuananews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5666f5ef7d162d06ca90188d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Richard Lowe", "Richard Lowe Is A Veteran Of The Financial Sector With Licenses As A Commodity Broker", "Series", "Investment Advisor Representative", "Iar Series .
