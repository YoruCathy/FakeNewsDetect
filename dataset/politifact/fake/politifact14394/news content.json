It almost seems fitting that the last thing she hears is a lie about her own well-being.\n\nThe Butcher of Benghazi will meet her maker, says Doctor Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as the damage to her heart is irreparable at this point:\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton fought hard but today her fight is over. We predict she\u2019ll be at rest within hours.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton family has asked for privacy and wouldn\u2019t answer questions about whether or not they had to decide to \u201cpull the plug\u201d or if they\u2019re simply being told nothing can be done. Chelsea Clinton was seen entering the hospital in tears shortly after noon, according to a new report from LLOD correspondent Skip Tetheluda:\n\n\u201cChelsea came alone and was obviously distraught. She made no comment to the press but did stop to tell one photographer to have some respect while she \u2018visits a great woman for the last time.\u2019 She hasn\u2019t come out and is presumably sitting and waiting to say goodbye. Bill Clinton is sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll update you as soon as we confirm that Clinton has gone on to answer for her crimes with an eternity in Hell.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-inauguration-7-300x180.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/121-300x180.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/121-80x80.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maxresdefault-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/67-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Schermata-2017-04-01-alle-17.45.45-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/linds-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muslims-80x80.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/POL2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/miley-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-kids-ad-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Schermata-2017-04-01-alle-17.45.45-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/67-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/111-80x80.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-inauguration-7-80x80.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag/images/logos/logo-foot.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maxresdefault-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/miley-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/57.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/schumer-1480760688-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/trump-kids-ad-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/muslims-300x180.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/linds-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spicer-hillary-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spicer-hillary-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/111-300x180.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/schumer-1480760688-300x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/57.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757/http://politicspaper.com/breaking/breaking-hillary-clinton-third-heart-attack-docs-says-wont-survive/", "title": "BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Has Third Heart Attack-Docs Says She \u2018Won\u2019t Survive\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170731052757im_/http://politicspaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/57.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hillary Clinton had a third and most-likely fatal heart attack this afternoon after spending the morning being told she\u2019d be getting better.
