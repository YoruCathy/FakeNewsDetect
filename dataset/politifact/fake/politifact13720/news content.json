Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.\n\nTrump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Ghana.\n\nHowever, Ghanaians who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 the seven Muslim-majority countries \u201cof concern\u201d.\n\nIt has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Ghanaian Diplomats in the States.\n\nA source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australia\u2019s opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.\n\nAllowing Ghanaians to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office.
