In the real image, Gonz\u00e1lez is ripping apart a gun-range target.\n\nThe doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.\n\nAD\n\nThe animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.\n\nHe tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading \u201c#Vorw\u00e4rts!\u201d \u2014 the German word for \u201cforward\u201d and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.\n\nAD\n\nGab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was \u201csatire.\u201d It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.\n\nAD\n\nThe pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.\n\nDonald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: \u201cJust a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),\u201d referencing a user named \u201cLinda NRA Supporter\u201d who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.\n\nAD\n\nJusty a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018\n\nMoynihan\u2019s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.\n\nAD\n\nGenerally, one form of criticism of Gonz\u00e1lez and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.\n\nThey are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right\u2019s criticism of Hogg\u2019s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.\n\nThe online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first \u201ctop news\u201d video that appears in a YouTube search for \u201cDavid Hogg\u201d is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not just go after this kid,\u201d host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.\n\nAD\n\nOther elements of Gonz\u00e1lez have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.\n\nAD\n\nFor instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.\n\n\u201cEmma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,\u201d one meme shared on Reddit\u2019s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).\n\n\u201cThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don\u2019t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,\u201d said a post on King\u2019s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of Gonz\u00e1lez at the podium Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics \u2014 a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.\n\n\u201cThe initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it\u2019s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. \u2018Boycott this, boycott that.\u2019 It\u2019s detracting from the actual discussions,\u201d Kashuv told The Post\u2019s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.\n\nSince then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.\n\nHogg\u2019s comments at the rally were \u201cegregious and inflammatory,\u201d Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg\u2019s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.\n\nConservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?\u201d Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nAbby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ztURgwlPSHjuPm2tBDef5ape2TY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SMXCSWGQQZFVPFSAGPJEDHUC4.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/72f3d4da-482a-43b3-a5d7-2a8a93819de7.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ztURgwlPSHjuPm2tBDef5ape2TY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SMXCSWGQQZFVPFSAGPJEDHUC4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/03/25/a-fake-photo-of-emma-gonzalez-went-viral-on-the-far-right-where-parkland-teens-are-villains/", "title": "A fake photo of Emma Gonz\u00e1lez went viral on the far right, where Parkland teens are villains", "meta_data": {"description": "The reaction to the March for Our Lives is exposing the starkly different ways the nation sees the Parkland students.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/03/25/a-fake-photo-of-emma-gonzalez-went-viral-on-the-far-right-where-parkland-teens-are-villains/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ztURgwlPSHjuPm2tBDef5ape2TY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SMXCSWGQQZFVPFSAGPJEDHUC4.jpg", "title": "A fake photo of Emma Gonz\u00e1lez went viral on the far right, where Parkland teens are villains", "description": "The reaction to the March for Our Lives is exposing the starkly different ways the nation sees the Parkland students."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A fake photo of Emma Gonz\u00e1lez went viral on the far right, where Parkland teens are villains", "description": "The reaction to the March for Our Lives is exposing the starkly different ways the nation sees the Parkland students."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-28T18:14:41.790Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521907200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
