During a Fox News discussion about the recent United Airlines public relations debacle, Smith noted that lawmakers were calling for an investigation and that the airline lost millions in stock value. \u201cAirlines disgust me,\u201d Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera told Smith. \u201cThey do everything to maximize profit.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with maximizing profit,\u201d Smith insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do as a publicly traded airline.\u201d \u201cBut when you book and overbook,\u201d Rivera replied, \u201cpaid passengers have to give up their seats. This is not business. This is reckless, foolhardy imposition of your own personal convenience \u2013 what happened to \u2018the customer is always right\u2019?\u201d\n\nSmith continued, \u201cBut look, I get where you\u2019re coming from with this, but at the end of the day, we\u2019re talking here about an airline, a company that exists solely for the purpose of transporting passengers from one place in the country to another. If you just consider the fact that 15 or so years ago we had two airplanes crash into the World Trade Center in New York City, I think you\u2019ll understand that they were right to be edgy. And that goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American. As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, it\u2019s obvious that his behavior suggests that he\u2019s from another part of the world, and that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nRivera asked, \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly be serious, Sandra? Are you actually saying that the company was right to, first, overbook the flight, and then secondly, call security to beat up the man simple because his behavior suggested he wasn\u2019t a true American? And what does that even mean?\u201d Again, Smith wouldn\u2019t be confused. \u201cLook Geraldo, at the end of the day, you have to understand the fact that the moment Americans see a non-white person sitting next to them on a plane, they get chills. Some of them get outright angry as well, and while that\u2019s not ideal, it\u2019s certainly understandable. We can\u2019t blame people for fearing for their lives because of the terrible tragedy this country endured during 9/11.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, I would even go so far as to say that the man had it coming for one simple reason. If that had been a white person, they would have likely stepped out of the plane and waited for the next flight, not to mention that they would probably also have been compensated for the inconvenience in some way or another. Instead, since this guy wasn\u2019t white, his reaction was also different from that of a white person, which is why he refused to give up his seat. If he\u2019d done that, everything would have gone more smoothly and without incident. This way, because he was stubborn, he ended up getting the short end of the stick. That\u2019s just not how white people behave, and non-whites in this country need to learn that. We\u2019re more civilized than the rest, which is why we\u2019re at the top of the food chain. The guy had it coming, end of story,\u201d she concluded.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sean-Spicer-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sean-Spicer.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith-640x325.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744im_/http://politicass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sandra-smith.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Stevan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170416181744/http://politicass.com/fox-news-sandra-smith-everybody-see-united-airlines-passengers-behavior-not-genuine-american/", "title": "Fox News Sandra Smith: \u201cEverybody Could See From The United Airlines Passenger\u2019s Behavior That He Was Not A Genuine American\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fox News Sandra Smith: \u201cEverybody Could See From The United Airlines Passenger\u2019s Behavior That He Was Not A Genuine American\u201d", "description": "Fox News host Sandra Smith on Wednesday linked a customer who was dragged off a United Airlines flight to government \u201coverregulation\u201d of the airline industry.
