Sadly, it might just happen.\n\nThe latest news from sources is that Prince William is in the middle of a huge predicament, one that could change relationships.\n\nPrince William has to choose to either go to Prince Harry's wedding and stand by his side as the best man or choose to attend a soccer game.\n\nWhile for most of us it seems like an easy choice. Family over soccer. However, for Prince William, it won't be so easy.\n\nSaturday is not just the big Royal wedding; it's also England's Football Association Cup final against Manchester United and Chelsea. He is expected to be there.\n\nKnowing what we know about Prince William, he would rather be at the wedding than at a soccer game. However, it's not just a soccer game and he's not just a spectator, he's the FA president. He has been for over a decade.\n\nEach and every year, the FA president is expected to be in attendance at the final game at Wembley Stadium. The president's job is also to award the final cup trophy to the winning team.\n\nThis long-standing tradition and a popular England sporting event will be a hard one for Prince William to miss.\n\nWhile this quandary isn't unexpected news to Prince William, he's been thinking about it for months. In an interview with radio broadcaster Rio Ferdinand in January, he expressed his upcoming dilemma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision, are we going to Wembley, or are we going to...?\u201d William asking Rio. \u201cYou\u2019ve touched on something there, Rio, yeah. I\u2019m still working it out. I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d\n\nEven though both events are happening the same day, he may be able to attend both. The wedding is at noon, and the soccer game is at 5:30 p.m.\n\nBeing 20 miles apart from each other, he could attend the reception at St. George's Chapel and take his helicopter to Wembley to present the trophy. After that, he could travel back to the evening reception at the Frogmore House.\n\nThere is no final word yet as to what Prince William will do. Let's hope he can pull it off!\n\nDo you think he can?
