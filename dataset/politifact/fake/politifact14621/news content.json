businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a \u201cnon-profit.\u201d The NFL is one of those businesses \u2013 or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league\u2019s non-profit status.\n\nThe order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.\n\nTo date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump \u201ctemporarily\u201d revoked their 401(c)(3) status \u201cuntil it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.\u201d\n\nThe NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 \u201cif all of the problems are solved.\u201d\n\nThe White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the \u201cathletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate\u201d fired and replaced with people who \u201clove and respect America.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has thus far refused comment.", "images":
