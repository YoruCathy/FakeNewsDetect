Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here\u2019s what WJ just reported:\n\n\u201cThe staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the \u2018Questionnaire for National Security Positions.\u2019 The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant\u2019s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.\u201d\n\nThe six staffers included the daughter of President Trump\u2019s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:\n\n\u201cWiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.\u201d\n\nThe form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.\n\nIt\u2019s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:\n\n\u201cDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be \u2018their most sacred obligation.\u2019 Schiff added, referring to Trump: \u2018I\u2019m sure there are people in the community who feel they don\u2019t know where he\u2019s coming from on Russia.'\u201d\n\nJust as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.\n\nFeatured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://info.nct.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-632870224.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://info.nct.news/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nctlogo-2.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://info.nct.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-632870224.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621/http://info.nct.news/2017/12/30/breaking-fbi-just-raided-the-white-house-high-ranking-officials-thrown-out/", "title": "BREAKING: FBI Just Raided The White House, 6 People Thrown Out", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 1295417710486771, "pages": 1672814509645693, "op-recirculation-ads": "placement_id=349167352220154_352543025215920"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: FBI Just Raided The White House, 6 People Thrown Out", "site_name": "New Century Times", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://info.nct.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-632870224.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "description": "His administration is falling."}, "twitter": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://info.nct.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-632870224.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "BREAKING: FBI Just Raided The White House, 6 People Thrown Out", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180102041621im_/http://info.nct.news/2017/12/30/breaking-fbi-just-raided-the-white-house-high-ranking-officials-thrown-out/", "description": "His administration is falling.", "site": "@newcenturytimes"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.1", "ia": {"markup_url": "http://info.nct.news/2017/12/30/breaking-fbi-just-raided-the-white-house-high-ranking-officials-thrown-out/?ia_markup=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514563200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
