They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Mar\n\nin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.\n\nPolice reports revealed that Heidgen\u2019s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.\n\nThe driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride\u2019s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.\n\nDespite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.\n\nThen, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness \u2013 her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.\n\nOne of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride\u2019s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:\n\n\u201cI was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t go back there. It\u2019s bad,\u2019\u201d Michael Tangney said. \u201cI opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.\u201d\n\nBut, tragically, the worst was yet to come.\n\nMichael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter\u2019s head in her hands. Katie\u2019s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.\n\nFor the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie\u2019s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.\n\nEventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter\u2019s face one last time.\n\nThe event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder \u2013 though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer\u2019s daughter.\n\nJennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.\n\n\u201cSince no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,\u201d Jennifer said.\n\n\u201cI hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.\u201d\n\nThe fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen your fair share of stories on the news and watched it happen in movies. Some people, unfortunately, have even had to experience it first-hand, just like Jennifer and her family.\n\nPlease share this story to remind any and all that alcohol and driving are a combination that never belong together. Hopefully, by doing so, we can prevent acts like tragedy occurring in the future.", "images":
