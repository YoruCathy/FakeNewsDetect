Arpaio, convicted of a bogus charge for doing the job the people of Maricopa County elected him to do, was about to spend the next 12 to 18 months in a federal minimum security prison.\n\nHis second pardon of the day, while not as immediately necessary, held just as much meaning. By granting clemency to Kim Davis, the Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, her record will be expunged and her good name reinstated. Davis has been seeing a probation officer monthly since the incident nearly two years ago now to prove she\u2019s in compliance with the judge\u2019s orders.\n\nWith her record cleared, she no longer has to check in with anyone or list herself on job, volunteer and credit applications as a criminal. A criminal is the farthest thing from what she is. She\u2019s a conscientious freedom fighter who wouldn\u2019t stand by while her rights were trampled and her very existence threatened.\n\nShe\u2019s the perfect candidate for a Trump pardon, and that\u2019s exactly what she got. Davis is expected to return to her job in the Clerk\u2019s office where she can now refuse to issue marriage licences to gays and not worry about it becoming a \u201cnational scandal.\u201d Davis said, \u201cI told them all along I didn\u2019t care if they went to the county down the street. Just not in my building. Not while my God still relies on me to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nGod Bless you, Kim Davis. You\u2019re a real piece of work.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/http://ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cropped-lotf-site-header.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i2.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-davis.jpg?resize=678%2C381", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i2.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-davis.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg?fit=146%2C212", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i0.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/thesharpandthedead.jpg?resize=80%2C60", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i1.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weblurredthefaceonanoldphotolol.jpg?resize=80%2C60"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170828162320im_/https://i2.wp.com/ourlandofthefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-davis.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About Flagg Eagleton", "Flagg Eagleton Is The Son Of An American Potato Farmer", "A Patriot.
