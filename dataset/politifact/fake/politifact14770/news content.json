General George Mason\u2019s assistant Chief of Staff all but confirmed the report, saying that the matter has been turned over to those in charge of accountability. She hinted that this is exactly the kind of thing that could end up before Congress:\n\n\u201cThis was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the US taxpayer. Sourcres say the Taliban paid nearly a dollar a round. Someone in Obama\u2019s circle pocketed that money.\u201d\n\nNews Feed Observer\u2019s correspondent Skip Tetheluda contacted Congressman Trey Gowdy\u2019s office, who would not confirm or deny any of the allegations. Angela Corning, Gowdy\u2019s publicist, says the Congressman would certainly be eager to look into the details if this pans out, which is looking pretty good right about now.\n\nThe ammo went missing in early spring, 2010, while Hillary Clinton was still Secretary of State. The issue was handled as an \u201cinventory discrepancy\u201d and swept under the rug. Well\u2026that rug has been lifted and what\u2019s underneath is just\u2026filthy.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171223051230im_/http://newsfeedobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-are-you-so-stupid..jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223051230im_/http://newsfeedobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-are-you-so-stupid..jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223051230/http://newsfeedobserver.com/2-million-rounds-of-ammo-that-went-missing-under-obama-turns-up-in-enemy-hands/", "title": "BREAKING: 2 Million Rounds Of Ammo That \u2018Went Missing\u2019 Under Obama Turns Up In Enemy Hands", "meta_data": {"og": {"type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: 2 Million Rounds Of Ammo That \u2018Went Missing\u2019 Under Obama Turns Up In Enemy Hands", "description": "According to an insider report from the office of the Quartermaster at the Pentagon, the 2 million rounds of ammunition that \u201cwent missing\u201d during Obama\u2019s reign of terror were seized by US forces in Afghanistan", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223051230im_/http://newsfeedobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-are-you-so-stupid.-90x90.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223051230/http://newsfeedobserver.com/2-million-rounds-of-ammo-that-went-missing-under-obama-turns-up-in-enemy-hands/", "site_name": "News Feed Observer", "updated_time": "2017-11-09T17:44:18+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-09T17:36:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-09T17:44:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "BREAKING: 2 Million Rounds Of Ammo That \u2018Went Missing\u2019 Under Obama Turns Up In Enemy Hands", "description": "According to an insider report from the office of the Quartermaster at the Pentagon, the 2 million rounds of ammunition that \u201cwent missing\u201d during Obama\u2019s reign of terror were seized by US forces in Afghanistan", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223051230im_/http://newsfeedobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-are-you-so-stupid..jpg"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "ca_title": "BREAKING: 2 Million Rounds Of Ammo That \u2018Went Missing\u2019 Under Obama Turns Up In Enemy Hands", "ca_image": "http://newsfeedobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/why-are-you-so-stupid.-150x150.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510248996.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
