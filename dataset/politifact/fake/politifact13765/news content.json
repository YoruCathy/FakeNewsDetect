The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries.\n\nThe Senator stated that Australia is one of America\u2019s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia\u2019s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance.\n\nAccording to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who \u201cwithout permission of the United States\u201d either directly or indirectly \u201ccommences or carries on correspondence\u201d with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to \u201cinfluence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer\u201d in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years\u2013 or both.\n\nMcCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote.\n\nEven if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his \u201cunwavering support\u201d to the foreign leader.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Turnbull have denied any acrimony occurred during their phone call. Even if it had, that still does not mean that President Trump was not doing what he vowed to do, which is protecting America.\n\nTell us what you think about McCain action in the comments below.\n\nShare this post if you believe that President Trump will protect America!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McCain.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump-5-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ivanka-trump-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/matthew-m-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/matthew-m-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Conway-Clinton-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-1-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/donald-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philbin-Trump-80x80.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ivanka-trump-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump-5-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/donald-trump-1-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Conway-Clinton-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/donald-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Philbin-Trump-300x180.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thetrumpmedialogo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McCain.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836/http://thetrumpmedia.com/politics/mccain-blamed-sabotaging-trump/", "title": "McCain Blamed For Sabotaging Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170207153836im_/http://thetrumpmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McCain.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 467}, "type": "article", "description": "Senator John McCain should be supporting President Donald Trump and his Congressional peers in order to make America safe again but he obviously felt the need to go around the White House and call the", "title": "ALERT!
