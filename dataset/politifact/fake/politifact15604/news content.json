What type of heaven would you envisage if you were paid to stay in bed; it would be a glorious one wouldn\u2019t it? If only it were possible!!! But!! Hold it right there, don\u2019t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!\n\nYes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.\n\nMost of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.\n\nNASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their \u201cBed Rest Studies\u201d, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.\n\nIt does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.\n\nI would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I\u2019d had enough, I\u2019d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!\n\nAs long as they remain laying down. You\u2019re probably thinking what on earth is the point in this experiment.\n\nNASA want to study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel.\n\nNASA says the experiments is designed to achieve three things:\n\nUnderstanding how one\u2019s changing physiology in space may affect the process of certain missions.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of one\u2019s physiological state on their ability to perform in particular tasks.\n\nPreparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.\n\nThe experiment will consist of two categories.\n\nThe exercising group, are able to exercise using special tools that help them stay active while still lying down. While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.\n\nDuring the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.\n\nAs well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body\u2019s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/4-8.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6-9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/9-7.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/336ff7c1-da5a-4504-bc5f-3f484e3dd3ac_desktop-768x399.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/14-3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2-9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/og31.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/12-6.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/themes/awesome-base/images/logo-dark.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/3-8.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/themes/awesome-base/images/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/7-8.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/8-8.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5d9e9499-9e7d-482c-aec2-fd7e2e9a36d6_desktop.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/11-6.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/c50c6ecd-1859-476b-8aad-0d14cc017bfa_desktop.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/10-5.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/f5e216b9-4c10-4a07-8b79-db2aad8aca56_desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/15-2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/83c987f7-c1e0-462d-85e5-41321864d6f6_desktop-768x401.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/5-9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/861d187f-7969-4159-b02b-c97ce314ea16_desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/59e18149-67a4-4a7e-830d-369ee29ff178_desktop-768x401.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9cbc21ca-01a2-4d22-85ff-f11c60c3a813_desktop-768x401.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/24b61f4c-e3d1-4397-9fb8-4c7052cc4aec_desktop-768x401.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629im_/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/og31.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180713235629/http://www.worldfactsftw.com/nasa-will-pay-you/", "title": "NASA Will Pay You $100,000 To Stay In Bed For 60 Days!", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 242359762937460}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NASA Will Pay You $100,000 To Stay In Bed For 60 Days!", "description": "Wouldn\u2019t you just love to carry on sleeping on a Monday morning without having to submit to the Monday morning blues and get ready for work?
