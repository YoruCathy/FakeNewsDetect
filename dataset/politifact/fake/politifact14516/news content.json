According to news reports at the time, the mosque had raised more than $340,000 in cash and supplies \u201cfor the victims of Hurricane Harvey.\u201d All of that will now be sent overseas to Syria to \u201chelp\u201d people in refugee camps, which have been repeatedly identified as breeding grounds for ISIS recruitment.\n\n\u201cWe intended to send it to the people impacted by the hurricane,\u201d Alkalb said when asked if he lied about his intent when asking for donations from the community. \u201cBut after much prayer, Allah told us that we must help the people who need it most.\u201d\n\nResidents are outraged, demanding that Alkalb return their donations but he says he will not be doing that.\n\nIt\u2019s time for us to stop tolerating this stuff and make our voices heard!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170910192728im_/http://observeronline.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/misc.jpg",
