Now it\u2019s time for a Republican to take her seat.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180426092034im_/http://nrtonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Untitled-35-678x381.jpg"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": ["George Swenson"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180426092034/http://nrtonline.info/breaking-nancy-pelosi-to-resign-after-new-revelations/", "title": "BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi To Resign After New Revelations \u2013 NRTOnline", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.5", "fb": {"pages": 589219961239603}, "ia": {"markup_url": "http://nrtonline.info/breaking-nancy-pelosi-to-resign-after-new-revelations/?ia_markup=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
