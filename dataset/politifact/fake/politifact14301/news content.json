Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has \u201csanctioned\u201d violence, as long it protects the \u201cpeople favorable to the Obama position, politically.\u201d She insisted that the president is sending \u201ca signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don\u2019t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.\u201d She also linked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness\u201d to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving \u201cnormal\u201d people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\n\u201cAnd these days it has become so obvious that I\u2019m honestly surprised we\u2019re not having riots throughout the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen did this become a nation of criminals? I didn\u2019t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I\u2019m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.\u201d\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that \u201cnot even slaves\u201d suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. \u201cIt\u2019s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I\u2019m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear \u2013 we\u2019re supposed to be all evolved right now, we\u2019re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He\u2019s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you\u2019ve seen in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Bachmann continued firing, \u201cI don\u2019t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what\u2019s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d She added, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, during that time, we\u2019ve had the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve had countless terrorist attacks, we\u2019ve had many racial killings and crimes and we\u2019ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America\u2019s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I\u2019m guessing he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 I\u2019m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I\u2019d be saying the same thing all over again,\u201d Bachmann quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out \u2013 white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I\u2019m seriously worried whether or not we\u2019ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we\u2019re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we\u2019ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another \u2013 white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that\u2019s just one step away from extinction,\u201d Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/michelle-bachmann-645x325.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-07-at-6.53.36-PM-730x480-380x260.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Donald_Trump_Jr-696x464-1-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cop-1-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/paul-ryan-645x325-375x195.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Cop-1-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Buzz-Aldrin-645x325-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paul-ryan-645x325-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paul-ryan-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-07-at-6.53.36-PM-730x480-145x100.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-06-at-6.49.27-PM-730x480-375x195.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Donald_Trump_Jr-696x464-1-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_6827-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Buzz-Aldrin-645x325-145x100.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/michelle-bachmann-645x325.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041423/http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/", "title": "Bachmann: \u201cWhite People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bachmann: \u201cWhite People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery\u201d", "description": "On Sunday, ex-Rep.
