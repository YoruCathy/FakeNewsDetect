Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nPinterest\n\nAt approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper.\n\nCiting irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton.\n\nBill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillary\u2019s signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process.\n\nAccording to the filing obtained by CTN, the couple has a previously agreed-upon separation agreement or stipulation that will govern the manner in which the marital property is to be distributed in the event the divorce is finalized. It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers.\n\nCTN has censored the couple\u2019s address and the contact information for Hillary\u2019s attorney in the respect of their privacy.\n\nAt this time, the Clinton\u2019s are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clinton\u2019s got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard.\n\nThe couple\u2019s marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office.\n\nIt has been alleged in the past that the couple has a purely professional relationship and that they haven\u2019t slept in the same bed for years\n\nsource", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image-2-1024x576-660x330-125x125.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TRUMP_ARTS-85x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ftnclapper1116309330640x360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-22-at-1.31.41-PM-696x392-85x70.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/soros-125x125.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-10.44.52-AM-696x392-125x125.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/assange-hillary-obama-125x125.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hillary_wiki-85x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Obama-and-Trump.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hill2-125x125.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hillary-800x416.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1038012093-85x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/soros-evil-125x125.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/trump_98174645-696x392-125x125.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hillary.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hillary.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325/http://usanewstoday.org/index.php/2017/02/08/breaking-hilary-clinton-filed-divorce-new-york-courts/", "title": "BREAKING: Hilary Clinton Filed For Divorce In New York Courts!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: Hilary Clinton Filed For Divorce In New York Courts!", "description": "At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325/http://usanewstoday.org/index.php/2017/02/08/breaking-hilary-clinton-filed-divorce-new-york-courts/", "site_name": "USA NEWS TODAY", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170211071325im_/http://usanewstoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hillary.jpeg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usanewstodayorg-1609703969335293/", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2017-02-08T21:42:48+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Sharing is caring!FacebookTwitterGoogle+Pinterest At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper.
