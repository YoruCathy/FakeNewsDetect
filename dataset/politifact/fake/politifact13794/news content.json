You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.\n\nThe program, called \u201cTax Relief For Deserving Americans,\u201d will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:\n\nWhile deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being \u201creported\u201d by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus ion spending some money than the nonsense on the \u201cnews,\u201d and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.\n\nDemocrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don\u2019t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also don\u2019t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that much money in the grand scheme. We\u2019ll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe we\u2019ll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out. It\u2019s be taxable income, so 28 percent of it will come back anyway. It\u2019s not that big a deal. I\u2019ve built things, great things, huge things worth far more.\u201d\n\nOne thing is for sure. You can forget about all the stupidity the liberals are trying to sell you about lies and Russians and North Korea and all the rest of the humdrum day to day you shouldn\u2019t concern yourself with anyway. What a waste of time. Grab some cash and have some fun on your leader, Donald Trump!\n\nChecks will start arriving in the mail Friday.\n\nSource", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/https://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/radioalice.cbslocal.com20100704patriotic-pets-happy-birthday-usa.jpg?resize=500%2C375", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Rex-Obama.001-310x165.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/axqw-310x165.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2016-11-03-at-3.26.34-PM-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dcs-310x165.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/vfre-310x165.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cdasaAS-310x165.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cas-310x165.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/enVolve-julian-assange-obama-prison-wikileaks-696x392-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1454216424-img_4123-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Breaking_News11-660x330.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Breaking-news-310x165.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Breaking_News11-660x330.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139/http://usadailypost.us/2017/02/14/breaking-trump-just-gave-every-working-legal-man-woman-child-usa-612/", "title": "BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Every WORKING, LEGAL Man Woman And Child In The USA $612 EACH! -", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Every WORKING, LEGAL Man Woman And Child In The USA $612 EACH!", "type": "article", "description": "...", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139/http://usadailypost.us/2017/02/14/breaking-trump-just-gave-every-working-legal-man-woman-child-usa-612/", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217173139im_/http://usadailypost.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Breaking_News11.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "robots": "index,nofollow", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2017-02-14T22:04:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "If you\u2019re not a lazy bum on welfare or an illegal here to steal food stamps and free medicine, President Trump has some good news for you.
