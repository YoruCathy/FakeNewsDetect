To which he added that she\u2019s a great first lady but her life isn\u2019t simple.\n\nIt was a nice touch that the president mentioned the very first Lady since there\u2019s been so much scrutiny in their union lately. Especially since the porn star Stormy Daniel is obviously trying to take attention off Donald and Melania\u2019s strong marriage by placing it on her herself along with her sick affair asserts she has since recanted, but nevertheless won\u2019t quit speaking about.\n\nDaniels is making Melania look bad and the first woman is getting revenge by never giving into her attention-seeking ways with any reaction or attack, which the pornography celebrity probably wants considering she\u2019s probably doing all of this for monetary gain and a wonderful book deal.\n\nAfter all, it has to be hard being a washed-up porn star that will never be as well respected, well known, well liked and rich since Melania is.\n\nMelania is keeping her class and elegance before the world in a very rough time. While at precisely the same time also showing she\u2019s human and relatable by recognizing lifestyle is \u201cnot so simple.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a fact and leaves her relatable to us ordinary folk, it is not weakness, so it may very well be her greatest strength and the reason a lot people adore and respect her. Not sure you\u2019ll be able to find 1 person who admires and would like to become Stormy Daniels.\n\nStormy, go crawl back into the cave you came out, no one here is interested in the accusations you are making which allegedly happened over a decade ago.\n\nVia CBS News:\n\n\u201cIt had been over a decade back from 2006 that, according to a Wall Street Journal expose published last week, porn celebrity Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, stated she\u2019d slept with billionaire \u201cApprentice\u201d host Donald Trump.\n\nBut outlets were chasing the story seemingly long before that.\n\nInTouch magazine Wednesday released a seven-year-old interview with Clifford, in which she states she\u2019d recurring sexual experiences with Mr. Trump after meeting him in July 2006.\n\n\u201cWhether you are a lover of his or not, which I never really was, you gotta admit he is pretty fascinating,\u201d Clifford said in the 2011 interview that the magazine published Wednesday. \u201cWe had really great banter. He told me that I was a person to be reckoned with, smart and beautiful just like his daughter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear with the publication didn\u2019t operate with the interview at the time.\n\nJacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of Slate, wrote an article in his book before this week also saying he spoke with Clifford about the alleged tryst at the moment, and between August and October 2016, before the election, the porn star was prepared to take her story people.\n\nAn old acquaintance of his in California was near a girl from the adult-film business who claimed to have had an affair with Donald Trump. I reached my friend\u2019s buddy, who placed me in touch with the celebrity, who\u2019s called Stormy Daniels.\n\nDaniels\u2026did really have a narrative about Trump, which she related to me in a series of phone conversations and text exchanges that took place between August and October of 2016.\u201d\n\nThree of Clifford\u2019s friends told Weisberg that they were conscious of the alleged affair at that time. Weisberg also published the screenshot of an unsigned document Clifford allegedly sent to him 2016.\n\nClifford was worried Mr. Trump would not cover, and she wished to be reimbursed somehow if she talked out instead, Weisberg wrote. Then, Weisberg said she stopped responding to his efforts at communication. He never published anything regarding the claims before the election.\n\n\u201cGiven what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn\u2019t believe an extramarital affair could be a highly significant story,\u201d Weisberg wrote.\n\nMore specifically, she said her attorney Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills\u2013based lawyer who specializes in claims against celebrities, had exercised the conditions with Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen.\u201d\n\nSlate wasn\u2019t the only book pursuing the story.\n\nA Fox News reporter, according to a CNN report, was also pursuing the story about the alleged event. Fox News writer Diana Falzone in October 2016 allegedly filed a story that included an on-the-record announcement from Clifford\u2019s supervisor at the time confirming the alleged event, also Falzone had viewed emails talking a settlement. However, Fox News shelved the narrative, according to the CNN report.\n\nClifford a week denied the affair asserts in a statement provided to CBS News.\n\n\u201cTo whom it may concern, I recently became aware that certain news outlets have been alleging that I had a sexual or romantic affair with Donald Trump guy, many, many years ago. I am stating with complete consent that this is totally false.\u201d\n\nThe buzz about \u201cStormy Daniels\u201d \u2014 she was trending on Twitter Friday \u2014 has seemingly died down as fast as it came. In the very first White House press briefing since the Wall Street Journal report, not one reporter asked about the narrative.\u201d\n\nFeatured Image Source H/T: ConservativePost\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i2.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/trump-jim-acosta.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ScreenShot2018-04-02at01.45.32.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i0.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-29-at-01.27.27.png?resize=687%2C411&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i0.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-12-at-22.38.51.png?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6730b12c26def9620da78c89c9bf586b?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://miamipost.co/wp-content/themes/zox-news/images/logos/logo-large.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i0.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/obama-pissed-trump.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8ea2b96ca8e00a3da848758642cb4f53?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i1.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/melania-stormy.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ScreenShot2018-04-02at01.45.32-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i1.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://i0.wp.com/miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-29-at-01.27.27.png?resize=687%2C411&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521/https://miamipost.co/2018/05/06/breaking-3-liberal-celebrities-arrested-for-conspiracy-to-assassinate-president-trump/", "title": "BREAKING: 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 170677513396654}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-29-at-01.27.27.png", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521/https://miamipost.co/2018/05/06/breaking-3-liberal-celebrities-arrested-for-conspiracy-to-assassinate-president-trump/", "title": "BREAKING: 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump", "description": "Liberals are on the streets.", "site_name": "Miami Post", "updated_time": "2018-05-06T19:18:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://miamipost.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-29-at-01.27.27.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513145521im_/https://miamipost.co/2018/05/06/breaking-3-liberal-celebrities-arrested-for-conspiracy-to-assassinate-president-trump/", "title": "BREAKING: 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump", "description": "Liberals have been going crazy ever since their hero, the criminal Hillary Clinton, lost the election.
