This is great news for American patriots everywhere, and we need to get behind it!\n\nAccording to various sources, FBI Director James Comey might soon be replaced by the Trump Administration. Even better, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is already being touted as Comey\u2019s successor, via US Defense Watch.\n\nFor those unaware of Gowdy\u2019s many accomplishments, suffice it to say that the South Carolina conservative has been one of the more vocal critics of the Obama Administration for quite some time now.\n\nMore recently, Representative Gowdy has been a voice of reason regarding the Democrat fixation on the idea of President Trump\u2019s supposed connections to Vladimir Putin. He\u2019s even gone on record defending California Republican Devin Nunes from Democrat attacks on his integrity and his ability to properly investigate whether Obama spied on Trump during the 2016 campaign, via Townhall.\n\nA long-time favorite of the Tea Party and other conservative groups, Gowdy is the type of man the Trump Administration needs to clean up the leftovers of the Obama Administration and its \u201cDeep State\u201d allies.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170626190612im_/http://snoopack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/trey.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170626190612im_/http://snoopack.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/trey.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170626190612/http://snoopack.com/2017/06/23/just-today-trey-gowdy-new-director-fbi/", "title": "JUST IN TODAY: Trey Gowdy Is The NEW DIRECTOR Of The FBI!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "JUST IN TODAY: Trey Gowdy Is The NEW DIRECTOR Of The FBI!", "description": "A huge new development in Washington, D.C. may be putting American security back on track.
