There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\n- It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\nRich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\n\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, \u201cAbsolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"\n\nWheeler also told us, \"I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can\u2019t share any information with you.\u2019 Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don\u2019t think it comes from the chief\u2019s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].\n\nA full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/lakana-fox-global/theme/images/wttg/logo-fox-5-washington-dc-wttg-alt.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/lakana-fox-global/theme/images/badge-app-store.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/lakana-fox-global/theme/images/wttg/placeholder-16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/lakana-fox-global/theme/images/wttg/placeholder-4x3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/media.fox5dc.com/photo/2016/08/25/Still0825_00018_1472181382501_1917472_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/lakana-fox-global/theme/images/wttg/placeholder-square.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628im_/http://static.lakana.com/media.fox5dc.com/photo/2016/08/25/Still0825_00018_1472181382501_1917472_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516030628/http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/254852337-story", "title": "Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death", "meta_data": {"description": "It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation&#39;s capital.
