It\u2019s all so clear now,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.\n\nAccording to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.\n\nBreaking: Paypal Now Available Many of you told us you wouldn't subscribe until we offered Paypal as a payment option.
