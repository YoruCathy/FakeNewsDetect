The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless\u201d or \u201cconscientious\u201d electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton\u2019s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation\u2019s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214im_/http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364-800x509.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214im_/http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214im_/http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213021214/http://usasnich.com/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president/", "title": "BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "noindex,follow", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT", "description": "BREAKING!
