Maybe not my generation, but certainly that of my kids.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the idea of using microchips in order to track the financial situations of welfare recipients has already been suggested by one politician in Finland.\n\nAccording to Sputnik News, a member of Finland\u2019s conservative Finn Party recently recommended implanting satellite-tracking chips inside of welfare recipients in response to news that some recipients continued to receive payments after leaving the country to fight for the Islamic State.\n\nPasi Maenranta, the politician who suggested the idea, argued on his Facebook page that in order to receive welfare payments from Kela, \u201cone has to tell exact data about your location using your personal code, read by a satellite.\u201d\n\nMaenranta also noted that it would be possible to implant microchips beneath the skin of all those traveling overseas \u201cwho for example receive medical welfare from Kela,\u201d also known as the Social Insurance Institution.\n\nBut regardless of how good the intentions may be, there are still a lot of questions that must be answered before the people of our country and elsewhere embrace the use of surgically implanted microchips.\n\nCan they ever be turned off or removed? Who exactly will have access to your location should the microchip be equipped with GPS technology?\n\nAnd if the microchips contain personal information regarding health and finances, will it be possible for that information to be hacked and potentially sold by a third party?\n\nIf Americans are serious about holding on to our Fourth Amendment right to privacy, then these are questions that we should all demand be answered before more advancements in microchip technology are made.\n\nSource humansarefree", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120021im_/http://www.unseen-pedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Small-Microchip-Tracking-Device-Antenna.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120021im_/http://www.unseen-pedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Small-Microchip-Tracking-Device-Antenna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120021/http://www.unseen-pedia.com/citizens-want-receive-gvt-benefits-must-agree-microchipped-near-future/", "title": "All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 1146718355343574}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future", "description": "All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120021/http://www.unseen-pedia.com/citizens-want-receive-gvt-benefits-must-agree-microchipped-near-future/", "site_name": "Anti News Network", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120021im_/http://www.unseen-pedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Small-Microchip-Tracking-Device-Antenna.jpg"}, "article": {"section": "Truth News", "published_time": "2018-01-12T02:43:06-07:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "(Natural News) Late last month, it was reported that a Wisconsin company called Three Square Market was planning on\u00a0surgically implanting", "title": "All Citizens Who Want to Receive Gvt Benefits Must Agree to Be Microchipped in the Near Future - Anti News Network", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180114120021im_/http://www.unseen-pedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Small-Microchip-Tracking-Device-Antenna.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.1", "ia": {"markup_url": "http://www.unseen-pedia.com/citizens-want-receive-gvt-benefits-must-agree-microchipped-near-future/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.unseen-pedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14908370_1782421858673034_4749262631277297409_n.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515750186.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
