The ship, which was supposed to be carrying \u201cemergency supplies,\u201d was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN:\n\n\u201cWe received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship, The Chelsea, was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didn\u2019t know what to expect, but what we found was simply\u2026surreal. In the middle of the ship\u2019s large manifest of containers, most of which were empty, we found 14 containing\u2026people. Yes, people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K, anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect.\u201d\n\nImmigration was immediately called and found that of the 460 people on board illegally, not one had been through any kind of vetting process. After running the men through facial recognition, they found more than a dozen suspected terrorists who are on the US no-fly list. Those men were about to be unleashed on the public for $40K each.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mmm-191x120.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BALTIMORE.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trump-National-Debt.001-1-191x120.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/OBAMA_0984-696x392-678x381-191x120.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952im_/http://dailyusaupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BALTIMORE.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170515100952/http://dailyusaupdate.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-cargo-ship-raided-port-baltimore-reveals-sick-secret/", "title": "BREAKING: Clinton Foundation Cargo Ship Raided At Port Of Baltimore Reveals Sick Secret", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A ship owned and operated by the Clinton Foundation was raided as it arrived from Africa this morning at the Port of Baltimore.
