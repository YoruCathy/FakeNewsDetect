During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.\n\nCNN\u2019s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.\n\nIn other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.\n\nFox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN\u2019s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN\u2019s 635K.\n\nWhile MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.\n\nIncredibly, CNN\u2019s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.\n\nCompared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.\n\nDuring the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.\n\nBy comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.\n\nMSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.\n\nThe third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC\u2019s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.\n\nDuring primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers. Fox nearly quadrupled CNN with 2.89 million viewers. MSNBC more than doubled CNN with 1.93 million.\n\nThe bottom line is that CNN\u2019s ongoing and well-documented credibility crisis has now come home to roost as a five-alarm ratings crisis.",
