To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,\u201d said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims.\n\nSims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.\n\nThe sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.\n\nBut it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.\n\nThe Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures \u2014 such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week \u2014 and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.\n\nOver the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year \u2014 and every year after 2013 \u2014 is continuing.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20106843087951-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/Joe-Biden-3-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Wuhan-Virology-Lab-200x133.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/GettyImages-1204091992-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/israel-virus-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/healthcare-workers-coronavirus-testing-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20072665032149-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Trump-on-Reopening-America-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Recall-Whitmer-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/beijing-laboratory-getty-images-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Screen-Shot-1-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Gov.-Whitmer-coronavirus-update-032020-27-1-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/coronavirus-testing-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/GettyImages-1219040747-e1587039822252-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_20070716685684-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/AP_19316687408780-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Guidance-for-Opening-Up-America-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/48012530193_fe43c9037e_o-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/social-distancing-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/wi/afp/30/2b0027_chinese-president-xi-jinping-centre-talks-facebook-chief-executive-mark-e1537998168298-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/George-Soros-200x150.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Gavin-Newsoms-Giveaway-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/", "title": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the USDA.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month", "description": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the USDA.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/02/07/food-stamp-enrollment-drops-4-million-one-month/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/store-accepts-snap-ebt-food-stamps-file-getty.jpg", "width": 447, "height": 335, "alt": "NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 19: A grocery store advertises that they accept food stamps in the South Bronx on September 19, 2013 in New York City. According to the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau report, over a quarter-million people in the South Bronx are living in poverty, making the 16th Congressional District the poorest in the nation. New Census Bureau numbers for all of New York City show that the poverty rate has risen to 21.2 percent in 2012, from 20.9 percent the year before. As New Yorkers prepare to vote for their next mayor following Michael Bloomberg, the Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio has focused on the theme that New York has transformed into a 'tale of two cities' under the Bloomberg administration.
