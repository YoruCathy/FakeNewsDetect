After an embarrassing opening to a game with the worst ratings in Saints\u2019 history, the players and coaches learned that their actions have consequences.\n\nBoth the pilot and co-pilot of the Boeing 737 the Saints use to travel are combat-hardened American heroes. They flew sorties over Baghdad with Saddam\u2019s best weapons firing back. They fought with their lives for your freedom and watched many of their friends die. Today they took a stand for those brave souls:\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be a party to the disrespect. We waited until we were cleared and last off the runway for the night , walked out of the cockpit, took a knee and deplaned. They\u2019re not going anywhere until tomorrow.\u201d\n\nLooks like the group of thugs should have just considered themselves lucky they\u2019re allowed to make millions for playing a game and stood with respect like they\u2019re told to do in the league rulebook.\n\nThis week was the worst week in NFL history for ratings. Next week will be worse.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171006102225im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a197f8bc01e406b3db29bf11be7b5202?s=60&d=mm&r=g",
