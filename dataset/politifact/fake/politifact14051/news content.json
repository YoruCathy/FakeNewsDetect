I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you\u201d \u2013 Trump warned.\n\nTrump went on to invite all Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.\n\n\u201cAs this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.\u201d \u2013 Trump urged.\n\nRussia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah\u2019s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia\u2019s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.\n\nThe case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.\n\nThe Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the group\u2019s administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russia\u2019s ministry of justice and deem the \u2018Administrative Centre of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia\u2019 organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,\u201d said judge Yuri Ivanenko. \u201cThe property of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses organization is to be confiscated to the state revenue.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents \u201cpose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public security\u201d.\n\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses, who are known for door-to-door preaching and handing out literature, reject some of mainstream Christianity\u2019s core beliefs and have more than 8.3 million members around the world", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/berli-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://fox-news24.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/russia-jehovahs-witnesses-1024x768.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/President-Donald-Trump-warns.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/U1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mosco-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/mosco-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/berli-300x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/President-Donald-Trump-warns.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914/http://states-tv.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/", "title": "Trump warns Russia over Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/President-Donald-Trump-warns.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Donald Trump has sent a strong message to the Russia Federation over the country's ban on the \"peaceful activities\" of Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nTrump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the country's own constitution against them.\n\n\"You know right that this", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "States TV", "title": "Trump warns Russia over Jehovah's Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US", "updated_time": "2017-04-25T08:04:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/President-Donald-Trump-warns.jpg", "card": "summary", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170506030914im_/http://states-tv.com/trump-warns-russia-over-jehovahs-witnesses-ban-and-urges-members-to-seek-asylum-in-the-us/", "title": "Trump warns Russia over Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US", "description": "President Donald Trump has sent a strong message to the Russia Federation over the country\u2019s ban on the \u201cpeaceful activities\u201d of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.
