The call\u2019s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism.\u201d\n\nAnother development involving the U.S. Senate race in Alabama. At least one person in our viewing area received a robocall seeking more damaging information about Roy Moore. Here is the text of that voicemail message received by Pastor Al Moore in Creola.\n\n\u201cHi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I\u2019m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5000 and $7000 dollars. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report. I can be reached by email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com, thank you.\u201d\n\nPastor Moore says he\u2019s baffled about who might be behind the message. He said he sent a response to the email address provided but it came back undeliverable. We also tried the email address with the same result.\n\nJohn Rogers with the Roy Moore campaign says it\u2019s the first he\u2019s heard of this type of robocall. We contacted the Washington Post but it would be highly unlikely that a newspaper would offer thousands of dollars for information, damaging or otherwise. We searched and could not find a record of a \u2018Bernie\u2019 or \u2018Al Bernstein\u2019 who works as a reporter at the Washington Post.\n\nIf any of you have received the same call, please let us know at producers@wkrg.com", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171114225401im_/https://mgtvwkrg.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/bill-riales.jpg?w=44&h=44&crop=1",
