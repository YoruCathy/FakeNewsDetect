According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple\u2019s southern California home.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when this would come up,\u201d Bannon told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we\u2019re on the subject, I\u2019m actually disappointed; I honestly didn\u2019t expect them to take this long,\u201d he said laughingly.\n\nAsked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, \u201cWell, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren\u2019t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It\u2019s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.\u201d\n\nBut, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, \u201cAlright, look, that\u2019s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you\u2019re not supposed to in a relationship, that\u2019s the whole beauty of it. And just like there\u2019s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you\u2019re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don\u2019t mean that in everyday life. I\u2019m talking about when they\u2019re performing their marital duties,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why I find these charges preposterous, they\u2019re so idiotic that I\u2019m not even sure how they\u2019re still interesting,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cBecause, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re in love, everything\u2019s allowed, I don\u2019t care what anyone says, when you say the words \u2018I do,\u2019 and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?\u201d he concluded.\n\nsource:politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2013-06-25-at-1.41.27-PM-645x325-145x100.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hqdefault-1-7-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/hqdefault-1-7-645x325-375x195.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/eee-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/14794121_10207122287991707_882992538_n-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-21-at-7.40.42-PM-730x480-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/160714123057-donald-trump-mike-pence-large-169-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/800px-Donald_Trump_by_Gage_Skidmore_2-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Stephen-Bannon-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Stephen-Bannon-645x325.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Stephen-Bannon-645x325.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161122152424/http://uspoln.com/2016/11/14/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love/", "title": "Stephen Bannon: \u201cNobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It\u2019s Out Of Love\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Stephen Bannon: \u201cNobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It\u2019s Out Of Love\u201d", "description": "The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him.
