He\u2019s a working-class man whose job is in retail, scoring him $11.66/hour. Thanks to Medicaid he\u2019s being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. \u201cMy question is pretty straightforward,\u201d Kline told Price. \u201cWhy do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?\u201d Price\u2019s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. \u201cI took care of a lot of patients with cancer,\u201d Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what you\u2019re doing here, because you\u2019re essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most?\u201d Kline wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cAre you saying you actually want people to be okay with that?\u201d Price thought for a second, then replied: \u201cLook, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyone\u2019s life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me \u2013 I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people who\u2019ve got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since he\u2019s the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, I\u2019m not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else we\u2019re looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut simply, we have to plug some holes \u2013 of which, by the way, there are plenty \u2013 and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones,\u201d the orthopedic surgeon added. \u201cUnfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know it\u2019s not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer \u2013 I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about, Brian \u2013 they can\u2019t lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the risk of sounding insensitive, we\u2019ve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, it\u2019s better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, it\u2019s a lousy way to live anyway, and I\u2019m sorry to say it out loud, but it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Price concluded.", "images": ["https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewsLo-Logo-1.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=120&d=https%3A%2F%2Fpoliticot.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fminify%2F_ui%2Fimages%2Fcommon%2Favatar.jpg&r=g", "https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewsLo-Logo-w.png", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tom_Price.jpg", "https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewsLo-Logo-c.png"], "top_img": "https://newslo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tom_Price.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://newslo.com/price-better-budget-cancer-patients-die-quickly/", "title": "Tom Price: \u201cIt\u2019s Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brian Kline is the type of person who voted for President Donald Trump in November.
