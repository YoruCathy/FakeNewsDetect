Darrell Castle, the candidate for the Constitution Party, is on the ballot in more than two dozen states. Castle said his campaign has faced ballot access obstacles in California, Texas and Oklahoma. \u201cThose states are virtually impossible for a party like mine because they cost so much money,\u201d Castle said.\n\nCastle isn\u2019t on the ballot in Oklahoma. To be on the ballot there required signatures from at least 3 percent of all votes cast in the state in 2012, or about 40,000 signatures. Castle says this would likely require hiring professionals who often charge a few dollars for each signature.\n\nRoque \u201cRocky\u201d De La Fuente is running as an independent and is on the ballot in 20 states. As other non-major-party candidates have promised to do, De La Fuente has mounted several legal challenges for ballot access.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-notrunning-280.jpg?c=85", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/what-early-voters-missed/img/early-voting-promo.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_48h/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/30/Interactivity/Images/Campaign2016Star-24px-high.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-policies-980.jpg?c=49", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-sampleballots-280.jpg?c=334", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/paths-to-victory/img/paths-to-victory-promo.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/11/01/National-Politics/Graphics/new-promo.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-notrunning-600.jpg?c=625", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-policies-600.jpg?c=660", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-major-280.jpg?c=126", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-fec-280.jpg?c=362", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-major-980.jpg?c=167", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-sampleballots-600.jpg?c=240", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatesperstate-280.jpg?c=211", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-sampleballots-980.jpg?c=195", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-lesserknown-280.jpg?c=208", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/2300-writein-promo.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-policies-280.jpg?c=213", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/10/27/National-Politics/Graphics/wikipedia-editing-graphic-promo-v2.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-lesserknown-600.jpg?c=246", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatesperstate-600.jpg?c=436", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/writein-candidatemaps-major-600.jpg?c=328"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/img/2300-writein-promo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Lu", "Kevin Uhrmacher"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/write-in-votes/", "title": "Thinking about writing in a candidate on Election Day?
