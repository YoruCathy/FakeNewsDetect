He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.\n\nWhen asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was \u201cproud\u201d he didn\u2019t have any scientific credentials or education, because \u201cscientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.\u201d Asked to elaborate, he said that he was \u201cglad\u201d to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, \u201cdisappointed\u201d as to where he was assigned. \u201cWhile I can certainly appreciate President Trump\u2019s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can\u2019t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they\u2019re just wasting their time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I get back home from work \u2013 believe me \u2013 I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,\u201d Clovis continued. \u201cI\u2019m proud I\u2019m not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they can\u2019t see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, that\u2019s a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? They\u2019re the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. They\u2019re so narrow-minded that they can\u2019t except that we\u2019re different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. It\u2019s funny when you really think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m happy I\u2019m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don\u2019t even consider the fact that there\u2019s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It\u2019s as funny as it is pitiful,\u201d he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump\u2019s pick for top scientist if that\u2019s how he feels about it, he replied, \u201cWell, just because you\u2019re a member of the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,\u201d Clovis concluded.\n\nSOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-6.56.07-PM-730x480-380x260.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cnn_sotu_cruz_children_131020a-615x345-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hqdefault-645x325-375x195.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/b86fb2e8de61ad203b4c1b3a3332583d-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Donald_Trump_Laconia_Rally_Laconia_NH_4_by_Michael_Vadon_July_16_2015_20-645x325-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Hannity-640x427-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/170524105415-blake-farenthold-full-169-640x360-145x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sam-Clovis-Donald-Trump-Dubuque-Iowa-Screenshot-618x325.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/RR1pSns7-645x325-375x195.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-24-at-6.23.21-PM-730x480-145x100.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/b86fb2e8de61ad203b4c1b3a3332583d-380x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mike-huckabee-645x325-380x260.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mike-huckabee-645x325-145x100.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cnn_sotu_cruz_children_131020a-615x345-645x325-380x260.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sam-Clovis-Donald-Trump-Dubuque-Iowa-Screenshot-618x325.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400/http://uspoln.com/2017/05/20/trumps-top-scientist-pick-scientists-just-dumb-regular-people-think-dinosaurs-existed-earth-getting-warmer/", "title": "Trump\u2019s Top Scientist Pick: \u201cScientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trump\u2019s Top Scientist Pick: \u201cScientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer\u201d", "description": "The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the \u201cchief scientist\u201d is supposed to be the leader \u201camong distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn\u2019t seem to have any of \u2026", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400/http://uspoln.com/2017/05/20/trumps-top-scientist-pick-scientists-just-dumb-regular-people-think-dinosaurs-existed-earth-getting-warmer/", "site_name": "USPOLN", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sam-Clovis-Donald-Trump-Dubuque-Iowa-Screenshot-618x325.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 325}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/uspoln/", "section": "POLITICS", "published_time": "2017-05-20T12:45:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the \u201cchief scientist\u201d is supposed to be the leader \u201camong distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn\u2019t seem to have any of [\u2026]", "title": "Trump\u2019s Top Scientist Pick: \u201cScientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer\u201d", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527174400im_/http://uspoln.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sam-Clovis-Donald-Trump-Dubuque-Iowa-Screenshot-618x325.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.7.5", "fb": {"app_id": 1112629802167457}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495209600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
