In the past two weeks, after receiving a...\n\n\u201cNOS\u201d stands for \u201cNovus Ordo Seclorum,\u201d or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama\u2019s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:\n\nAlong with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama\u2019s \u201cteam\u201d has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation\u2019s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.\n\nHow embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.\n\nThe extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place \u2014 along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC \u2014 is on the list.\n\nThis is no joke, patriots. If Obama\u2019s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren\u2019t your friends. Get out of the house and don\u2019t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zdjCL-FBUkk/We6z15yHzsI/AAAAAAAABsA/_nOwzfTPkeo6BWVgWiVqcZwTyI6WvLDjwCLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/Capture-30.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GCZgnTmPMBk/VdPrZ1MUYXI/AAAAAAAALt4/kDPp85Zxj3w/s1600/ie-share-twiiter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w3Nej6-Lwfk/VdPrZJsHYLI/AAAAAAAALts/A-8fIlSRVAk/s1600/ie-share-google-plus.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/-l6rOV5nFTQwe2LhpQuUSb_doMBZiHlNhTNtJAVUSHlmlncskxz5gHZclik-oeuEg7OOWqcXVrsXjH4D_z16Wj-w_WejsLSQfUNy8zX-lBRp4CWZBbF014kO9_yKMtNtlQciVzpAwcMTGPqWh-gewZ0_j1X8OtIIPcjgudoKdpxTd8fC=w72-h72-p-k-no-nu", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PHnA3dCaqI4/VdPrZGg-MHI/AAAAAAAALtw/907msPmkj1c/s1600/ie-share-pinterest.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yhtupG4S4pY/VdPrZP56fII/AAAAAAAALto/tfRtn6o16JY/s1600/ie-share-facebook.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-23cKHQnn8dg/WtHLk7KHKdI/AAAAAAAABL8/r-pLNzmeLQ0nPkrwEBl_D71eQvsfc_Z6QCLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiGoJeHK3v4/WtHIVsnm52I/AAAAAAAABLU/IxhNKUTVtgwcdFKHaxn_vBosdFbf7puyACLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p_613EKeiXI/WtHMyjoEpFI/AAAAAAAABMY/0_h6sOGnQNEOTjOzkpqNJ2ZWS_r7Y9uCACLcBGAs/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jj9bwNByuMU/WtEseQk6gkI/AAAAAAAAAM8/EIjIWTx21hUwC98viimsvbi0civc62EqwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/NEWSFEEDUSA.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t9GOLY75v-0/WrDIbpkd0-I/AAAAAAAAFaU/LqA6YVTh5rwiwNvVS_FJpe1fnz_1z--sgCK4BGAYYCw/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/queen-snubs-michelle1-678x381.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/s640/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nLOD5b-4iSY/WtEsfERvAsI/AAAAAAAAANE/h2MyIEFeEnAAnUw6wJXb2X5R-IaHe0WsACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/NEWSFEEDUSA.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930im_/https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X0VOA0H0GP4/Ws-Ue3ijtMI/AAAAAAAAFtc/3w1k2V4yfncD5IFmVJFWNf6WZMnZdJliwCK4BGAYYCw/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1920%2B%25281%2529.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930/http://www.newsfeedusa.us/2018/04/obamas-private-security-company-sets-up.html", "title": "OBAMA\u2019S PRIVATE \u2018SECURITY\u2019 COMPANY SETS UP MASSIVE CAMPS OUTSIDE 3 MAJOR CITIES", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 390495944492948, "app_id": 1729569823961217}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0", "generator": "blogger", "og": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180418134930/http://www.newsfeedusa.us/2018/04/obamas-private-security-company-sets-up.html", "title": "OBAMA\u2019S PRIVATE \u2018SECURITY\u2019 COMPANY SETS UP MASSIVE CAMPS OUTSIDE 3 MAJOR CITIES", "description": "Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government.
