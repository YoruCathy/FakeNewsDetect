In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.\n\nDonald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren\u2019t even required to give them.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/spec-480x384.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nastywoman-678x381.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sarah-Huckabee-Sanders-696x374-480x374.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3bd18071be8145f7830c9c957db88ff5?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LOGO.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/michelle-obamas-secret-480x317.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/noooos-480x384.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/trump-2-480x274.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4efeb444e3b493521b42cfb31b12d206?s=60&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621im_/http://dailyfeed.news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nastywoman-678x381.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171016054621/http://dailyfeed.news/san-juan-city-council-votes-unanimously-to-impeach-trump-hating-mayor/", "title": "San Juan City Council Votes Unanimously To Impeach Trump-Hating Mayor", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "San Juan City Council Votes Unanimously To Impeach Trump-Hating Mayor", "description": "When Donald Trump hinted that he may end aid to Puerto Rico over the mayor of San Juan\u2019s decision to withhold aid from the rest of the country, the city\u2019s other leaders finally took action.
