Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she\u2019s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn\u2019t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.\n\n\n\nFiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore \u201cgroped her in the alley behind the\u201d church they both attended in 1957. \u201cIt was the most horrifying moment of my life,\u201d she told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. \u201cRoy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,\u201d she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.\n\n\n\nMaddow then interviewed Dourif\u2019s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn\u2019t say anything until he was running for Senator because they \u201cfeared for their lives.\u201d Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.\n\n\n\nOne piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion \u201cshe\u201d and her \u201chusband\u201d Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit\u2019s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that \u201cDourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy would Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office \u2013 someone of the opposing party,\u201d Johnson writes. \u201cThis stinks more than Malia Obama\u2019s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/departedme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/111-15.png?fit=678%2C381", "https://www.nscdscamps.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logo.png"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/departedme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/111-15.png?fit=678%2C381", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nscdscamps.org/blog/category/parenting/467344", "title": "UPDATE: Second Roy Moore Accuser Works For Michelle Obama Right NOW - Departed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Liberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore.
