Loretta Elizabeth Lynch, an American attorney who served as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015 to succeed Eric Holder. Loretta Lynch, a political giant who held that post for Barack Obama said, under ideal conditions, it is also the \u201ctoughest job in government.\u201d\n\nRosenstein, the hapless establishment Republican ousted as Deputy Attorney General on Monday December 4, 2017 lasted a smidgeon over few days. After days of increasingly public concerns over the likelihood of Mueller\u2019s dismissal by Trump and amidst Trump\u2019s former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, Mr Rosenstein is being replaced by Neil Gorsuch, who was recently nominated by Trump for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe reshuffle puts Mr Rosenstein out of his misery and confirms Mr Trump\u2019s fondness for surrounding himself with tough-as-nails generals, who already fill several top jobs in his government. It ends the fear of Trump administration being damaged by Flynn\u2019s plea to Mueller\u2019s investigation team.\n\nThese are not anything like ideal circumstances for Mr Neil Gorsuch. New holder of the toughest job in government, the ex-clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992, and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, from 1993 to 1994. He currently was serving as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. How long Mr Neil Gorsuch lasts is anyone\u2019s guess. If he only emerges with his dignity intact and adhere to the orders and principles of Trump\u2019s administration, he will have done better than his predecessor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s interview with the New York Times on Wednesday stirred speculation he might consider firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller for investigating Trump\u2019s business dealings as part of the Russia probe.\n\nBut Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Mueller\u2019s probe. Firing the Deputy Attorney General simply means setting off a chain-reaction that would throw the Justice Department into upheaval and consequently reaching his target to fire Robert Mueller under his dictatorship.\n\nHe\u2019d certainly begun by dismissing Rosenstein, whose political loyalties Trump questioned in the Times interview on Wednesday in which he also warned Mueller against broadening his investigation. Such a scenario would parallel President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1973 \u201cSaturday Night Massacre,\u201d when Nixon forced out the top two officials in the Justice Department in order to oust the Watergate special counsel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s politically survivable, and it\u2019s not clear how much collateral damage he will do, putting himself into a position to have somebody fire Mueller,\u201d said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island.\n\nExpanding Investigation\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation has expanded to examine a broad range of transactions involving the president\u2019s businesses, including dealings by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg News. Trump told the Times that if Mueller examined his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia he\u2019d consider it \u201ca violation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no possible way anybody at the White House could be seriously thinking about firing Mueller,\u201d said Senate Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to comment on that because that\u2019s so far out of bounds it couldn\u2019t possibly be a serious discussion.\u201d\n\nUndercutting Mueller\n\nTrump has indicated he would try to undercut Mueller\u2019s credibility. In the New York Times interview, Trump said Mueller has \u201cmany other conflicts that I haven\u2019t said, but I will at some point.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the Washington Post reported Thursday night that Trump\u2019s legal team was exploring ways to question Mueller by building a case that he has conflicts of interest in overseeing the investigation. The Post also cited one unidentified person familiar with the effort as saying that Trump has asked his advisers about his authority to grant pardons to aides, family members or even himself.",
