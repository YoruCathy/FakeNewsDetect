{"url": "https://lidblog.com/illegal-immigrant-mexican-kids/", "text": "It was June 2014 when the Washington Post reported that illegal immigrants, \u201cincluding thousands of women and children, stream into south Texas. It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama\u2019s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment.\n\nIt was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges\u2013 no trial\u2013just belief.\n\nHis intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 \u2014 teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught \u2014 and he wanted to attack this loophole. Trending: How Can We Have Two Systems of Justice in This Country? \u201cWhy don\u2019t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?\u201d Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. take our poll - story continues below Trump or Biden, who will win?

Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held \u2014 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states.\n\nLets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don\u2019t want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in \u201cfacilities\u201d so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that the program\u2019s real intent is to interrogate the kids,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are \u201coften questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.\u201d While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer\u2019s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative\u2019s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border.\n\nBut the program was a surprise to Mexico\n\n\u201cThe moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn\u2019t an announcement,\u201d said Reyna Torres Mend\u00edvil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry\u2019s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. \u201cWhere were they taking these children?\u201d\n\nRegarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican.\n\nBelow is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.\n\n\ufeff\n\nNote: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.\n\nillegal immigrants\n\nillegal immigrants\n\nillegal immigrants", "images": ["https://lidblog.com/wp-content/plugins/api-by-klicked-master/assets/reverereport.png", "https://flagandcross.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/QhBf5DgR-200x160.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-5uGb3auy8aqru.gif", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flynn425-425x239-1-200x160.jpg", "https://trueconservativepundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Greg-Laurie-devotion-2.jpg", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2cd1h2.jpg", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Whatfinger250x250.jpg", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-9.15.18-PM-400x250.png", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thelid-logo.png", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flynn425-425x239-1-400x250.jpg", "https://rightwingtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capture1474-200x160.jpg", "https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/external-content.duckduckgo-3-1-200x160.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3wvu54-400x250.jpg", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2cd1h2-1200x630.jpg", "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vernon-jones-endorses-trump-400x250.jpg"], "top_img": "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2cd1h2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeff Dunetz"], "canonical_link": "https://lidblog.com/illegal-immigrant-mexican-kids/", "title": "Obama Administration Kept Illegal Mexican Kids In Detention Camps As \u201cExperiment\u201d", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 961038380624167, "app_id": 1642164452726811}, "description": "Obama's border agents were tossing some child illegal immigrants into internment camps as an experiment, without charges, judges, or a trial", "robots": "noimageindex", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Obama Administration Kept Illegal Mexican Kids In Detention Camps As \"Experiment\"", "description": "Obama's border agents were tossing some child illegal immigrants into internment camps as an experiment, without charges, judges, or a trial", "url": "https://lidblog.com/illegal-immigrant-mexican-kids/", "site_name": "The Lid", "updated_time": "2018-06-17T12:24:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2cd1h2.jpg", "secure_url": "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2cd1h2.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 338}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.dunetz", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jeffrey.dunetz", "section": "Crime", "published_time": "2018-06-17T01:59:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-17T12:24:26+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Obama's border agents were tossing some child illegal immigrants into internment camps as an experiment, without charges, judges, or a trial", "title": "Obama Administration Kept Illegal Mexican Kids In Detention Camps As \"Experiment\"", "site": "@yidwithlid", "image": "https://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2cd1h2.jpg", "creator": "@yidwithlid"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "viewport": "initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "googlebot": "noimageindex"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6UhnHxyn4hU"], "publish_date": 1529200751.0, "source": "https://lidblog.com", "summary": ""}
