But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.\n\nAxios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, \u201cIn loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem\u2019s finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nRelated: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich\u2019s Murder\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.\n\nMedia reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, \u201cThose who have suggested that Seth\u2019s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.\u201d\n\nSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty\n\nRich appears elsewhere in Brazile\u2019s book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich\u2019s murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.\n\nBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.\u201d\n\nBrazile had spoken publicly about Rich\u2019s death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, \u201cSeth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth\u2019s legacy to his country and party is shameful.\u201d About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, \u201cSeth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.\u201d\n\nThrough spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, \u201cSince Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family\u2019s efforts to find Seth\u2019s killers.\u201d\n\nIn the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters seemed \u201cantiseptic, like a hospital,\u201d and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a \u201cslave.\u201d In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.\n\nFormer aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile\u2019s claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, \u201cIt is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nBrazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/05/16/0516sethrichwikileaks.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/06/20/0620sethrichprofilingproject.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/05/19/0519sethrichrussiatweet.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/05/23/0523kimdotcomsethrich.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452/http://www.newsweek.com/donna-brazile-book-seth-rich-dnc-murder-conspiracy-702838", "title": "DNC\u2019s Donna Brazile Dedicated Her Book to \u2018Patriot\u2019 Seth Rich, Whose Death Made Her Fear for Her Own Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "donna, brazile, chairwoman, chair, chairperson, chairman, democratic, national, committee, dnc, book, hack, hillary, clinton, 2016, presidential, election, campaign, seth, rich, staffer, wikileaks, murder, murdered, killed, theory, suspect, conspiracy", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452/http://www.newsweek.com/donna-brazile-book-seth-rich-dnc-murder-conspiracy-702838", "title": "DNC\u2019s Donna Brazile dedicated her book to \u201cpatriot\u201d Seth Rich", "description": "Rich\u2019s mysterious death was the subject of conspiracy theories.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "section": "U.S.", "modified_time": "2017-11-06T12:05:56-05:00", "published_time": "2017-11-06T11:38:11-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsweek", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "DNC\u2019s Donna Brazile dedicated her book to \u201cpatriot\u201d Seth Rich", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://www.newsweek.com/donna-brazile-book-seth-rich-dnc-murder-conspiracy-702838", "description": "Rich\u2019s mysterious death was the subject of conspiracy theories.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171106195452im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/11/06/1106donnabrazilesethrich.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Rich\u2019s mysterious death was the subject of conspiracy theories."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509986291.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
