To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so important\u2026if you haven\u2019t read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!\n\nAnd things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming \u201choaxes.\u201d He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing Ivanka\u2019s merchandise (they were, that\u2019s why they pulled the line).\n\nThe worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. That\u2019s right, he tweeted \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn\u2019t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.\u201d\n\nUm, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we\u2019ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he\u2019s certainly complicit and he\u2019s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn\u2019t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.\n\nThis is terrifying, and there\u2019s never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country. If you are ready to join the opposition but aren\u2019t quite sure how to get involved, take this grassroots call to action today!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cnn_conway_160925a-800x430-665x357.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-44-665x347.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-08-at-2.37.13-AM.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Navarro-Brewer.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1_Primary_logo_on_transparent_512.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-44-665x347.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839/http://liberalplug.com/2017/02/11/gop-official-says-america-needs-another-911-shares-_______________-trump/", "title": "GOP Official Who Says America Needs \u201cAnother 9/11\u201d Shares _______________ With Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "GOP Official Who Says America Needs \"Another 9/11\" Shares _______________ With Trump - liberalplug.com", "site_name": "liberalplug.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217234839im_/http://liberalplug.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-44.png", "width": 400, "height": 209}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "description": "The resistance against\u00a0Trump must continue\u2026these aren\u2019t just small ideological differences being played out, or debates where both sides should be calmly and distantly considered.
