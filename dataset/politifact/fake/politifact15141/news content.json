In a 5-3 decision, that was not a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public school is the United States will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to our source, USA Politics Today, the students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.\n\nJudge Neil Gorsuch wrote, \u201cThe government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn\u2019t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion.\n\nWe should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn\u2019t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a \u2018religion of peace\u2019 when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.\u201d\n\nGorsuch continued, \u201cIt is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.\u201d\n\nThe Obama Administration forced the children to learn about Islam as the \u201cReligion of Peace,\u201d only so that they could be more tolerant of the terrorists. But those days are over now. Our country and Christianity made a huge victory.\n\nThanks to our President Donald Trump, we can go back to respecting our true values and the worshiping of the one and only true God.\n\nScroll down to the comments and tell us what you think.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-12-1200x630-compressed-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/http://nowtrump.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag/images/logos/logo-large.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/http://nowtrump.com/wp-content/themes/flex-mag/images/logos/logo-nav.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4119256700000578-4570870-image-a-2_1496592108170-696x392-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4119256700000578-4570870-image-a-2_1496592108170-696x392-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/xc-2-compressed-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/xc-2-compressed-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1-12-1200x630-compressed-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-fists-sp-rep-696x365.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-fists-sp-rep-696x365.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042/https://nowtrump.com/2018/03/breaking-supreme-court-sides-with-trump-this-changes-everything/", "title": "BREAKING: Supreme Court Sides With Trump\u2013This Changes Everything! \u2013 NowTrump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180311052042im_/https://nowtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trump-fists-sp-rep-696x365.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Donald Trump.
