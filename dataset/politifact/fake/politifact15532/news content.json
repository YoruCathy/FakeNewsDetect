What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise\u2026\n\nHe has an actual strategic policy behind his plan.\n\nApparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention.\n\nAMLO\u2019s key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexico\u2019s plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do.\n\nReported by 100percentfedup: Well\u2026at least a leader of Mexico is admitting what\u2019s been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades\u2026\n\nOpen borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America.\n\nLa Raza aka \u201cThe Race\u201d is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups:\n\nGEORGE SOROS\u2019S OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty.\n\nTHE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO\u2026 Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador aka AMLO:\n\n(From the Daily Caller) [\u2026] \u201cAnd soon, very soon \u2014 after the victory of our movement \u2014 we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,\u201d Obrador said, adding that immigrants \u201cmust leave their towns and find a life in the United States.\u201d He then declared it as \u201ca human right we will defend.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLO\u2019s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.\n\nFrom the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WeSupportDT-HeaderSmallHeight.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.americanjournalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-23-at-7.17.45-AM.png?resize=771%2C514", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-23-at-7.13.46-AM.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/next-signal-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-23-at-7.13.46-AM-300x169.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-23-at-7.13.46-AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/mexico-next-president-invasion-2-b/", "title": "MEXICO\u2019S NEXT PRESIDENT Calls for An Invasion Of The US\u2026.", "meta_data": {"og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/mexico-next-president-invasion-2-b/", "title": "MEXICO\u2019S NEXT PRESIDENT Calls for An Invasion Of The US\u2026.", "description": "We are literally under attack...", "site_name": "We Support Donald Trump", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180702032513im_/http://wesupportdonaldtrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-23-at-7.13.46-AM.png"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
