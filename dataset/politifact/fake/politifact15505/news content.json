Disturbingly, the fate of many of these children, mostly migrants, remains unknown.\n\nNY Mag reports: Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government\u2019s handling of migrants.\n\n\u201cIt is intolerable that human trafficking \u2014 modern-day slavery \u2014 could occur in our own backyard,\u201d Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New York Times. \u201cBut what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.\u201d\n\nAs detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans \u2014 and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters.\n\nThe department performed check-in visits at caretakers\u2019 homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to the report.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s investigation built on an Associated Press report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were placed in homes where they were sexually abused, starved, or forced into slave labor. HHS claimed that it lacked the funds and authorities that a more rigorous screening process would have required.\n\nHowever, the investigation also found that HHS did not spend all of the money allocated to it for handling the crisis.\n\nThe agency placed 90,000 migrant children into sponsor care between 2013 and 2015. Exactly how many of those fell prey to traffickers is unknown, because the agency does not keep track.", "images":
