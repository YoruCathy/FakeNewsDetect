During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate\u2019s version of the health care bill is signed into law. \u201cWhat they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy something they don\u2019t want, then they won\u2019t buy it,\u201d the Speaker opined. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it\u2019s that people will choose not to buy something that they don\u2019t like or want.\u201d\n\nKilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is \u201ca choice.\u201d \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been over on more than once occasion,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI know why you\u2019re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I\u2019m sorry Brian, but it\u2019s not working. And the reason why it\u2019s not working is, you\u2019re using the wrong logic here. You\u2019re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don\u2019t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?\u201d Ryan opined. \u201cThe answer is \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that\u2019s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that\u2019s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you\u2019re doomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing rich or poor is a matter of choice; that\u2019s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they\u2019re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we\u2019d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We\u2019d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. \u2018Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen \u2013 the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don\u2019t even have to get a job.\u2019 That\u2019s preposterous, anyone who thinks that\u2019s a good thing deserves to be poor,\u201d he concluded.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5435034759_7c74028c26_b.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/craig-cobb-white-supremacist-souls-of-black-women-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/11-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sean-Spicer-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/paul-ryan.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/paul-ryan-645x325.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656im_/http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/paul-ryan.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170628093656/http://politicot.com/paul-ryan-22-million-americans-choose-poor-problem-cant-afford-healthy/", "title": "Paul Ryan: \u201c22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It\u2019s Their Own Problem If They Can\u2019t Afford To Be Healthy\u201d", "meta_data": {"verifyownership": "b03b12e9fdf4f032d48fc78bfadcdc32", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Paul Ryan: \u201c22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It\u2019s Their Own Problem If They Can\u2019t Afford To Be Healthy\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the Republican health care plan.
