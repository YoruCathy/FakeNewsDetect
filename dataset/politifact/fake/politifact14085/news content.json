O\u2019Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That\u2019s when the \u201ctolerant\u201d liberals got violent.\n\nOne of the men grabbed O\u2019Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.\n\nO\u2019Reilly was taken to St. Vincent\u2019s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.\n\nThe family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O\u2019Reilly \u201cgot what he deserved\u201d for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.\n\nLiberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don\u2019t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be \u201ctortured,\u201d but it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he\u2019s done.\n\nLiberalism is truly a mental disorder.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933im_/http://usleader.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Clipboard01-2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933im_/http://usleader.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933im_/http://usleader.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933/http://usleader.net/index.php/2017/05/11/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals/", "title": "BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933/http://usleader.net/index.php/2017/05/11/breaking-bill-oreilly-critical-condition-attacked-tolerant-liberals/", "site_name": "US Leader", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933im_/http://usleader.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg", "width": 678, "height": 381}}, "article": {"tag": "Critical", "section": "POLITICS", "published_time": "2017-05-11T15:58:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was", "title": "BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170516012933im_/http://usleader.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.7.4", "ca_title": "BREAKING: Bill O\u2019Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By \u2018Tolerant\u2019 Liberals", "ca_image": "http://usleader.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1-150x150.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494432000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
